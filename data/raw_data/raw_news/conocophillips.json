            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: ConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is primarily involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Considering proved reserves and production, the company is among the largest explorers and producers in the world. The company, founded in 1875, has a strong presence across conventional and unconventional plays in 13 countries. ConocoPhillips\u2019 low-risk and cost-effective operations are spread across North America, Asia, Australia and Europe.\n\nCOP is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 12.66; value investors should take notice.\n\nSix analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.41 to $8.05 per share. COP also boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.1%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, COP should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in ConocoPhillips (COP)?\n\nBefore you invest in ConocoPhillips (COP), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Energy Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best energy stocks to invest in according to billionaires.\n\nAfter significantly lagging behind in 2024, the broader energy sector finally seems to be doing better now with gains of 6.21% since the beginning of 2025, against a decline of 3.42% by the wider market during the period.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Nuclear Power Stocks To Buy Now\n\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence boom is a significant growth driver for the energy industry, as its accompanying data centers consume 10 to 50 times the amount of energy per square foot of a typical commercial office building. According to the Department of Energy, the energy use by America\u2019s data centers could reach between 74 and 132 gigawatts by 2028, or 6.7% to 12% of the total electricity consumption in the country. A large number of power companies are already ramping up their capacity to meet this growing power demand. It is forecasted that US electricity demand will grow 55% over the next 20 years, six times faster than the 9% growth witnessed over the past two decades.\n\nAccording to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade to meet this growing demand. However, the price of natural gas has surged by over 140% over the last year and the costs for gas power plants have also soared in the last 18 months. If the US concentrates only on gas, it will become even more expensive, forcing up bills for consumers and businesses.\n\nNuclear energy has also received a massive boost in recent years, largely driven by its widespread recognition of its role in the global \u2018clean energy transition\u2019. The International Energy Agency recently revealed that nuclear is set to generate a record level of electricity this year. There are more than 70 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity under construction around the world, one of the highest levels in the last 30 years. Moreover, on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference earlier this month, several major corporations have signed a pledge to support the goal of at least tripling the world\u2019s nuclear energy capacity by 2050.\n\nDespite the best efforts by the incumbent Trump administration to hamper its progress, the clean-energy industry is on pace for record growth this year. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the share of new power capacity that is expected to come online this year from renewables and batteries will jump to 93%.\n\nThe promising future prospects of the energy industry can also be reaffirmed by the growing interest of billionaire investors, who have significantly raised their stakes in the sector. Even Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway acquired an additional 763,017 shares of an oil and gas giant in Q4 2024, despite the ongoing issues faced by the industry. But while Buffett\u2019s portfolio leans heavily on oil and gas, Berkshire Hathaway Energy operates one of the largest renewable energy portfolios in the US and has invested over $40 billion in wind, solar, and hydroelectric projects.\n\nWith that said, here are the Billionaires\u2019 Favorite Energy Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and picked the top 12 companies operating in the energy sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in Q4 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of billionaires backing them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Energy Stocks According to Billionaires.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Holders: 16\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is the largest independent exploration and production company in the world, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has transformed itself into a low-cost oil producer by selling its higher-cost oil assets and recycling that capital into acquiring lower-cost resources. The company capped off this transformation with the $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil last year, which added high-quality, low-cost supply inventory to its portfolio. As a result, COP now has over 20 billion barrels of resources with an average cost of supply at $32 per barrel.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) outperformed expectations in Q4 2024 as its adjusted EPS of $1.98 was above estimates by $0.15. The company\u2019s revenue of $14.74 billion, though down 3.72% YoY, still topped consensus by almost $515 million. COP also generated $20.3 billion in cash from operations in 2024 and announced an ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share for Q1 of 2025. ConocoPhillips has grown its dividend for 10 consecutive years and wants to pursue a more aggressive shareholder return policy in 2025, with planned returns of $10 billion, including $6 billion in buybacks.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has an annual dividend yield of 3.06% as of March 22, 2024, putting it among the 13 Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 6th on our list of the best energy stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for COP, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

China is widely considered the largest purchaser of Venezuelan crude, though much of the oil arrives through indirect routes or intermediaries that obscure its origin to sidestep international sanctions.\n\nBeyond geopolitics, U.S. economic data on Monday gave oil another push. Business activity surveys in March came in stronger than expected, easing recession fears but raising concerns that input costs may be accelerating again.\n\nUS Energy Stock Reactions\n\nThe oil rally ignited gains across the energy sector. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM rose 1.1% to $116.75 by 11:15 a.m. in New York, reaching its highest level price since early December. Chevron Corp. CVX added 0.4%, while ConocoPhillips COP gained 0.6%.\n\nThe Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE climbed 0.6%, extending its year-to-date gain to 7.8%\u2014the best performance among all S&P 500 sectors in 2025.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Most Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStock prices took a steep hit in March as investors grew concerned about a possible economic downturn, driven by unpredictable tariff policies and signs of slowing job growth. The broader market has dropped over 7% from its peak on February 19, putting stocks on the doorstep of a correction.\n\nA group of seasoned investors saw last week\u2019s stock market downturn as a buying opportunity. As the market briefly entered correction territory, wiping out approximately $5 trillion from the broader market\u2019s value, corporate insiders began increasing their purchases. According to data from the Washington Service, the insider sentiment index climbed to 0.46 in March, up from 0.31 in January, with almost two weeks still remaining in the month. This puts the metric on track for its highest monthly level since June, bringing it closer to its historical norm.\n\nDave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, made the following comment about the situation:\n\n\u201cIf we see corporate insiders begin to use the opportunity in their stock prices to purchase shares, that shows that they have confidence in the underlying economy and in their underlying businesses. That differs from just the headlines, because the headlines are scary.\u201d\n\nIn its 2025 US Market Outlook, Morningstar indicated that the US stock market was approaching the upper limit of its fair value range, suggesting that investors should moderate their return expectations for the year. It was noted that, since the end of 2010, the market had traded at such a premium or higher less than 10% of the time. Given these conditions, the firm had adopted a more cautious stance, emphasizing the increasing importance of portfolio positioning.\n\nMorningstar advised investors to overweight value stocks and underweight growth stocks, citing that growth stocks were trading at their highest premium relative to fair value since the tech-driven bubble in early 2021, whereas value stocks remained undervalued. As of March 3, 2025, the Morningstar Value Index had gained 5.54% year to date, while the Morningstar Growth Index had declined 3.81%.\n\nIn addition, investors are shifting capital into value funds, which are perceived as more resilient during market downturns compared to growth stocks. Data from Lipper shows that U.S. growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $3.6 billion in outflows this month, while U.S. value ETFs attracted $1.8 billion in inflows. Value funds, which are largely composed of stocks from sectors like banking, energy, and utilities, provide a cushion against market volatility by focusing on stable, cash-rich, and undervalued companies that tend to be less sensitive to economic swings.\n\nChris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value funds at Gabelli Funds, noted that value stocks present an appealing opportunity, especially among small and mid-cap companies. He highlighted that these firms tend to gain more from deregulation and tax cuts while being less impacted by challenges like tariffs. Given this, we will take a look at the most undervalued stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 20. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected seven companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 20: 11.46\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a Texas-based global energy company that is engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production. The company has recently focused on improving operational efficiency and expanding its LNG business. Its strong performance has been driven by disciplined cost management, successful integration of acquisitions, and progress in low-carbon technologies. In recognition of its sustainability efforts, the company received the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard in 2024, underscoring its commitment to lowering emissions.\n\nAs a company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) experienced a notable increase in output during the fourth quarter of 2024. Production rose 14.8% year-over-year to 2,183 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), largely due to strategic acquisitions, including the completion of its Marathon Oil acquisition in November 2024. The stock has a forward P/E multiple of 11x, which makes it one of the most undervalued stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) maintained a strong position, generating $20.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year, with total cash from operations reaching $20.3 billion. Shareholder returns remained a priority, with $3.6 billion distributed through dividends. Following a 34% increase in October, the company\u2019s quarterly dividend now stands at $0.78 per share. Its dividend yield comes in at 3.05%, as of March 20. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 10 years.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 4th on our list of most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Uncertainty over the economy and tariff wars have been fueling volatility in the stock market, but dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some stability.\n\nInvestors looking for stable income in this shaky backdrop can consider adding stocks of dividend-paying companies to their portfolios. To that end, the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors who are on the hunt for the right names.\n\nHere are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nVitesse Energy\n\nThis week's first dividend pick is Vitesse Energy (VTS), a unique energy company that owns financial interests, mainly as a non-operator, in oil and gas wells drilled by leading U.S. operators. Earlier this month, Vitesse completed the acquisition of Lucero Energy. The company expects this deal to increase dividends and provide additional liquidity to bolster its ability to make accretive acquisitions.\n\nRecently, Vitesse announced its fourth-quarter results and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5625 per share, payable on March 31. This payment marks a 7% rise from the prior quarter. VTS stock offers a dividend yield of 9.3%.\n\nFollowing the Q4 print, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne reiterated a buy rating on VTS stock with a price target of $33. The analyst noted that the Q4 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) modestly lagged the consensus estimate due to marginally lower-than-expected production and the one-time costs related to the Lucero acquisition.\n\nByrne noted the planned increase in Vitesse's dividend following the completion of the Lucero acquisition. The analyst stated that increasing the dividend is consistent with VTS' strategy of raising its payout as the expected operating cash flow grows. He added that management aims to keep the dividend coverage ratio at about 1.0x.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the Lucero deal adds to the company's operated production in the Bakken and nearly 25 net locations, which Vitesse believes equates to about 10 years of inventory life. Byrne views the Lucero deal positively, as it is accretive to Vitesse's earnings, dividend, free cash flow, and net asset value.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area\u2019s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.\n\n\"While the deal is a departure from VTS's non-op strategy, adding an operated leg gives VTS incremental control over its capital and potential additional deal flow,\" said Byrne.\n\nByrne ranks No. 166 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 54% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.1%. See Vitesse Energy Stock Charts on TipRanks.\n\nViper Energy\n\nWe move to Viper Energy (VNOM), an oil and gas company that is a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG). Viper was formed by Diamondback to own, acquire, and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America. It is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, mainly the Permian Basin.\n\nThe company announced a base cash dividend of 30 cents per share and a variable cash dividend of 35 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The total Q4 2024 capital return of 65 cents per share represents 75% of the cash available for distribution.\n\nRecently, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock but lowered the price target to $51 from $56 as part of an update to his firm's exploration and production models. The update reflected natural gas supply-demand analysis, stronger than expected LNG (liquified natural gas) demand-pull and the possibility of further decline in oil prices. The decline would be due to the combination of record U.S. oil supply, the return of OPEC+ barrels in April and global trade risk amid tariffs.\n\nExplaining his bullish stance on VNOM stock, Jayaram said that mineral companies like Viper own the perpetual royalty interests under oil and gas leasehold, which gives them exposure to growth with no capital or operating expenses.\n\nThe analyst highlighted Viper's policy of returning about 75% of all distributable cash flow to shareholders through base and variable dividends and share buybacks. Jayaram thinks that Viper is unique due to its relationship with Diamondback Energy. Notably, Diamondback operates a major portion of Viper's acreage, which gives visibility and reduces a key uncertainty that is usually associated with companies in the minerals space.\n\n\"In Viper's case, between EBITDA growth and FCF yield, we see an attractive total return proposition,\" the analyst said.\n\nJayaram ranks No. 677 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.3%. See Viper Energy Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nJayaram is also bullish on ConocoPhillips (COP) and reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target to $115 from $127 as part of his update to his firm's exploration and production models. As mentioned above, the analyst is concerned about the possibility of a further decline in oil prices. ConocoPhillips announced a dividend of 78 cents a share for Q1 2025. COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nThe analyst said that since ConocoPhillips' 2016 strategy reset, the company has been one of the best exploration and production players. Jayaram noted multiple counter-cyclical transactions executed by COP that have lowered its cost of supply and significantly enhanced the durability of the company's \"Lower 48\" inventory, bolstering its balance sheet and portfolio optionality to LNG.\n\nJayaram added that on a normalized basis, ConocoPhillips' corporate break-even would be at the low-end of the peer group, given that it has much lower sustaining capital requirements than its peers. However, the combination of the company's long-cycle investments like Willow and Port Arthur, as well as the Marathon Oil merger, have modestly increased the oil beta of COP stock.\n\nHe expects ConocoPhillips to be one the few exploration and production companies in JPMorgan's coverage that could increase their cash return in 2025, including stock buybacks of $6 billion.\n\n\"We view COP as a core E&P holding given its portfolio strength, inventory durability, and shareholder friendly cash return framework,\" said Jayaram.

They also discussed dozens of climate lawsuits filed by state and local governments against companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and others.\n\nTrump appeared to agree with the industry's position, noting that state actions could undermine his agenda for \"energy dominance.\" The president said he would consider measures the administration could take to support the oil industry. The meeting was attended by executives from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Hess.\n\nThe publication notes that oil industry representatives have invested tens of millions of dollars in Trump's campaign, hoping that he will ensure long-term demand for their products. While the first weeks of his presidency have raised concerns among fracking companies, Trump has already begun to heed their demands, repealing environmental regulations, opening more land for drilling and encouraging increased natural gas exports. Now the industry is seeking to draw the administration's attention to its legal problems as it faces growing threats.",

Over the last quarter, ConocoPhillips's share price increased by 6.5%, during a period where broader market indices exhibited mixed performance amid economic uncertainties. Key drivers of the price move likely include a strong buyback program, with nearly 18.4 million shares repurchased, and a solid ordinary dividend declared at $0.78 per share. The company's Q4 earnings showed declines compared to the previous year, but production levels improved with a notable increase in barrels of oil equivalent per day. These developments occurred as the market experienced an 8.1% growth over the past 12 months. This context highlights ConocoPhillips's ability to navigate its strategic landscape amidst broader market challenges.\n\nNYSE:COP Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nConocoPhillips has delivered substantial total shareholder returns of 280.48% over the past five years. This impressive performance, despite recent underperformance against the US Oil and Gas industry and broader market over the past year, can be attributed to several key factors. The company's earnings have grown significantly, with an average annual increase of 27.1%, underlining its strong financial performance. The share repurchase program has been another major factor, enhancing shareholder returns with 432.58 million shares repurchased since November 2016, totaling over US$34.27 billion.\n\nMoreover, consistent dividend payments have bolstered returns, with recent affirmations of ordinary dividends at US$0.78 per share. While earnings in 2024 faced some declines, strong production levels offered stability. The company also engaged with environmental concerns, having advised against a shareholder proposal to remove emissions targets, reflecting its commitment to sustainable practices amidst investor scrutiny.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The backdrop for the meeting, however, was mounting concern about the president\u2019s plan to slash energy prices, potentially to levels that could make some domestic production unprofitable. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, closed at $67.16 per barrel, down from $75.89 Trump\u2019s first full day in the White House this year.\n\nStill, in the meeting, \u201cthere was really no discussion on price,\u201d Burgum said, emphasizing that\u2019s \u201cset by supply and demand,\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can say in that room that would change that one iota.\u201d\n\nInstead, the group focused heavily on the need to speed up permitting times and ensure project approvals have lasting durability. While some moves to streamline permitting can be achieved administratively by the executive branch, oil industry leaders have emphasized the importance of getting those changes passed by Congress and enshrined into law.\n\n\u201cWe did talk a lot about permitting, because one of the things that this industry has faced is the onslaught of regulation that really had one goal in mind: trying to drive their business out of business,\u201d Burgum said. In story after story, Burgum said he and Energy Secretary Chris Wright heard how \u201cthe permitting process takes longer than the actual building process on critical infrastructure in our country.\u201d\n\nAhead of the meeting, participants were set to include chief executives from across the spectrum of the industry, including integrated oil companies (Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Plc, bp Plc, ConocoPhillips, Hess Corp.); independent producers (Diamondback Energy Inc., APA Corp\u2019s Apache, Occidental Petroleum Corp., Continental Resources Inc.); refiners (Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66); a pipeline operator (Enbridge Inc.) and an oil field service firm (Baker Hughes Co.). A final participant list was not immediately available Wednesday afternoon.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright dismissed talk of a possible $50 price target for crude. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve mentioned $50 oil before,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said all commodities are supply and demand.\u201d However, Wright added, the federal government can \u201cdo everything we can to get barriers out of the way to grow supply,\u201d which will naturally push prices down.\n\nThat\u2019s already happening, Wright said, as the Trump administration embarks on a deregulation agenda that could enhance demand for fossil fuels while lowering the cost of producing oil and natural gas. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen prices come down a little bit already in anticipation that it\u2019s going to be easier to produce energy in the United States and it\u2019s going to be lower risk.\u201d",

The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.04, reflecting a 0.49% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $16.34 billion, up 12.89% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.05 per share and revenue of $64.6 billion.

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

            "content": "EIA forecasts Alaska crude oil production will grow in 2026 for the first time since 2017\n\nIn its March 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast crude oil production in Alaska will increase by 16,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2026 to 438,000 bpd after remaining relatively flat in 2025. Two new oil developments in Alaska \u2014 the Nuna and Pikka projects \u2014 are expected to boost crude oil production in the state after decades of decline. If realized, this annual production increase will be the first since 2017 and the largest since 2002.\n\nAverage annual crude oil production in Alaska peaked at 2.0 million bpd in 1988, and production has since fallen largely because of the production decline of mature oil fields, limited lease availability, and high exploration and production costs.\n\nConocoPhillips produced first oil from the Nuna project in December 2024. We forecast annual crude oil production in Alaska to average 422,000 bpd in 2025, an annual increase of 1,000 bpd, compared with the previous five-year (2020\u201324) average annual decline of 9,000 b/d. The decline in existing well production is offset by the added production from the Nuna project on the North Slope. ConocoPhillips expects the Nuna project\u2019s 29 wells will produce a combined 20,000 bpd of oil at its peak.\n\nAdditional production from Phase 1 of the Pikka development project on the North Slope drives the forecast increased production in 2026. The Pikka project, which is jointly owned by Santos and Repsol, is one of the most significant oil developments in Alaska in recent years. At the project\u2019s peak, the companies plan to produce 80,000 bpd from 45 wells.\n\nThe projects would be among the most productive wells in Alaska if they come online as the companies are currently planning. EIA's annual U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Wells by Production Rate report details state-level distributions of active production. The production profile for Alaska in 2023 records 2,340 active wells, 65% of which produce more than 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed).\n\nThe production estimates from the Nuna and Pikka wells reported by the companies fall on the high side of the 2023 Alaskan active well distribution. As of 2023, the highest concentration of active Alaskan wells was between 100 boed and 200 boed. The reported production rates show these upcoming projects to be at the production brackets of 400 boed\u2013799 boed and 1,600 boed\u20133,199 boed, respectively.\n\nAlthough both onshore and offshore drilling occur in Alaska, most of the activity is on land, particularly in the North Slope, which is where the Nuna and Pikka projects are being developed.\n\nAs of December 2024, 22% of the wells for the Nuna and Pikka projects have been drilled, according to company reports and the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. The companies plan to drill an additional 58 wells by 2028, which would support relatively high rig activity.\n\nThe increased crude oil production will go to supply refineries in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and California.\n\nHeader image: ConocoPhillip's Nuna project achieved first oil in December 2024.

In its recent fourth quarter results, BP said its BPX division, which operates in the Eagle Ford, reports that refracs were now creating more flow than the original motherbores, contributing to triple-digit plus returns in the region.\n\nNatural gas shift in the Eagle Ford\n\nOver the past decade, a depletion in prime drilling locations led to a reduction in new wells being drilled.\n\nEagle Ford lateral well lengths are typically shorter than those in the Permian Basin and other regions due to geological and operational factors. Heavy faulting and varying reservoir pressures can make long laterals more challenging. In the Permian, Delaware and Bakken/Williston basins, companies frequently drill wells with lateral lengths of up to and over 10,000 feet, while lateral lengths in the Eagle Ford average closer to 7,500 feet.\n\nRecent data suggests break-even prices are slightly higher in the Eagle Ford than in other U.S. shale regions, raising the possibility that diminishing returns may set in sooner than in other regions due to the formation\u2019s characteristics, despite increased production efficiency.\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests this has not started yet. For example, BP\u2019s BPX still expects triple digit returns for now and ConocoPhillips notes its Eagle Ford wells are still competitive.\n\n\u201cWe're looking at the current well performance\u2026. Eagle Ford looks very strong,\u201d said Nick Olds, EVP, Lower 48, ConocoPhillips.\n\nNatural gas prices at the Eagle Ford shale \u2014 as measured at the Katy or Houston Ship Channel (HSC) hub \u2014 tend to have a narrower differential to Henry Hub prices than Waha hub prices in the Permian, largely due to pipeline capacity.\n\nThis has led companies such as Crescent Energy to boost gas-focused drilling in the Eagle Ford in recent quarters.\n\n\u201cOur Eagle Ford position is cored up across oil, and what we call a mixed area and then into dry gas\u2026there is a little bit more gas drilling in the portfolio this year off stronger gas prices,\u201d said David Rockecharlie, CEO, Crescent Energy.\n\nResearch by natural resource investors Goehring and Rozencwajg suggests shales are approaching a slowdown driven by depletion, rather than price or regulation, meaning higher prices may struggle to incentivize increased production. The researchers note that in the 1970s an increase in drilling in conventional oil and gas plays did not lead to an increase in production for a similar reason.\n\nM&A can help firms consolidate resources and face this potential depletion issue with an improved portfolio of inventory and better drilling techniques because of pooled knowledge. ConocoPhillips\u2019s acquisition of Marathon in 2024 gives the company control of the latter\u2019s wells, the bulk of which were in the Eagle Ford.\n\nSource: ConocoPhillips Investor Presentation, May 29, 2024. Available via EE Documents\n\nThe company plans to reduce the combined ConocoPhillips and Marathon capex spend in the Eagle Ford and Bakken by over $500 million in 2025 while maintaining flat production levels.\n\n\u201cWe're confident in our ability to achieve an optimal plateau level at lower levels of activities versus stand-alone companies. Or, simply put, we need fewer rigs and fewer frac crews to achieve the same outcome,\u201d said Andy O\u2019Brien, SVP of Strategy at ConocoPhillips.\n\nCrescent Energy has realized synergies in excess of $100 million following its acquisition of SilverBow Resources in the Eagle Ford. It hopes for further value creation following five acquisitions announced in 2024, including a $905 million Ridgemar Energy acquisition, that combine to double the size of its Eagle Ford footprint.\n\nSource: Crescent Energy Investor Presentation, December 3, 2024.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other profitable value stocks to buy now.\n\nMatt Powers, Managing Partner at Powers Advisory Group, joined the discussion on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Power Lunch\u2019 on March 11 to provide insights into the shift from growth to value investing and the resurgence of traditional dividend strategies. Powers emphasized that this transition has become increasingly evident, particularly following last week\u2019s market activity and the events of March 10. He noted that while the market behavior on March 11 might tell a slightly different story, the broader trend is unmistakable. For years, growth stocks dominated portfolios, but now investors are gravitating toward value and dividend investing, which had been largely overlooked for over a decade. Powers attributed this shift to various catalysts, which included tariffs and policy uncertainty from Washington and President Trump\u2019s unpredictable stances. He described investors as exhausted, and welcomed the normalization of equity markets and a return to diversification and traditional investing.\n\nPowers highlighted the importance of diversification, contrasting high-growth portfolios with those focused on dividends. He pointed out that ETFs have outperformed large-cap growth funds year-to-date, with a notable 11-point difference in returns. The dividend fund is up 5%, while the large-cap growth fund is down 6%. He explained that tech stocks dominate large-cap growth funds and account for nearly half of their portfolios. In contrast, dividend-focused funds are more diversified across sectors such as healthcare, financials, and staples. This diversification reduces concentration risk and provides defensive characteristics in an uncertain market environment. Powers elaborated on the leadership shift between these two types of funds. While growth ETFs feature holdings like the MAG7, dividend ETFs focus on blue-chip companies. A year ago, growth stocks were investor favorites, but now value stocks are taking the lead, which is a trend reflected in their performance. He stressed the importance of broadening diversification within portfolios and not ignoring value opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15.

Every day, employees, retirees and family members enjoy the center's state-of-the-art equipment, personal training, and in-person and virtual classes, taking advantage of one of the many ways the company fosters an inclusive environment.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday afternoons, Cameron Kocurek, the son of Principal Engineer Chris Kocurek, works out with personal trainer Nathan Kennedy. In 2024, at the age of 19, Cameron, who has Down syndrome, began a remarkable journey to fitness. It started when Cameron observed his parents working out with their personal trainer. A few years earlier, Chris and his wife Melissa started a program to improve their fitness and brought their youngest son along to the gym for their weekly sessions.\n\nNate leads Cameron through a Tuesday afternoon workout at the Houston Wellness Center.\n\n\u201cHe was sitting there watching mom and dad get healthy and strong and he was inspired,\u201d Chris said. \u201cHe wanted to join but insisted on having his own trainer.\u201d\n\nThis was a pivotal moment for the family. They approached the Wellness Center staff to discuss Cameron\u2019s special needs, and to their delight, they found Nathan, a trainer who had a passion for working with individuals with disabilities. Nathan had worked with Special Olympics powerlifters since 2013, and was still working with his very first client, who broke the Texas state deadlift record in his weight class in 2017.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was excited to work with Cameron!\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI had lifted with him before and was already impressed by his strength.\u201d\n\nCameron has been equally excited to work with Nathan, and interact with several Wellness Center regulars, who invite him to join their sets.\n\n\"I enjoy the challenging workouts with Nate and my gym friends, especially doing dips and bench press,\u201d he said. \u201cNathan has helped me to develop perfect form, and I love seeing my muscles grow. It feels powerful and fun.\"\n\nCameron hones his deadlift skills with Nathan's guidance.\n\nCameron\u2019s progress has been nothing short of extraordinary. The sessions increased Cameron\u2019s physical strength and significantly improved his core stability and motor skills. These gains are crucial for individuals with Down syndrome, who typically have reduced muscle tone and impaired coordination.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made great progress especially in refining his technique and form to ensure longevity in his training,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he soon competes at a high level or even breaks Texas records.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of Cameron\u2019s journey extend well beyond physical fitness.\n\nNate supervises as Cameron does dips, an effective exercise for building upper body strength.\n\n\u201cCameron\u2019s confidence and independence have grown immensely,\u201d Chris said.\n\nThis growth marks significant steps toward the goal of Cameron living independently in the future.\n\nInclusivity, a key element of ConocoPhillips\u2019 culture, led to the creation in 2020 of the ABLE (A Better Life for Everyone) Employee Resource Group (ERG) to support those with disabilities and their families.\n\n\u201cWe established ABLE to help people with disabilities or who have loved ones with disabilities connect, share experiences and raise awareness across the employee base,\" said Staff Geoscientist and ABLE co-founder Jennifer Hoyt. \"I am so proud of our fitness center for taking extra steps to make people with disabilities feel seen and welcome.\"\n\nTo strengthen his upper body, Cameron performs pull-ups.\n\nThe ABLE ERG provides a platform for families to share resources and advice, helping each other navigate the complexities of raising children with special needs. As a member, for example, Chris compiled a list of high schools and colleges with programs for students with disabilities that he shares with other parents.\n\nSupport from ABLE and the inclusive culture at ConocoPhillips have been instrumental in Cameron\u2019s development. His story is a testament to the power of community support and the importance of inclusive environments.\n\n\u201cIt has inspired many of our colleagues and led to increased awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and their families,\u201d Jennifer said.\n\nCameron attended The Arbor School and The Tuttle School for eight years each, graduating from a high school equivalent program. Now in a transition program at Briarwood/Tuttle, he gains customer service experience at the caf\u00e9, assists as a physical education coach, and participates in Special Olympics programs. He also works at Lakeside Country Club and Brookwood Community, while being active in Showcase Gymnastics, Young Life Capernaum and Grace Fellowship Katy Bridge Special Needs church. Despite his busy schedule, the family reserves Monday or Tuesday evenings for family time.\n\nCameron dedicates his Tuesday afternoons to training at the Houston Wellness Center.\n\nBradley, Cameron's older brother, is a Chemical Engineering senior at Texas Tech University, and Sosina, his older sister, is a Civil Engineering senior at the University of Houston. Cameron looks up to Bradley and aspires to follow in his footsteps, including going to college. Sosina, who is adopted from Ethiopia, was quickly embraced by Cameron as his sister. The siblings are aware of their unique family dynamics and are supportive of Cameron while preparing for their own futures.\n\nCameron and Chris refine their weight-lifting forms under Nate's expert guidance.\n\n\u201cMelissa and I strive to allow them to mature independently,\u201d Chris said, \u201crecognizing that they will play a significant role in Cameron's life in the years to come.\u201d\n\nChris and Melissa have big dreams for Cameron. They hope his passion for fitness will continue to grow. \u201cHe might even compete in Special Olympics weightlifting events in the future,\u201d Chris said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoons, as Cameron works out with Nathan at the ConocoPhillips Wellness Center, his resolve to keep going is fueled by the unwavering support of his family, the staff and the broader ConocoPhillips community. Together, they are building a brighter, more inclusive future, one workout at a time.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWorld Down Syndrome Day is celebrated on March 21st every year. The day raises awareness of Down syndrome and is part of Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. The 21st day of March was chosen to represent the unique triplication of the 21st chromosome, which causes Down syndrome.",

Hollingshead \u2013 coming off MVP honors at last week's GNAC Tournament \u2013 scored three early baskets to help draw things even, andsank two midrange jumpers to claim a 19-14 lead after one quarter.The Seawolves dominated the rest of the half behind the play of Rean and Evans, who combined for 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting in the second quarter, with Evans's last-second baseline floater forging a 39-24 lead at the break.Hollingshead converted one of's six steals into a basket midway through the third quarter to push UAA's largest advantage to 47-31, but the Yellowjackets began to find their offensive rhythm, using threes from Giese and Chloe Williams to make it 53-43 heading into the final period.Rean made four straight free throws as the Seawolves maintained at least an eight-point lead throughout the fourth quarter, and Evans sank a free throw for a seemingly insurmountable 67-55 lead with 62 seconds remaining.Billings reserve guard Layla Baumann nailed a trey with 47 seconds left, however, and she and Boyce nabbed back-to-back steals for two quick layups, giving the GNAC regular-season runners-up a 7-0 run in 13 seconds.Baumann answered a Hollingshead free throw with another three-pointer to slice it to a one-possession game, and Evans converted one of two free throws for UAA with 17 seconds left to make it 69-65. The Seawolf defense didn't allow a quick shot, but Williams drew a shooting foul with 2.7 seconds showing. With both teams out of timeouts, Williams made the first and purposely missed the second, allowing Boyce to sneak in for an offensive rebound. Boyce fired to Giese \u2013 a 42 percent three-point shooter \u2013 for the tying attempt, which rattled off both sides of the rim before popping out at the buzzer.Hollingshead shot 13 of 20 from the field as the first-team all-region and all-conference performer added 10 rebounds for her 12th double-double. The Orem, Utah, native also recorded all three of her blocked shots in the late going to help preserve the victory.Rean, a 6-2 freshman from New Zealand, shot 6 of 9 from the field, along with nine rebounds and five assists.Long and Gamble tallied six points apiece, with Long adding three assists.\"It definitely felt more intense because we knew that if we didn't win we're just done for, but I think every game we always have really high energy, and we approach it the same,\" said Rean. \"We know that if we do what we do, we're going to be OK.\"Saturday's UAA-CSUDH game pits the GNAC regular-season and tournament champions against the California Collegiate Athletic Association regular-season and tourney champs, with the winner facing either No. 6 seed Central Washington or No. 7 seed Chico State in Monday's 6 p.m. ADT regional title game.

These deals have increased its scale and low-cost resources, enabling it to produce more excess cash to return to shareholders.\n\nThat strategy has paid off for those who invested in the oil stock five years ago. Here's a look at what a $10,000 investment made in early 2020 would be worth today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe path since the pandemic\n\n2020 was a rough year for everyone. It was especially challenging for the oil patch because economic shutdowns caused demand to dry up. At one point, crude prices in the U.S. crashed into negative territory.\n\nHowever, those brave enough to bet big on ConocoPhillips during those dark days have made a lot of money:\n\nAs that chart shows, a $10,000 investment made into ConocoPhillips during the early days of the pandemic would have grown to over $29,500. Meanwhile, the total return would be even higher for those who reinvested their dividends. That's much more than you could have earned by parking that money in an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nSeveral factors helped fuel those high-octane total returns, including recovering oil prices, acquisitions, and rising shareholder returns. Acquisitions have played a key role in accelerating ConocoPhillips' growth and ability to return cash to investors. The company made a bold pandemic-era strike by acquiring Concho Resources in a $9.7 billion all-stock deal in late 2020 to bolster its presence in the oil-rich Permian Basin. It followed that up a year later by acquiring Shell's Permian assets for $9.5 billion. Those deals helped grow its production and cash flow.\n\nConocoPhillips recently completed its biggest deal, buying Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion. That acquisition should fuel continued cash flow growth in the coming years. It positions the oil giant to buy back a boatload of its stock while continuing to deliver high-octane dividend growth. Because of that, it should have plenty of fuel to continue growing shareholder value over the next five years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "Equatorial Guinea has launched a comprehensive initiative to address declining gas production and maximize its untapped hydrocarbon reserves. The strategy aims to drive economic growth and enhance market stability through investment-friendly policies, new drilling campaigns and fiscal reforms.\n\nSpeaking at the Strategic Roundtable on Africa during this year\u2019s CERAWeek in Houston, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons Antonio Oburu Ondo emphasized Equatorial Guinea\u2019s renewed focus on exploration as the key to reversing production declines. The government has approved new fiscal terms to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness, with additional production-sharing contract revisions expected by next year.\n\n\u201cWe expect an increase in market participation as the new regulations come into effect,\u201d said Minister Oburu Ondo.\n\nEquatorial Guinea\u2019s open-door policy continues to attract investors, with eight new contracts signed in recent months. Global energy firms, including ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Trident Energy and Africa Oil Corp., are among those expected to expand their presence. To further encourage investment, the government is streamlining access to hydrocarbon data, implementing a new multi-client data strategy by the end of the year to ensure timely access for interested investors. A new licensing round is also set to launch before year-end, offering fresh opportunities for international investors.\n\nAddressing industry challenges, Equatorial Guinea is working to ease banking restrictions imposed by the Bank of Central African States, with plans to implement exceptions for major operators and service companies where necessary, according to the Minister.\n\nThe country is also advancing its Gas Mega Hub initiative to solidify its role as a key gas supplier in Africa. Equatorial Guinea is prioritizing partnerships with Cameroon and Nigeria to monetize gas from fields such as the Aseng Field within its waters. Negotiations are underway with both countries, as well as operators like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, to secure gas supplies for liquefaction plants. Development plans for Block EG-27 are progressing, reinforcing Equatorial Guinea\u2019s position in the regional energy market.\n\n\u201cGas is not only a transition fuel for us \u2013 it will also be energy for the future,\u201d said Minister Oburu Ondo, highlighting the country\u2019s long-term commitment to hydrocarbon development. To that end, Equatorial Guinea remains engaged in securing gas supplies from both domestic fields and neighboring countries, ensuring continued LNG production and exports.\n\nEfforts by Equatorial Guinea to enhance its hydrocarbons sector and the vast lucrative opportunities within the country will be further showcased during the upcoming African Energy Week (AEW): Invest in African Energies. The event will feature Equatorial Guinea\u2019s regulatory authorities, key project operators and global investors on deal signings and partnership formation.\n\nAEW: Invest in African Energies is the platform of choice for project operators, financiers, technology providers and government, and has emerged as the official place to sign deals in African energy.

            "content": "Forget March coming in like a lion -- this month has come in more like a bear. While the S&P 500 had climbed about 1.2% through the first two months of 2025, the index has been heading south since peaking on Feb. 19.\n\nFor patient investors willing and able to ride out some near-term volatility -- and who want to collect some passive income while doing so -- now is a great time to act. As energy prices have dipped over the past year (West Texas Intermediate crude oil is down 14.3%), investors should head for the oil patch.\n\nHere they can pick up shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.41%), ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%), with their forward dividend yields of 2.1% and 3.5%, respectively, along with Devon Energy (DVN -2.76%) and its 2.8% forward dividend yield.\n\n1. Occidental Petroleum (down 22.7%)\n\nThose familiar with the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio will likely recognize Occidental Petroleum. The conglomerate first purchased shares of the integrated energy company in 2019, and today, it's the sixth-largest position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Since Warren Buffett, an ardent believer in long-term investing horizons, has given the green light to Occidental Petroleum, it's certainly worth Main Street investors' time to drill down into and understand.\n\nThe stock's recent decline belies the company's strong performance in 2024. Occidental Petroleum set a company record for its annual U.S. oil production thanks to strong performances from assets in the Delaware, DJ, Midland, and Powder River basins. And with its acquisition of CrownRock complete, it has an even more formidable presence in the Midland Basin. It also strengthened its balance sheet by repaying $4.5 billion in near-term debt -- seven months ahead of schedule, no less.\n\nWith a stronger financial position and a more robust portfolio, Occidental Petroleum should successfully weather this downturn in energy prices.\n\n2. ConocoPhillips (down 19.2%)\n\nOil supermajor ConocoPhillips warrants attention as a high-yield stock. Couple that with the stock's attractive price tag -- shares are valued at 5.2 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 6.2 -- and it becomes even more enticing.\n\nConocoPhillips has fortified its portfolio with the $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil it completed in November. Among the benefits it gained from that deal were the addition of more than 2 billion barrels of low-cost resources and more than $1 billion in synergies that it will recognize in 2025.\n\nAnother auspicious development for the company in 2024 was that it grew its reserves. Between exploration activities, the Marathon Oil acquisition, and other factors, ConocoPhillips ended 2024 with reserves of 7.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to 6.8 billion BOE at the end of 2023.\n\nConocoPhillips frequently generates free cash flow per share that exceeds the amount it distributes in dividends, showing how management is unwilling to jeopardize the company's financial health to appease shareholders. In fact, on the company's fourth-quarter 2024 conference call, management reaffirmed its conservative approach to rewarding shareholders by noting that it was only committed to returning at least 30% of operating cash flow to investors -- though in 2024, it returned 45%.\n\n3. Devon Energy (down 23.2%)\n\nDon't let Devon Energy's poor stock performance fool you. While its shares have plunged over the past year, the upstream company has had much to celebrate. One notable feat was that it increased its oil production to an impressive new high water mark.\n\nDevon reported a record of 398,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, thanks in part to its acquisition of Grayson Mill. This, in addition to its strong natural gas production, contributed to the company extracting a record 737,000 BOE daily in 2024. And the strong performance is expected to continue. Management projects production of 805,000 BOE to 825,000 BOE in 2025.\n\nGenerating strong free cash flow -- $3 billion in 2024 -- Devon Energy had ample resources to both strengthen its financial position and reward shareholders. The company returned $2 billion to shareholders and repaid $472 million in debt.\n\nDevon has based its dividend payments on a fixed amount plus a variable amount (which is based on the company's financial performance); however, management has prioritized share buybacks instead of a substantial variable dividend recently. Nonetheless, management specified on the Q3 2024 conference call:\n\nThe variable dividend will remain a tool within our cash return framework, but in the near term, we expect to deliver cash returns to shareholders through our fixed dividend and share repurchase program.\n\nIn the coming years, management plans more of the same. After allocating 30% of free cash flow toward strengthening the balance sheet, Devon Energy plans to return up to 70% of free cash flow to shareholders.\n\nNow's the time to gas up on these energy stocks\n\nThe price of oil has fallen during the past year, which dragged energy stocks lower, but savvy investors know that energy prices are cyclical. As such, when energy prices sink, it can often create great opportunities to pick up leading energy stocks at discounted prices.\n\nFor conservative investors who are interested in S&P 500 energy stocks that have fallen out of favor, Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips would be smart candidates to consider, while those looking for growth potential will want to fuel up their portfolios with shares of Devon Energy.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire\u2019s 15 Favorite Oil and Gas Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other billionaire\u2019s favorite oil and gas stocks right now.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant driver of the global economy, influencing industries, transportation, and geopolitical dynamics. However, the past year has been nothing short of a roller coaster for the sector, with high volatility coming from factors such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and a dampening demand due to a global economic slowdown.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now\n\nBrent crude prices have recently hit a 6-month low as US crude oil stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected build, coupled with worries about a looming return of more OPEC+ barrels to the market and President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The global oil and gas majors have already struggled with decreasing prices in 2024 and the recent decline has only added to their troubles. Things could get even worse, as the IEA expects Brent crude prices to fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, as the US oil and gas production hits record highs, President Trump has made calls to \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d and pump those numbers up even higher, as he seeks to make the country self-sufficient in energy. However, not everyone seems to be on. Instead of continuously increasing supply and hence plunging prices even lower, the oil industry remains focused on achieving efficiency gains and maintaining capital discipline, while also rewarding loyal shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the natural gas sector. US gas producers, which curbed production last year due to multi-year low prices, are now adding gas rigs and boosting production as the price has crossed the $4.6 mark this week. The slowing output in 2024, a booming LNG industry, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in years have driven gas prices up by over 150% over the last year.\n\nAnother significant growth driver for America\u2019s natural gas industry is the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and the accompanying data centers, which consume 10 to 50 times the amount of energy per square foot of a typical commercial office building. These energy intensive facilities could consume as much as 9% of all energy generated in the US by 2030, and this energy needs to come from a relatively clean, flexible, and reliable source that is abundantly available in the form of natural gas. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. Several gas majors are now even bypassing traditional utilities and building power plants to connect directly to data centers, a move that could reshape the industry in the years to come, if it pays off.",

            "content": "The NASDAQ index has officially moved into correction territory. That means a drop of more than 10% from its most recent high in December 2024. The NASDAQ is the home of many of the best-performing technology stocks of the last two years. It\u2019s also a home for many meme stocks that poke their heads up when markets get frothy.\n\nEven if you\u2019re an experienced investor, moves like this can shake your conviction. However, before you consider your next move, here are some important things to consider.\n\nDon\u2019t Sell Out of Panic\n\nThis is easy to say but can be tough to do. If your portfolio is down 10%, 20% or more, particularly in a short period of time, it\u2019s tempting to believe that you\u2019re better off cutting your losses. However, this is rarely an effective strategy for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, if the company has been trading for some time, look at its long-term stock chart. Chances are there will be some peaks and valleys, but the trend is likely in favor of growth. That's why investors will say time in the market is greater than timing the market. Markets reward patience. The biggest money is made by buying near the lows and selling near the highs, not vice versa.\n\nSecond, many stocks, particularly volatile technology stocks, have a history of corrections. Volatility is the price of growth. In many cases, the stock retraces back to the prior level and pushes to even higher gains. If you sell, you\u2019ll miss out on that growth.\n\nRemember Why You Own the Stock\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NVDA]\n\nInvestors who do their due diligence before buying a stock have specific reasons for owning the stocks they own. If those reasons are still in place, then it\u2019s usually better to let the correction run its course.\n\nA good example of this in the current correction is NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVDA stock is down more than 23% in the last three months and is now down nearly 20% in 2025.\n\nThe natural question is why; the answer seems to be that the stock was simply overvalued. That will lead many investors to take some profit. But once that selling starts, it can take on a life of its own.\n\nIf investors still believe that the AI revolution is in its early stages and NVIDIA will continue to play an essential role, the best course of action is to hold on to the stock. And if it gets below their average cost, they can selectively buy to lower their average cost and set themselves up for larger gains when the stock inevitably turns around.\n\nBy contrast, investors who believe that a stock no longer fits their buying thesis may consider selling it altogether. Continuing with our NVIDIA example, if investors believe there will be significantly less spending on AI infrastructure than previously forecast, now may be a good time to sell NVDA stock.\n\nRemember the \u201cD\u201d Words:Key Strategies for Market Corrections\n\nNot selling out of panic doesn\u2019t mean that investors should just give their portfolios a pass. Market corrections should be an opportunity to optimize their portfolios. To do this, remember these three key \u201cD\u201d words.\n\nDiversification: In 2025, many investors may have too much exposure to technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent 7, which are aptly named because that\u2019s where the growth was. However, this correction may be a time to rotate out of technology and into other sectors that can give a portfolio more balance.\n\nDefensive: Since the 2024 election, there\u2019s been a rotation out of technology stocks. That sell-off is accelerating. And right now, that means putting money into defensive stocks. These are stocks from companies that make products that consumers will always need.\n\nAt this time, consumer staples stocks such as The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ), or Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) can be attractive options.\n\nDividends: Many defensive stocks have another attractive quality: they pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of a company\u2019s profit that gets paid out in cash to shareholders. Dividends give investors a regular source of income that they can use for their expenses, or they can reinvest and allow their investment to benefit from compounding.\n\nConsider Alternative Investments\n\nDuring times of volatility, investors may choose to invest in alternative investments such as bonds and precious metals. Bonds tend to have an inverse relationship to stocks, so when stocks are falling, bonds tend to increase in value. Precious metals are considered to be a store of value and can be attractive to investors during times of high inflation.\n\nMake a Stock Watchlist\n\nCorrections often create opportunities for investors to invest in a company that had become too expensive to invest in previously. That\u2019s one reason investors have watchlists. This can contain stocks to buy if the price becomes more attractive.\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:TSLA]\n\nFor example, an investor was excited about Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), but it seemed too overvalued when the stock was trading for over $475 a share. However, as of this writing, it\u2019s down over 43% for the year, and it's trading at around $226 per share.\n\nAlthough there are still questions about its valuation, this may be a much more attractive entry point, particularly since investors don\u2019t know when a reversal may occur.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"Beyond a Market Correction, Moves to Make Now\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

Entering the year with a 10% equity overweight, JP Morgan has since reduced this to 5%, reallocating some exposure to US, developed non-US, and emerging markets. Camporeale noted that while policy uncertainty raises questions about growth and earnings outlooks, the US economy remains strong, with a 4% unemployment rate, 3% GDP growth, and solid corporate balance sheets. He said that despite short-term market turbulence, recession risks remain low, and their portfolio maintains an equity overweight alongside high-yield exposure. He also pointed out that it is still early in President Trump's second term and too soon to draw definitive conclusions about its impact. He believes that lower interest rates could pave the way for positive fiscal and deregulation policies that have yet to fully materialize. Despite current market fears, he remains optimistic about the economy\u2019s strength and low recession probability.\n\nHickey weighed in on the uncertainty dominating markets, emphasizing that no one can predict the full impact of tariffs. He referenced Target CEO Brian Cornell\u2019s comments earlier in the day about the lack of certainty regarding tariffs, taxes, rates, and the economy. Hickey remarked that this stew of uncertainty is keeping investors cautious. He noted that intraday rallies, such as the one seen earlier in the day after bouncing off the 200-day moving average, are often short-lived due to unpredictable policy developments. For instance, Trump\u2019s speeches have recently been followed by market declines, adding to investor hesitancy. He also highlighted historical context for pullbacks like the current one: since World War II, there have been 64 instances of a 5% drop from all-time highs in the S&P 500. While not uncommon, he advised caution in the short term due to unpredictable market reactions.",

            "content": "Analysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 10.01\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is an American multinational energy company, headquartered in Texas. The company is engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it saw a significant rise in production, with output increasing by 14.8% year-over-year to 2,183 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). This growth was largely fueled by strategic acquisitions, including the completion of its Marathon Oil acquisition in November 2024. Financially, the company remained strong, generating $20.1 billion in operating cash flow for the year, with total cash from operations reaching $20.3 billion.\n\nRecently, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has prioritized enhancing operational efficiency and expanding its LNG business. Its strong performance has been supported by disciplined cost management, seamless integration of acquisitions, and advancements in low-carbon technologies. As part of its sustainability efforts, the company earned the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard in 2024, highlighting its commitment to reducing emissions.\n\nConocoPhillips returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. Following a 34% increase in October, its quarterly dividend now stands at $0.78 per share. With 10 consecutive years of dividend growth, it is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.52%, as of March 6.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 6th on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Those lawsuits were filed by California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.\n\nNearly all the cases heard by the Supreme Court are appeals of rulings by lower courts. But the top U.S. judicial body has \"original jurisdiction\" in a small set of cases pitting states against states.\n\nThe suits by the Democratic-led states, seeking monetary damages, generally accused the energy companies of creating a public nuisance or violating state laws by concealing from the public for decades the fact that burning fossil fuels would lead to climate change. The companies denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe 2024 litigation led by Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall was joined by his counterparts in Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThey argued that by suing major energy companies in state courts and seeking damages for the harms of climate change, the Democratic-led states were unlawfully trying to regulate global emissions and the U.S. energy system.\n\nOnly the federal government can regulate interstate gas emissions, and the Democratic-led states have exceeded their authority by seeking \"sweeping injunctive relief or a catastrophic damages award that could restructure the national energy system,\" the Republican-led states argued.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has rejected several attempts by the oil companies themselves to dismiss various climate change cases by state and local governments or move them to federal court.\n\nFor instance, the Supreme Court on Jan. 13 declined to hear a bid by Sunoco and other oil companies to scuttle a lawsuit by Honolulu after the Hawaii Supreme Court allowed the climate change case to move forward.\n\nDemocratic former President Joe Biden's administration in 2024 argued that the Supreme Court should skip hearing both the industry's Honolulu case appeal as well as the lawsuit by the 19 Republican-led states.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump's administration is expected to oppose such lawsuits going forward. The Trump campaign ahead of the 2024 election pledged to \"stop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists.\"\n\nThe Democratic-led states, led by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in a filing called the Republican case against them \"meritless\" and said it rested on a misunderstanding of their climate change lawsuits.\n\nThey argued the lawsuits did not seek to impose liability on oil companies based on their fossil fuel production generally but instead sought to \"address local harms resulting from unlawful deceptive conduct by private defendants.\"",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other most undervalued large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOn March 4, David Katz, Chief Investment Officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to share his perspective on the current state of the bull market and what February\u2019s mixed action and sector rotation might signal for the rest of the year. Katz acknowledged that while people might not want to hear it, the volatility seen in February is likely to persist throughout the year, with both upside and downside movements. He emphasized that this creates opportunities for investors but also necessitates caution. Katz highlighted several positive factors supporting the market, which included a strong economy and solid corporate performance. However, he expressed concerns about certain policies from the administration, such as tariffs, immigration, and the relationship with the Fed. While these issues have been largely ignored by the market so far, Katz warned that they could eventually lead to a 3-5% correction. Despite this, he remained optimistic about the economy\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges and recommended buying into market dips rather than chasing rallies.\n\nTo support his sentiment, Katz pointed to companies that have already experienced significant corrections and are positioned to perform well regardless of broader market movements. He highlighted their strong fundamentals, attractive valuations (most trading at under 13-14 times earnings), and good outlooks. He also noted that last year\u2019s market leaders have slowed significantly, while sectors that underperformed are beginning to show meaningful improvement, a trend he expects to continue. This sector rotation suggests that investors should be prepared to adapt their strategies as different sectors gain momentum throughout the year.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks trading between $10 billion and $200 billion. We then selected stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15 and made a list of 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

            "content": "Moreover, Eagle Capital Management follows a value-oriented investment strategy with a long-term perspective, assessing price in relation to intrinsic value rather than relying solely on traditional valuation metrics like price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios. The firm\u2019s investment team focuses on long-term prospects, particularly beyond five years, analyzing business growth, industry dynamics, and margin potential while identifying opportunities that the broader market may overlook. A key component of Eagle\u2019s strategy is maintaining a \u201cMargin of Safety,\u201d achieved through valuation discounts, business resilience, growth potential, and strong, experienced leadership.\n\nEagle Capital Management adheres to a disciplined investment philosophy centered on identifying undervalued companies with unrecognized long-term growth potential. The firm employs a fundamental, bottom-up research approach, focusing on the key drivers of long-term value creation. By maintaining an extended investment horizon, Eagle Capital is able to take a distinctive perspective on industry and company trends. The firm\u2019s investment strategy prioritizes businesses with two essential characteristics: strong underlying assets capable of generating cash flow and sustaining value even in challenging market conditions, and transformative changes within the company that remain unrecognized by the broader market yet are likely to drive future growth. This approach aims to provide downside protection during market downturns while positioning the portfolio for enhanced returns as these changes materialize. These core principles have been integral to Eagle Capital\u2019s strategy since its founding, forming the foundation of its competitive advantage and contributing to its consistent market outperformance since 1988.\n\nEagle Capital Management , a New York-based hedge fund, was founded in 1988 by Beth and Ravenel Curry. Their son, Ravenel Boykin Curry IV, joined the firm around the early 2000s after managing a portfolio at Kingdon Capital and is currently a key partner. A Yale University graduate with an Economics degree and an MBA from Harvard Business School, he plays a pivotal role in the firm\u2019s strategy. Historically, Eagle has outperformed major benchmarks, including the broader market and the Russell Value Index. Over five years, Eagle delivered a 5.7% return versus the market's 2.4%, and since its inception, it has generated a cumulative return of 2,031%, significantly surpassing both indices.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Eagle Capital Management . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe firm concentrates its portfolio on high-conviction investments, typically holding 25-35 stocks. As of Q4 2024, it holds over $27.4 billion in 13F securities, and its top ten positions account for 57.62% of its portfolio. This approach allows Eagle to focus on asymmetric risk opportunities, ensuring that its top positions offer significant upside potential while maintaining strong downside protection. Adopting a private equity-style approach to public equity investing, Eagle builds positions in high-quality businesses with sustainable returns and durability. A rigorous due diligence process precedes any investment decision, and the firm leverages direct access to senior management at portfolio companies to gain deeper insights into long-term strategies, enabling decisive action when the right opportunities emerge. Since its inception, Eagle has consistently applied the same investment philosophy, aiming to generate superior returns through rigorous valuation analysis and a long-term perspective. The firm\u2019s long-term investment horizon allows it to take a differentiated approach to market trends, focusing on businesses undervalued relative to their intrinsic earnings power.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Eagle Capital Management\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of the hedge fund\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024. To assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1,008 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) the Best Dividend Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 86\n\nEagle Capital Management\u2019s Equity Stake: $1.95 Billion\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) reported Q4 2024 earnings of $2.3 billion, or $1.90 per share, surpassing analyst estimates but falling significantly short of $3.0 billion, or $2.52 per share, reported in the same period the previous year. Full-year earnings also declined from $11.0 billion in 2023 to $9.2 billion in 2024. However, production levels exceeded guidance, driven by strong performance from Lower 48 operations, which saw a 5% year-over-year increase. The recent Marathon Oil acquisition by ConocoPhillips is yielding benefits, with the company forecasting a capital expenditure of under $13 billion for 2025, down from the combined $13.5 billion in 2024. Despite the positive forecast, analysts downgraded COP from a Strong Buy to an Outperform rating, while also reducing the stock\u2019s price target from $157 to $124.\n\nDespite the downgrade, analysts still consider ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) one of the most efficiently managed exploration and production companies, with an attractive valuation based on discounted cash flow and multiple analysis. The change in rating reflects the lack of a near-term growth catalyst rather than concerns over the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals. While the company\u2019s global asset portfolio remains strong, the absence of immediate drivers for significant stock appreciation has led to a more cautious stance.\n\nA pure-play oil and natural gas producer, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has had a significant surge in production for Q4 2024, reaching 2.18 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, largely driven by its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. This consolidation reflects a broader industry trend toward efficiency, but despite expansion, the company\u2019s stock has declined 10% over the past two years, highlighting a disconnect between growth and shareholder returns. With Brent crude prices projected to drop to $74 per barrel and supply expected to outpace demand, market volatility remains a key concern. Despite uncertain conditions, ConocoPhillips maintains efficiency with a production cost of $19.18 per barrel, ensuring profitability and strong dividends.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors in Q2 included CarMax, Target Corporation and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Shares of oil and gas exploration and production company ConocoPhillips declined against a backdrop of lower oil prices in Q2, as well as concerns about the expensive though strategically sound acquisition of Marathon Oil.\u201d\n\nOverall COP ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks to buy according to Eagle Capital Management. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

I don't think it was the perfect game, but the ladies battled,\" said UAA head coach, who earned his fifth GNAC Tourney title since taking the reins in 2012-13. \"I truly believe that no one works harder than they do, and we're doing this with eight players. I'm just super proud of them \u2013 they played so great.\"With the memory of their 57-53 road loss to the Saints in the regular-season finale still fresh in their minds, the Seawolves fell behind 20-18 late in the first quarter of the teams' rubber match. UAA answered with an 9-0 run, however, getting a midrange jumper and a deep three-pointer from Evans to take the lead for good.UAA extended to a 43-34 halftime edge despite seeing honorable mention All-GNAC forward(12 points, 5-6 FG, 4 rebounds, 2 steals) hit the bench with her third foul, and having Long limited to just four minutes with two early fouls.Playing in their first GNAC title game, the Saints continued to push for a third upset in three nights, drawing within 41-37 on a layup by Rios midway through the third quarter.Leading 55-50, the Seawolves finally took control when Long and junior forwardcombined for seven straight points, and Long foundfor a dagger three-pointer to make it 65-52 at the buzzer.With Hollingshead dominating the boards (seven offensive rebounds) and Evans running point, the Seawolves overcame major foul trouble in the fourth quarter, switching to a zone defense to limit the Saints to 2-of-8 shooting down the stretch.\"This has been a goal since day one, and we put in so much work,\" said Hollingshead, a First Team All-GNAC center. \"I didn't realize that I played that long (a UAA season- and career-high 38 minutes), but if it helped the team that's all I care about.

The acquisition also significantly impacted the company\u2019s Full Year 2024 financial results, resulting in a 45 per cent surge in revenue to N4.1 trillion.\n\nMost recently, the company rewarded its shareholders with 1.28 billion additional shares in the form of stock dividends.

            "content": "United States President Donald Trump has vowed to make it easier to develop oil and gas projects in Alaska, despite concerns about environmental degradation. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to \u201cunleash Alaska\u2019s extraordinary resource potential\u201d, effectively undoing former President Biden\u2019s climate protections for the state. However, it is uncertain whether oil and gas companies will invest in a region with such strict regulations and high project development costs. In addition, many fear potential lawsuits from environmental and indigenous organisations against new developments, as well as what a change in U.S. administration could mean for projects in the future.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s order aims to expedite the permitting and leasing of energy projects in Alaska, undo resource development restrictions on state and federal lands including crucial areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), overturn the cancellation of leases within the ANWR, and prioritise the development of LNG.\n\nAlaska\u2019s oil production decreased from around 2 million bpd in 1988 to just 426,000 bpd in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At present, just two major projects are under development, ConocoPhillips\u2019s $8 billion Willow and Santos\u2019 Pikka, which are expected to increase the state\u2019s output to 650,000 bpd.\n\nMany oil and gas companies are wary of developing projects in Alaska due to the high costs involved with operations, the lack of regulatory stability, and litigation risks. Much of the state\u2019s oil and gas reserves are within federally protected lands such as ANWR and NPR-A, which make project development risky, as a change in administration could mean more policy changes. In addition, several environmental groups have launched lawsuits against oil and gas developers in Alaska in recent years, citing environmental and climate concerns. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2026 where this administration breaks the law we will fight and we will enforce the environmental laws in Alaska,\u201d the managing attorney at Earthjustice Carole Holley stated .\n\nReferring to the areas Trump is aiming to reopen for oil and gas exploration, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute Dustin Meyers stated , \u201cMany of these areas have been closed for a good long while.\u201d Meyers added, \u201cThere is always the risk that these areas could be reclosed after the next election cycle.\u201d This view reflects the concerns of several oil majors.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Energy Agency expects global demand for oil to slow over the next decade, while many oil and gas companies are moving to easier-to-develop areas where they can implement \u201c low-carbon oil \u201d operations.\n\nThe Trump administration aims to attract investment for the $44 billion Alaska LNG project on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, originally proposed by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) around a decade ago. The project was authorized by President Trump\u2019s administration in 2020 and was reauthorized by the Biden administration in 2022. If developed, it could provide 20 million tonnes of LNG per year.\n\n\u201c[Alaska] is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far. We\u2019re talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and [the US] having to do with Alaska oil and gas,\u201d Trump said at a joint press conference. However, over the last decade, several big players, including BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, have pulled out of the project.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that oil majors will flock to Alaska, given the plethora of challenges involved with managing oil and gas operations in the state, the threat of tariffs from the Trump administration could reinvigorate interest. On 4th March, Trump introduced 25 percent tariffs on the import of Mexican and Canadian products and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods. This has made other countries fear a similar move on their products. Trump has threatened tariffs on various countries and regions, such as the EU, if they do not increase the purchase of energy from the U.S. in the coming months.\n\nIn early February, Japanese trading giant Mitsui announced it may consider investing in the Alaska LNG project, although no decisions had been made. Japan is the second-largest LNG importer globally and the government has stated that it may be open to purchasing more LNG and other energy products from the U.S., most likely in a bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on Japanese products.\n\nA few days later, Taiwan\u2019s Economy Ministry expressed interest in purchasing more LNG from the U.S., particularly from Alaska. Taiwan\u2019s state energy company CPC is \u201cindeed quite interested in Alaska's natural gas and will continue to assess the feasibility and is also willing to make additional purchases,\u201d the Ministry said in a statement.\n\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan, and several EU member states have expressed interest in buying more U.S. oil and gas to reduce trade gaps that put them at risk of U.S. tariffs. However, with record highs being seen in U.S. gas production over the last year, it is not clear whether this will attract the interest and investment needed to develop new fossil fuel operations in Alaska.\n\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy ConocoPhillips (COP) Is Plunging So Far in 2025?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 86\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas companies.\n\nThe stock is down significantly so far in 2025 due to a decline in oil prices, though natural gas prices have been up recently. Regardless, the drop in oil caused a 3.7% decline in Q4 2024 revenue to $14.7 billion.\n\nNet income fell almost 16% to $2.4 billion, and this has caused ConocoPhillips to underperform its peers. Broader macroeconomic fears and the shock of tariffs have also contributed to COP stock being red year-to-date.\n\nThe consensus price target of $133.47 implies 47.28% upside.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock is down 7.86% year-to-date.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 15th on our list of big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "African national oil companies (NOCs) partnering with independents to drive E&P\n\nAfrica\u2019s national oil companies (NOC) are moving beyond operating as state-representatives by transforming themselves into competitive upstream players. By strengthening their balance-sheets through partial privatization, transferring their regulatory roles to independent entities and acquiring more assets, NOCs are emerging as strong partners for foreign firms.\n\nBoosting production\n\nMajor oil producers in Africa are striving to boost production and NOC-IOC collaboration is at the forefront. Libya\u2019s NOC is working with IOCs Repsol, bp, TotalEnergies, ConocoPhillips and more to increase output to two million barrels per day (bpd). In collaboration with the NOC, TotalEnergies has achieved a 20% increase in production at the Waha field; Repsol plans to drill nine new prospects in 2025; while Eni is planning four exploration wells in 2025. Algeria\u2019s Sonatrach will increase hydrocarbon production by 2.5% this year, actively pursuing international partnerships following a revision of its Hydrocarbons Law in 2029. Negotiations are underway with ExxonMobil and Chevron to boost exploration. These efforts reflect a broader trend across the continent, where NOCs are leaning on foreign partnerships to advance oil and gas production.\n\nAdvancing gas monetization\n\nAmid a surge in gas monetization, Africa has emerged as a major LNG producer. Collaboration between NOCs and IOCs have been at the forefront of this gas drive, leading to the emergence of new LNG exporters. Senegal\u2019s Petrosen and Mauritania\u2019s SMH worked alongside bp and Kosmos Energy to develop the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project \u2013 situated on the maritime border of the two countries and producing first LNG in January 2025. Mozambique\u2019s ENH is working closely with foreign operators to develop several LNG projects, including TotalEnergies (Mozambique LNG); ExxonMobil (Rovuma LNG) and Eni (Coral South and Coral North). The 3.4 mtpa Coral South FLNG project has been operating since 2022 while ExxonMobil plans to make FID on Rovuma LNG in 2026.\n\nThe Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation is developing the Tanzania LNG project, working with Shell and Equinor to monetize resources in Blocks 1, 2 and 4. While development has been delayed, the operators remain committed to collaboratively bringing the project online. In Angola, which has been an LNG producer since 2013, the NOC Sonangol is working with its New Gas Consortium partners Azule Energy, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company and TotalEnergies to increase LNG production capacity. The partners completed the offshore platform for Angola\u2019s first non-associated gas project in February 2025, with production on track for early-2026.\n\nUnlocking new E&P markets\n\nA slate of discoveries in recent years have opened up new oil and gas plays across the continent. Following an increase in its oil and gas budget from $120 million to $246 million for the 2024/2025 period, the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) is driving exploration across underexplored areas in the country. In partnership with TotalEnergies and CNOOC, the company will start production at the Kingfisher and Tilenga oilfields in 2025. UNOC is also advancing exploration in the Moroto-Kyoga basins, with preliminary studies aimed at uncovering new oil fields.\n\nIn Namibia, NAMCOR is working with IOCs toward first oil production from the Orange Basin by 2029. Major projects include the Mopane field, which made its third discovery last month, and the Venus field, which targets FID in 2026. The company aims to secure higher stakes in future oil and gas projects \u2013 increasing its share from the minimum 10% to between 20-30% - underscoring a commitment to greater participation in field development.\n\nMeanwhile, the South Africa National Petroleum Company (SANPC) \u2013 launched in September 2024 \u2013 strives to facilitate greater investment in exploration, natural gas monetization and infrastructure development. While major gas deposits were found in the Outeniqua Basin in 2019 and 2020, operational challenges have impacted development. The SANPC seeks to address these challenges through IOC collaboration and foreign investment. The company also strives to unlock the potential of the Orange Basin.\n\n\u201cAfrican NOCs are driving the continent\u2019s next wave of innovative oil and gas developments. By partnering with global operators and strengthening their operational capacity, NOCs are not only driving projects forward but showcasing the competitiveness of African operators,\u201d states Tom\u00e1s Gerbasio, VP Commercial and Strategic Engagement, African Energy Chamber.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips (COP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this energy company have returned -11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which ConocoPhillips belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ConocoPhillips is expected to post earnings of $2.03 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.10 points to a change of +4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.78 indicates a change of +8.4% from what ConocoPhillips is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ConocoPhillips.",

            "content": "Dividend stocks lack the glitz and glam of high-octane growth stocks. But they can make up for it by passing along profits to shareholders no matter what the market is doing. Similarly, value stocks are priced based on their existing profits rather than what they could make in the future. In other words, expectations for future growth aren't great, and the valuation reflects that sentiment.\n\nInvestors looking for dividend-paying stocks at reasonable valuations have come to the right place. Here's why these three Motley Fool contributors have identified American Electric Power (AEP 1.24%), Owens Corning (OC -3.36%), and ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) as top dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nAmerican Electric Power is a passive income powerhouse\n\nScott Levine (American Electric Power): Shares of American Electric Power may have soared more than 15% since the start of the year, but that doesn't mean the stock is too pricey for dividend-hungry investors. Providing an enticing forward dividend yield of 3.5%, this electric utility stock -- which has paid a dividend every quarter since 1910 -- underperformed the S&P 500 last year, and while it's outperforming the index so far in 2025, it's still sitting in the bargain bin.\n\nProviding electric service to about 5.6 million customers located in 11 states, AEP maintains a robust network of about 40,000 miles of transmission lines and 225,000 miles of distribution lines, as well as a diverse power generation fleet that includes coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy assets that total 28 gigawatts of capacity.\n\nIncome investors interested in a reliable dividend stock will find American Electric Power especially appealing because the company generates the lion's share of its earnings -- about 95% of earnings per share -- from its regulated business. This gives management clear foresight into future cash flows, enabling it to plan accordingly for capital expenditures such as infrastructure upgrades and dividend payments.\n\nFrom 2025 through 2029, for example, management expects to generate operating cash of $41.5 billion and pay out about $11.1 billion in dividends.\n\nFor those who are charged up with the prospects of an investment in this leading electric utility, now's a great time to initiate a position. Shares of American Electric Power are trading at 8.9 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average of 9.3.\n\nOwens Corning stock could fly if the housing market makes a recovery\n\nLee Samaha (Owens Corning): Trading at 10 times trailing earnings and 11.3 times trailing free cash flow (FCF), this building materials company is definitely in value stock territory. Moreover, the company returned $638 million of its $1.25 million in FCF to investors through share buybacks and dividends (current yield is 1.7%).\n\nAs always, there's a reason why the market rates Owens Corning low: its exposure to the North American residential housing market. As management noted in the latest earnings release, \"The key economic factors that impact the company's business are residential repair activity, residential remodeling activity, U.S. housing starts, and commercial construction activity.\"\n\nIt's no secret that these end markets have been challenging, as market interest rates (which lead mortgage rates) have stayed higher for longer than many anticipated. That said, history suggests that \"fighting the Fed\" (in the form of the bond market sending market rates in the opposite direction of the Federal Reserve rate) will not pay off over the long term.\n\nOn that basis, market conditions will improve for Owens Corning, and the company took advantage of the downturn to buy doors business Masonite for $3.9 billion in 2024 to increase its exposure to the North American residential market. The deal adds doors to Owens Corning's existing roofing and insulation offerings. In addition, the company is selling its non-core glass fiber reinforcement business for an enterprise value of $755 million as it increasingly pivots to building materials.\n\nOwens Corning's attractive valuation and potential upside to earnings from an improving housing market make it an exciting stock for dividend-seeking investors who are optimistic about housing.\n\nConocoPhillips is betting big on its U.S. oil and gas production\n\nDaniel Foelber (ConocoPhillips): ConocoPhillips is the most valuable U.S.-based exploration and production company -- with a market cap nearly double second-place EOG Resources. And with 2025 expected production of 2.34 million to 2.38 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, it is the third-largest U.S. producer behind only ExxonMobil and Chevron.\n\nIts 2023 production mix was roughly half oil and half natural gas, with the continental U.S. (Lower 48 states) making up 58% of production; Canada and Alaska comprising 16% of production; Europe, Middle East, and Africa with 14%; and Asia Pacific contributing 11%.\n\nHowever, the Lower 48 should make up a higher percentage of overall production in 2025 -- which will be the first full year of earnings that includes the added production from the acquisition of Marathon Oil.\n\nIn 2025, ConocoPhillips plans to ramp up capital expenditures to the highest level in 10 years. The investment will help develop its existing asset base and fund long-term projects that should boost FCF over time. These projects are expected to start up between 2026 and 2029 and include the company's massive investment in Qatar's North Field East and North Field South expansion projects, oil production in Alaska, and its Port Arthur liquefied gas project.\n\nConocoPhillips is a coiled spring for FCF growth, even at current oil and gas prices. In 2024, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $76.63 per barrel. Even in those mid-cycle conditions, ConocoPhillips generated a whopping $8 billion in FCF, or $6.78 in FCF per share compared to dividends paid of $3.12.\n\nThe company should continue to generate more FCF over the next five years so long as oil prices don't fall substantially. But even if they do, ConocoPhillips has a sizable margin of error where it can still turn a profit. Synergies from the Marathon Oil acquisition should bring its FCF breakeven to the low $30 per boe range. Granted, at that level, the energy giant wouldn't be able to support its dividend with cash. But that cushion is still sizable considering WTI oil prices are currently around $70 per barrel.\n\nWith a 3.1% dividend yield, ConocoPhillips stands out as a solid dividend stock to buy for investors who are neutral on the oil and gas industry and are looking to collect passive income from an industry-leading company.",

            "content": "Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (XOM -0.42%), Chevron (CVX 0.62%), and ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) were all trailing the market today, falling 3.6%, 2.8%, and 4.2% at their lows, before recovering to declines of 3%, 1.9%, and 3%, respectively, as of 12:51 p.m. ET.\n\nThe declines stood in contrast to the broader market indices, which all bounced into positive territory by that time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, oil prices were down sharply on the day. Lower oil prices may could offer some relief to consumers, perhaps explaining the rise in other sectors, but the reasons for the price decline may not ultimately be a great sign for the economy overall.\n\nA weak jobs report, tariff threats, and Russia\n\nThis morning, the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) jobs report for February was released, coming in far below expectations. Private sector jobs added were just 77,000, down from the 186,000 added in January and well below the 144,000 that was expected.\n\nThe big miss was likely caused by the same factors that has caused a recent downturn in consumer sentiment, as well as reductions in estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) growth: tariff uncertainty, along with cuts to government spending and the laying off of large swathes of federal workers.\n\nThese rapid-fire changes have upended the prospects of economic growth in the near-term and increased the possibility of stagflation, since tariffs raise prices to consumers while also harming economic activity and lowering business confidence.\n\nAnother possible headwind to these three stocks is that the Trump administration has said it would likely counter price increases from tariffs by \"unleashing American energy,\" thereby lowering energy prices for consumers. For instance, just today, the Trump administration's Department of Energy approved an extension of Exxon's Golden Pass LNG export terminal.\n\nThe problem for energy stocks is that while lower regulations would be a tailwind for production growth, increased supply could also cause lower prices, counteracting those lower costs and leading to a potential overall negative impact to profits.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, there is also the possibility that another big source of global oil supply may come online soon in a bigger way: Russia.\n\nTwo days ago, it was reported that the Trump administration had directed officials to draft a proposal on lifting sanctions on Russia, which would likely come in conjunction with a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. Then yesterday, Russian officials said ending the war would be conditional on those sanctions being relieved.\n\nRussia is obviously a big oil producer, and while it has been able to sell oil via some workarounds amid sanctions put on by the Biden administration, full sanctions relief could make it easier to sell to more countries, and thereby receive better prices. Increased competition in currently sanctioned countries could lower the overall price of Brent Crude, which is the price at which Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have been realizing.\n\nSlowdown or no?\n\nEnergy stock shares did rebound off their lows later in the day, as did most stocks, after the administration announced a one-month pause in tariffs for automakers who complied with the 2020 USMCA agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada during the trading day.\n\nThat being said, the chaotic tariff announcements, delays, and backpedals are clearly causing employers to slow down hiring amid all the uncertainty. Judging by recent data, an economic slowdown appears to be happening. Whether it turns into a recession or amounts to just a growth scare remains to be seen.\n\nLower oil prices may be good for consumers, assuming they still have a job, but it won't be great for these oil giants. While these three may see some relief on regulations and costs, the offset of lower oil and gas prices may more than compensate for it.\n\nEnergy investors therefore need to hope for a pickup in growth once the economy digests all the tariffs, federal layoffs, and perhaps the relaxation of Russian sanctions in the first few months of the new Administration.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before Spring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nSeasonality in the Stock Market\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \"Sell in May and Go Away\" is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nSectors Outperforming in Spring\n\nJPMorgan's Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\n\"In the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\"\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.",

With a market cap of $126.2 billion, ConocoPhillips employs nearly 11,800 people and operates in 13 countries across the Americas, Indo-Pacific, and the EMEA region.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \"large-cap stocks,\" and ConocoPhillips fits this bill perfectly. Given its dominance in the oil & gas industry, its valuation above this mark is not surprising. With a commitment to safe and responsible development, the company accesses, develops and produces oil & natural gas to help meet the world's energy needs.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nHowever, it's not all rainbows and sunshine, ConocoPhillips has plummeted 31.5% from its two-year high of $135.18 touched on Apr. 12, 2024. Furthermore, COP stock has plunged 12.7% over the past three months, lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s ($NASX) 5.8% dip during the same time frame.\n\nOver the longer term, ConocoPhillips\u2019 performance looks even grimmer. COP stock has plummeted 18.9% over the past 52 weeks and 15.7% over the past six months, lagging behind NASX\u2019s 12.8% surge over the past year and 7.1% gains over the past six months.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, COP stock has remained consistently below the 200-day moving average since late May 2024 and traded along its downward trending 50-day moving average over the past months.\n\nConocoPhillips stock observed a marginal decline after the release of its Q4 results on Feb. 6. While the company delivered a notable increase of 281 MBOED in production compared to the year-ago quarter to 2,183 MBOED, due to a decrease in oil prices ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall topline decreased 3.7% year-over-year to $14.7 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income dropped nearly 16% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. However, on a positive note, the company\u2019s topline surpassed the Street\u2019s expectations by 41 basis points and its adjusted EPS of $1.98 exceeded the consensus estimates by 4.2%, which mitigated the drop in stock prices.\n\nFurthermore, COP has also underperformed its peer EOG Resources, Inc.\u2019s (EOG) 3.8% gains over the past year and a 2.5% dip over the past six months.\n\nNonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the stock\u2019s long-term prospects. COP has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating among the 28 analysts covering the stock. Its mean price target of $130.62 represents a 41% premium to current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Time for another edition of our TOP WELL REPORT.\n\nMost production data is out for January. BC and Saskatchewan data has been reported in full, while Alberta has reported oil, condensate, and gas; full Alberta NGL data (including pentane) and marketable gas is due out in a week or so. While the January data won\u2019t be considered complete until the rest of the Alberta data has been reported, it is nonetheless worthwhile to show the data as it stands today. Pentane volumes in Alberta will not be represented yet for January which may affect liquids results, and \u201cgas equivalent\u201d volumes will be used instead of \u201cmarketable gas\u201d in cases where marketable gas is not yet available. As always, we use calendar day production metrics so these are real volumes produced in the month. Despite the incomplete version of this data, it is still interesting to present it as this data is fresh.\n\nBOE Intel subscribers can generate these reports for themselves whenever they want, and interact with the wells on the BOE Intel activity map. Subscribers are able to generate top well reports with more wells, on an overall basis, by formation, by company, by area, or by well type.\n\nTOP 15 OIL/CONDENSATE WELLS (see on map)\n\nTOP 15 NATURAL GAS WELLS (see on map)\n\nNotable oil/condensate wells:\n\nConocoPhillips impressed with the top 5 wells (and 6 out of 7) in January. All 6 wells come from the company\u2019s Montney development at Inga in northeast BC, with 2 wells in January coming in at over 2,000 bbl/d of condensate. For a closer look at the success the company is having in this area, check out the analysis done by HTM Energy Research here.\n\nVeren had 3 of the top 10 wells. These 3 Montney oil wells came from the Karr area, with the top well producing 1,376 bbl/d of oil in the month.\n\nARC Resources had 2 of the top 15 wells in January. Both wells have been extremely strong producers since being placed on production in August of 2024, although rates have been declining since reaching their peak rates late last year. Nonetheless, they remain strong producers and are the \u201coldest\u201d of any of the wells to be on the top well list this month.\n\nArcher Exploration continues to drill some of the best Charlie Lake wells around. This month the company had the only 2 Charlie Lake results to make the overall top 15. The two wells produced 1,085 bbl/d of oil and 874 bbl/d of oil, respectively.\n\nOvintiv doesn\u2019t just drill the best natural gas wells around, but came in with the #14 oil/condensate well in January. This well from Tower in northeast BC produced 856 bbl/d of condensate.\n\nRounding out the most prolific wells list is a Duvernay well from Spartan Delta that produced 838 bbl/d of oil in the month. This was the highest producing Duvernay well in Canada during the month.\n\nTOP 15 OIL/CONDENSATE WELLS \u2013 January volumes \u2013 (pentane volumes not yet reported for January in Alberta)\n\n*AB pentane volumes not yet reported. \u201cGas equivalent\u201d volumes represented in gas column until \u201cmarketable gas\u201d is reported.\n\n**TOP WELL REPORTS generally filter out oil sands/thermal wells, and only consider onshore Canadian production. However, BOE Intel subscribers can choose their own well types and include or exclude these wells\n\nNotable natural gas wells:\n\nThe most interesting part of the top natural gas wells is the lack of extremely large rates this month (not that 20 mmcf/d isn\u2019t a big well of course). It\u2019s likely the result of companies focusing efforts on the liquids rich parts of their acreage as a result of very low Canadian gas prices over the last several months. In fact, many of the top rates this month are from relatively \u201colder\u201d wells, as opposed to newer wells with lots of flush production. Only 4 of the top 15 natural gas wells were placed on production in November 2024 or after, compared to 12 of the top 15 oil/condensate wells.\n\nOvintiv had the top producing natural gas well in January, and 4 of the top 15. It was the only company to have a well over 20 mmcf/d in the month. Continuing with the theme mentioned in the bullet point above, Ovintiv has only placed 7 new wells on production in British Columbia since November of 2024 (keeping in mind the data lag from the newest results).\n\nCanadian Natural Resources continues to show that it has something special in the Falher formation in the Wapiti area of Alberta. With a lack of monster Montney gas wells from industry this month, CNRL was able to represent with 5 Falher wells near the top of the highest producing gas wells list, as well as a Montney well from Septimus.\n\nAlso with top 15 natural gas wells this month: Tourmaline \u2013 Spirit River well at Resthaven \u2013 18.2 mmcf/d ARC Resources \u2013 3 Montney wells from Sunrise \u2013 54.8 mmcf/d in total Advantage Energy \u2013 Montney well from Pouce Coupe South \u2013 18.7 mmcf/d\n\n\n\nTOP 15 NATURAL GAS WELLS \u2013 January volumes\n\n*AB pentane volumes not yet reported. \u201cGas equivalent\u201d volumes represented in gas column until \u201cmarketable gas\u201d is reported.",

            "content": "China has responded forcefully to President Donald Trump\u2019s recent tariff increases, implementing reciprocal tariffs on selected American goods, sanctioning U.S. companies, and announcing plans to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.\n\nWhat Happened: Beijing\u2019s actions, timed to coincide with the U.S. doubling of universal tariffs on Chinese goods, include duties of 15% on U.S. poultry and agricultural products such as wheat, corn, and cotton, reported South China Morning Post. Tariffs of 10% will be applied to imports of soybeans, pork, beef, and various food products.\n\n\u201cThe unilateral tariff measures launched by the United States seriously violate the rules of the WTO and undermine the basis for bilateral economic and trade cooperation,\u201d said a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson in an official statement.\n\nBeyond tariffs, the Ministry of Commerce added 15 U.S. firms to China\u2019s export control list, requiring special approval for them to receive exports of \u201cdual-use\u201d items. Another ten American companies were placed on Beijing\u2019s \u201cunreliable entity list,\u201d effectively banning them from trading with China or making new investments in the country.\n\nSee Also: NBA Legend Shaq Says His Net Worth \u2018Quadrupled' Once He Took Note From Jeff Bezos And Started Investing In Things That \u2018Change People's Lives'\n\nWhy It Matters: The escalation follows Trump\u2019s announcement last week to double tariffs on Chinese imports, augmenting the 10% duties in effect since February. These moves are widely viewed as the opening shots of a new trade war, with Trump signaling on his Truth Social platform that more tariffs could be coming on Apr. 2.\n\nEconomists note that while China\u2019s response is significant, it remains measured. \u201cToday\u2019s list covers agricultural goods such as soybeans that are important for trade between the two countries,\u201d said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \u201cBut China retaliated on a small share of U.S. exports. I think China is still trying not to escalate the trade war.\u201d\n\nEarlier in February, China had already imposed 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and high-displacement vehicles, affecting major U.S. exporters like Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Chevron Corp. CVX, and ConocoPhillips COP.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

He said he would impose reciprocal tariffs on April 2.\n\nHe said South Korea\u2019s average tariff was four times higher than that of the US, despite all the military and other assistance the United States provided to the country.\n\nOn March 2, the co-chair of the White House National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum said the 800-mile LNG gas pipeline would allow the United States to sell energy to its allies and \u201craise money for the US Treasury\u201d.\n\nWhile the Alaska LNG proposal faces cost and logistical hurdles, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and others are buying into the idea of increasing US gas imports more broadly.\n\nJapanese officials have not said they have agreed to participate in the pipeline but have agreed to look into the matter, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nJapan\u2019s trade minister plans to visit Washington later in March to seek exemptions from Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs and discuss Japan\u2019s plans to buy more US LNG.

            "content": "Crude oil prices have been pretty quiet so far this year. WTI, the primary U.S. oil price benchmark, has hovered around $70. Several factors are supporting this oil price, including OPEC's decision to hold back supplies, continued economic growth, and war-driven concerns about potential future supply disruptions.\n\nThat price point is an ideal level for many top oil stocks. Industry leaders like ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) can produce prodigious cash flows at $70 crude oil. Because of that, they are great oil stocks to buy right now for those seeking to cash in on the current environment.\n\nReturning $10 billion to shareholders\n\nConocoPhillips has transformed its operations over the years to become a low-cost oil producer. The U.S. oil giant has sold higher-cost oil assets and recycled that capital into acquiring lower-cost resources. It capped its transformation off last year by acquiring Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion deal. That purchase added over 2 billion barrels of oil and gas resources with an average cost of supply below $30. That further enhanced ConocoPhillips' resource portfolio, which has over 20 billion barrels of resources with an average cost of supply at $32 per barrel.\n\nWith a supply cost that low, ConocoPhillips can cash in on $70 crude oil. The oil company expects to produce enough cash to cover the $12.9 billion it plans to invest in capital projects to maintain and grow its production this year, while also returning $10 billion to shareholders. That cash return will come in the form of its dividend (ConocoPhillips boosted its payout by 34% late last year) and share repurchases. That's an increase from the $9.1 billion it returned to investors last year through dividends ($3.6 billion in dividends and variable return of cash payments) and $5.5 billion in repurchases.\n\nThose rising cash returns could help give ConocoPhillips the fuel to produce strong total returns for its investors this year if oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel.\n\nSending back 70% of its windfall to investors\n\nDevon Energy has followed a very similar blueprint as ConocoPhillips by selling off higher-cost assets and recycling the proceeds into low-cost operations. It most recently bought Grayson Mill Energy to bolster its position in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The company has large-scale resource positions across several key U.S. oil and gas production basins, led by the Delaware Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where it has an average breakeven level of $40 oil.",

            "content": "While efforts to reduce global carbon emissions continue, natural resource companies are adjusting by balancing traditional operations with sustainability initiatives. For example, the UAE has pledged $30 billion to a global finance fund while its banking sector aims to invest $270 billion in green finance by 2030 to support renewable energy growth. Simultaneously, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, which manage $3.8 trillion in assets, are increasingly allocating capital to green investments. This shift has not only reduced fiscal breakeven burdens for energy companies but has also increased regional economic stability.\n\nMoreover, technological advancements such as Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platforms are increasing the efficiency of offshore gas production while reducing reliance on onshore infrastructure. According to Business Wire, global liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction capacity is expected to double by 2028 from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA as expansion projects continue. This projected increase indicates that even as the world strives for cleaner energy sources, natural gas will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix.\n\nHowever, the natural resource sector has been experiencing a surge in market activity, driven mainly by commodity price movements and global demand. Precious metals, in particular, have proven to be strong assets. Over the past year, the market\u2019s Gold Index returned 44.59%, while the Silver Index returned 42.01%. These gains have resulted from rising investor interest in safe-haven assets due to inflationary pressures and escalating global trade tensions. As inflation erodes the value of fiat currencies, investors are increasingly turning to gold and silver as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty.\n\nThe top 40 global mining companies generated a record $943 billion in revenue in 2022, but this figure declined to approximately $792 billion in 2024, owing primarily to fluctuating commodity prices. Despite this, Deloitte reported that between January and mid-November 2024, the oil and gas industry paid out $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks, demonstrating the sector\u2019s strong cash returns.\n\nNatural resource stocks are an important part of the global economy, representing mining, energy, and agricultural companies. These industries are the foundation of numerous sectors, providing necessary materials for infrastructure, technology, and transportation. Despite the growing emphasis on renewable energy, fossil fuels, metals, and agricultural resources remain essential for modern economies. According to The Business Research Company , the global mineral market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. This growth emphasizes the long-term importance of natural resources.\n\nWe recently published a list of 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe chemicals industry is also shifting to sustainability, with renewable production of key chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, and olefins expected to cost between $440 billion and $1 trillion by 2040. According to PwC, this figure could rise to between $1.5 trillion and $3.3 trillion by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, innovative zinc recycling techniques have produced a 95% recovery rate from steel mill waste, converting industrial waste into useful recyclable components. Nanotechnology breakthroughs are increasing recovery efficiency in gold mining while reducing environmental impact. These technological advancements demonstrate the growing significance of technology in maximizing resource use and cutting waste, which propels the natural resource industry forward.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds, we first conducted extensive research to identify companies with significant exposure to the natural resource sector. We defined exposure in terms of mining, energy production, agriculture, or the extraction and processing of key commodities. We then analyzed these companies based on their hedge fund holdings and ranked them based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) the Best Natural Resources Stock to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is an independent exploration and production company that specializes in natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and crude oil and has established a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Canada, and the U.S. shale basins. The company maintains a strong presence in LNG markets due to key contracts and strategic assets that foster long-term expansion.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) produced 1.84 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOED) in 2024, marking a 3% increase from the previous year. This growth was primarily driven by a notable increase in LNG volumes and strong performance from U.S. shale operations. The company generated $21.3 billion in operating cash flow, driven by its efforts to maintain capital discipline and capitalize on rising commodity prices. However, because of increased operating costs and acquisition-related expenses that affected overall profitability, net income decreased to $11.2 billion from $18.7 billion in 2023.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) made great progress in growing its LNG strategy despite the profitability issues. The company established a long-term LNG sales agreement in Asia and obtained a long-term regasification agreement for Belgium\u2019s Zeebrugge LNG terminal in 2024. In addition, the company has significant stakes in LNG production plants in Australia and Qatar. Furthermore, the company secured a long-term capacity agreement for the Zeebrugge terminal, operated by Fluxys, thereby solidifying its LNG business as a crucial area of expansion.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced $1.3 billion in asset divestitures as part of its plan to simplify its holdings and strengthen its financial position. The $735 million sale of the company\u2019s interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields to Shell, which is anticipated to close by Q2 2025, came after the company\u2019s $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. The company also divested $600 million worth of non-core Lower 48 assets. These steps will help strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet and optimize its portfolio for future growth as part of its larger asset disposition target of $2 billion.\n\nGoing forward, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is committed to maintaining its current growth trajectory. With a continued focus on long-cycle projects and high-return shale assets, the company anticipates that production will range between 2.34 million and 2.38 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. To balance investments and guarantee long-term value creation, ConocoPhillips has set a target shareholder return of $10 billion. As it continues its trajectory of steady growth and innovation, the company is well-positioned to prosper in a dynamic and frequently volatile market environment.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 3rd on our list of best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global market for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), with the support of secure energy and industrial demand, is looking at continued expansion. The industry is forecasted to grow from $143.35 billion in 2024 to $155.85 billion in 2025, according to The Business Research Company. This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Looking further ahead, it is expected that the LNG market will reach $205.95 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.2%, which is predominantly attributed to the global demand for cleaner energy. The demand for LNG is majorly fulfilled by the U.S., exporting around 88.3 million metric tons (MT), which is up by 4.5% from 2023, according to LSEG.\n\nIn contrast, the global market also has a major impact from Europe\u2019s LNG demand. The region\u2019s demand accounted for 55% of total LNG exports by the U.S. in 2024, according to LSEG. LNG shipments of 5.84 MT were sent to Europe by the U.S. in December 2024, which is up from 5.09 MT in the previous month.\n\nThis increased demand is driven by strong winters as well as supply-related issues from Russia. Previously, Europe imported LNG through Ukraine in 2024, while it is currently seeing increasing geopolitical issues. On the other hand, Asia\u2019s LNG demand has also seen growth, making up 34% of the total LNG exports made by the U.S. in 2024. Accordingly, shipments to Asia rose to 2.01 MT in December from 1.64 MT in November (up by 24%).\n\nHowever, the industry is currently facing challenges in the form of the U.S.-China trade war, under which China imposed a 15% tariff on the U.S. LNG, as U.S. President Donald Trump put a 10% charge on Chinese imports. While long-term commitments are significant, in 2024, China\u2019s imports made up for only 5.5% (4.3 MT) of the total exports by the U.S., as per Kpler. It has been reported by Reuters that under 20-year agreements, Chinese buyers are to import 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from U.S. terminals. However, ongoing issues may curb further contracts.\n\nThus, for short-term ease, the U.S. may rely on Europe\u2019s demand, however, IEA predicts that the European gas demand will decline from 507 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 to somewhere between 281 and 407 bcm by 2035, owing to its transition to renewable energy sources. On the other hand, China\u2019s LNG demand is expected to grow and reach between 397 and 522 bcm by 2035.\n\nMoreover, advancements in technology in liquefaction and regasification have helped in improving energy efficiency and in reducing methane emissions across the supply chain. Furthermore, offshore gas extraction has been enabled by floating LNG (FLNG) with minimal onshore infrastructure, which adds to flexibility in production. The global LNG liquefaction capacity by 2028 is expected to increase from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA by 2028 with the help of new projects as per BusinessWire. The expansion will be led by North America, making up for 54% of the total capacity increase.\n\nLooking on to the other side, Australia also makes up for a key LNG player with over $126 billion invested in new and upcoming projects, as reported by Deloitte. These investments look to increase production capacity and help Australia secure long-term contracts amidst changing global demand.\n\nDespite these developments, natural gas futures prices have increased by around 98.02% in the past six months. This is an increase from $1.956 on August 26, 2024 to $4.23, as of writing this article. This reflects on the high volatility of the market as well as evolving trade flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we picked the top LNG companies having an exposure to LNG production and distribution. Furthermore, we made sure that we picked companies with strong market capitalization. Additionally, we looked into the number of hedge funds having a stake in the respective stocks, and made sure the hedge fund sentiment was positively strong for the respective stocks. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the upside potential predicted by a healthy number of analysts, as of writing this article.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The company has an extensive global portfolio in crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas. Its operations span through Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the U.S. shale basins, proving them to be a strong driving force in the LNG market.\n\nThe company reported total production of 1,987 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was a 3% year-on-year increase. Such an increase was made possible through strong output from the U.S. shale operations and higher LNG volumes.\n\nAccordingly, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\u2019s cash flow was around $21.3 billion, with support from better commodity prices and efficient capital allocation. However, the company\u2019s net income was reported to be $11.2 billion, down from $18.7 billion in 2023. This decline can be attributed to higher costs as well as expenses related to acquisitions.\n\nMoreover, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) signed a long-term regasification agreement at Belgium\u2019s Zeebrugge LNG terminal and a long-term LNG sales agreement in Asia, in order to bolster its LNG sales. They also hold stakes in LNG producing facilities in Australia and Qatar, indicating the company\u2019s strategic expansion within the LNG sector.\n\nThe company also acquired Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion in late 2024 and divested $1.3 billion at the start of 2025 to streamline its portfolio and reduce debt. The divestment includes the sale of its interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields to Shell for $735 million, expected to close by Q2 2025, as well as the sale of $600 million worth of non-core Lower 48 assets. These efforts helped the company achieve its asset disposition target of $2 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected to produce in a stable manner through 2025. It is looking to focus on high-return U.S. shale assets and LNG expansion. In light of such efforts, the company wants to hold an optimized portfolio, maintaining a strong cash flow, all set for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nOverall COP ranks 1st on our list of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Thus, for short-term ease, the U.S. may rely on Europe\u2019s demand, however, IEA predicts that the European gas demand will decline from 507 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 to somewhere between 281 and 407 bcm by 2035, owing to its transition to renewable energy sources. On the other hand, China\u2019s LNG demand is expected to grow and reach between 397 and 522 bcm by 2035.\n\nHowever, the industry is currently facing challenges in the form of the U.S.-China trade war, under which China imposed a 15% tariff on the U.S. LNG, as U.S. President Donald Trump put a 10% charge on Chinese imports. While long-term commitments are significant, in 2024, China\u2019s imports made up for only 5.5% (4.3 MT) of the total exports by the U.S., as per Kpler. It has been reported by Reuters that under 20-year agreements, Chinese buyers are to import 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from U.S. terminals. However, ongoing issues may curb further contracts.\n\nThis increased demand is driven by strong winters as well as supply-related issues from Russia. Previously, Europe imported LNG through Ukraine in 2024, while it is currently seeing increasing geopolitical issues. On the other hand, Asia\u2019s LNG demand has also seen growth, making up 34% of the total LNG exports made by the U.S. in 2024. Accordingly, shipments to Asia rose to 2.01 MT in December from 1.64 MT in November (up by 24%).\n\nIn contrast, the global market also has a major impact from Europe\u2019s LNG demand. The region\u2019s demand accounted for 55% of total LNG exports by the U.S. in 2024, according to LSEG. LNG shipments of 5.84 MT were sent to Europe by the U.S. in December 2024, which is up from 5.09 MT in the previous month.\n\nThe global market for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), with the support of secure energy and industrial demand, is looking at continued expansion. The industry is forecasted to grow from $143.35 billion in 2024 to $155.85 billion in 2025, according to The Business Research Company. This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Looking further ahead, it is expected that the LNG market will reach $205.95 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.2%, which is predominantly attributed to the global demand for cleaner energy. The demand for LNG is majorly fulfilled by the U.S., exporting around 88.3 million metric tons (MT), which is up by 4.5% from 2023, according to LSEG.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoreover, advancements in technology in liquefaction and regasification have helped in improving energy efficiency and in reducing methane emissions across the supply chain. Furthermore, offshore gas extraction has been enabled by floating LNG (FLNG) with minimal onshore infrastructure, which adds to flexibility in production. The global LNG liquefaction capacity by 2028 is expected to increase from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA by 2028 with the help of new projects as per BusinessWire. The expansion will be led by North America, making up for 54% of the total capacity increase.\n\nLooking on to the other side, Australia also makes up for a key LNG player with over $126 billion invested in new and upcoming projects, as reported by Deloitte. These investments look to increase production capacity and help Australia secure long-term contracts amidst changing global demand.\n\nDespite these developments, natural gas futures prices have increased by around 98.02% in the past six months. This is an increase from $1.956 on August 26, 2024 to $4.23, as of writing this article. This reflects on the high volatility of the market as well as evolving trade flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we picked the top LNG companies having an exposure to LNG production and distribution. Furthermore, we made sure that we picked companies with strong market capitalization. Additionally, we looked into the number of hedge funds having a stake in the respective stocks, and made sure the hedge fund sentiment was positively strong for the respective stocks. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the upside potential predicted by a healthy number of analysts, as of writing this article.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) The Best Crude Oil Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 27.39%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the top exploration and production companies. The company has an extensive global portfolio in crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas. Its operations span through Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the U.S. shale basins, proving them to be a strong driving force in the LNG market.\n\nThe company reported total production of 1,987 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was a 3% year-on-year increase. Such an increase was made possible through strong output from the U.S. shale operations and higher LNG volumes.\n\nAccordingly, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)'s cash flow was around $21.3 billion, with support from better commodity prices and efficient capital allocation. However, the company\u2019s net income was reported to be $11.2 billion, down from $18.7 billion in 2023. This decline can be attributed to higher costs as well as expenses related to acquisitions.\n\nMoreover, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) signed a long-term regasification agreement at Belgium\u2019s Zeebrugge LNG terminal and a long-term LNG sales agreement in Asia, in order to bolster its LNG sales. They also hold stakes in LNG producing facilities in Australia and Qatar, indicating the company\u2019s strategic expansion within the LNG sector.\n\nThe company also acquired Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion in late 2024 and divested $1.3 billion at the start of 2025 to streamline its portfolio and reduce debt. The divestment includes the sale of its interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields to Shell for $735 million, expected to close by Q2 2025, as well as the sale of $600 million worth of non-core Lower 48 assets. These efforts helped the company achieve its asset disposition target of $2 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected to produce in a stable manner through 2025. It is looking to focus on high-return U.S. shale assets and LNG expansion. In light of such efforts, the company wants to hold an optimized portfolio, maintaining a strong cash flow, all set for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nOverall COP ranks 1st on our list of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

A 500-metre safe navigation area will be established around the seabed survey vessels and any towed equipment.\n\nIt said seabed surveys are expected to take no more than one week at each location and will be conducted by one to two vessels. \u201cDuring drilling, a 500-metre radius petroleum safety zone and two-kilometre radius cautionary zone will be established around each well. Drilling will take typically 30 to 40 days, but no more than 90 days at each location, with the mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) supported by up to three vessels to transport equipment and provide for standby.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best crude oil stocks to buy right now.\n\nCrude oil markets have seen extreme volatility over the past year, fueled by a variety of economic, geopolitical, and supply and demand factors. Prices fell at the end of 2023, when international demand faltered and supply remained strong from key regions, before rebounding in early 2024 as leading oil-producing countries implemented supply cuts to stabilize the market. Meanwhile, demand signals have been mixed \u2014 industrial activity in major economies has improved, but high interest rates and inflationary pressures have limited overall energy consumption. After the presidential elections in the US, the Trump 2.0 agenda appears to be driving cracks in the economic outlook, due to a plethora of initiatives such as tariffs, a fight with immigration, and significant cuts in government spending. Despite Republicans notoriously being pro-business and pro-carbon, as confirmed by an announced policy of encouraging energy exploration and production on Federal land and Outer Continental Shelf, the reaction of the stock market has been mixed, as many crude oil stocks have underperformed the broad market in the last couple of months.\n\nThe reluctance of the broad market to price in an acceleration in the crude oil space is likely due to expectations of lower oil prices, primarily driven by an uncertain economic and industrial outlook. A slowing economy generally consumes less oil, which coupled with an increasing supply should put downward pressure on prices. Optimism for the year ahead vanished and the outlook has become one of the gloomiest since the pandemic. Companies started to signal widespread concerns about the impact of government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments. For instance, the US economic surprise index hit the lowest last week since September, while the business capex forecasts were abruptly cut at the beginning of the year. Small businesses reflect similar signals, by cutting their capex expectations (as per surveys), while consumers report deteriorating financial expectations going forward. All these developments don\u2019t play out in favor of a strong economy in the following quarters.\n\nFinancial markets have reflected this turbulence, as energy stocks moved in tandem with the swings in oil prices, which retracted more than 10% since the inauguration day. While refiners and midstream companies have generally performed well due to resilient transportation and processing demand, exploration and production firms have faced challenges in securing new investments. Looking forward, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors will continue to shape the crude oil market. Geopolitical factors, particularly in key oil-producing regions, remain an ongoing concern \u2013 with the end of the Ukraine conflict becoming a reality, Russian oil will likely flow more freely abroad, putting even more downward pressure on global prices. Despite the aforementioned headwinds, there are also some positive takeaways for investors \u2013 while renewable energy investments continue to grow, the transition remains gradual, ensuring that crude oil will remain a critical component of the global energy mix in the future, especially under the carbon-friendly Trump 2.0 regime. Furthermore, with oil prices declining and many crude oil stocks being down from their mid-2024 highs, the current developments may turn out to be a great long-term buying opportunity.",

Double Eagle owns 95,000 net acres in the Midland segment of the Permian Basin, and the deal could exceed $5 billion. While this amount is substantial, it is much smaller than ExxonMobil's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5 billion. While consolidation provides benefits like cost synergies and improved efficiency for the companies involved, I remain highly skeptical about its positive impact on shareholders, who typically bear the initial costs.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. oil industry saw significant consolidation, especially in the Permian Basin. This trend has continued into early 2025 as companies aim to improve operational efficiency and expand their resource portfolios. ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Diamondback Energy, EOG Resources, and Chevron have already participated in this consolidation.\n\nIn November 2024, ConocoPhillips strategically acquired Marathon Oil for $22.5 billion, including $5.4 billion in assumed debt, thereby enhancing its portfolio with high-quality, low-cost supply assets. The chart below shows a significant improvement in oil equivalent production in 4Q24, with a total output of 2,183 Kboepd, including 1,308 Kboepd from the US lower 48.\n\nHouston-based energy giant ConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) released its fourth-quarter 2024 results on February 6, 2025. This article updates my previous article on ConocoPhillips, published on June 20, 2024. The company is among the world's largest independent oil and gas producers, operating in 15 countries. In 4Q24, the US lower 48 segment accounted for 59.9% of oil equivalent production, primarily from the three most productive basins: Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken, which produced 1,240 barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe ongoing quest to become the largest producer in the U.S. is more about ego, primarily serving the interests of management rather than benefiting shareholders. In summary, being bigger is not necessarily better for shareholders. While most major U.S. producers have expanded their operations and reached record domestic production levels, their stock performance over the past few years shows little significant variation. A look at the two-year chart quickly leads to the conclusion that this growth was not worthwhile. COP is down 10% compared to two years ago and may fall even lower.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nThe outlook for oil prices in 2025 is expected to be negative, as supply is projected to exceed demand. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that the average price of Brent will decrease from $81 per barrel in 2024 to $74 in 2025. Additionally, 2025 is anticipated to be highly volatile, with significant price fluctuations. This decline and fluctuations will likely exert additional downward pressure on stock performance, prompting investors to consider a Last In, First Out (LIFO) trading strategy. It is what I am doing, and it has paid off.\n\n3: A critical analysis of the fourth quarter results: Uncertainty about 2025.\n\n3.1: Oil Equivalent Production for 4Q24: Record production achieved following the Marathon acquisition.\n\nIt is important to note that, unlike Chevron and ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips does not generate revenue from downstream or chemical operations. Instead, it is exclusively an exploration and production (E&P) company that concentrates on upstream activities such as oil and gas exploration, development, and production.ConocoPhilips' Oil equivalent production jumped significantly in 4Q24 with the Marathon oil production. Total output of 2,183 Kboepd, including 1,308 Kboepd from the US lower 48. US production represented 59.9% of the company's total output. The different sub-regions where oil and gas come from in the lower 48 are shown below.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nThe Permian Basin is the main segment, producing 833 Kboepd as indicated in 4Q24. The production includes oil, natural gas liquids (NGL), natural gas, and bitumen, with oil accounting for 49% of the total output. The liquid-to-gas ratio of 83.4% is quite exceptional.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nOil and gas prices have been declining. In 4Q24, the global average per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) reached $53.27, down from last year's $58.21. The average realized price of crude oil was $71.04 per barrel, down from the previous year's figure of $80.80. The average realized price of natural gas was $5.12 per thousand cubic feet, while the price of natural gas liquids was $23.93 per barrel.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nConocoPhillips is currently the third-largest producer of oil equivalent, with a total production of 2,183 Kboepd, including 1,308 Kboepd from the lower 48 states in 4Q24. The company's production cost was $19.18 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) for the period, which resulted in a significant profit margin. This enabled COP to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, reflecting a yield of 3.25%.Chevron, including Hess (which has not yet received clearance), is expected to be the largest producer, slightly surpassing ExxonMobil. I have also mentioned Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources, although their production figures for 4Q24 are not yet available. The total combined production for the six companies listed below is approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\n3.2: 4Q24 results analysis.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 in the fourth quarter of 2024, beating analysts' expectations. However, this was significantly lower than the prior-year level of $2.40.ConocoPhillips' quarterly revenues were $14.74 billion, down from $15.31 billion in the year-ago period. The better-than-expected quarterly earnings resulted from increased oil equivalent production, although they were partly offset by lower average realized oil equivalent prices and higher overall costs and expenses.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nI often assess a company's financial health by examining its free cash flow. The free cash flow was weak in the fourth quarter, totaling only $1.14 billion. This amount was less than half of what ConocoPhillips achieved in the previous quarter, which is concerning.\n\nConocoPhillips has announced a target to return $10 billion to shareholders by 2025. This plan includes $4 billion in dividends and $6 billion in share buybacks. In 2024, the company returned $9.1 billion to its shareholders, $5.5 billion of which came from share repurchases and $3.6 billion from ordinary dividends. This spending is well above what COP can spend based on free cash flow. We must see if COP can generate more free cash flow in 1Q25. At the pace of 4Q24, the company will generate less than $5 billion in 2025, barely covering the dividend. I encountered the same issue with ExxonMobil. The company will generate more free cash flow in 2025, alleviating my concerns. However, higher oil prices are crucial, and 2025 may not be strong enough.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\nCOP's long-term debt, including current liabilities, totals $24.324 billion, while its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities amount to $6.114 billion. The company's debt significantly increased in 4Q24 after COP assumed $5.4 billion in debt from Marathon. Additionally, COP announced that it will divest certain assets in the Permian Basin for more than $1 billion. Like we said, We can't have the cake and eat it too.\n\nConocoPhillips: Free Cash Flow Weakness May Be A Problem In 2025\n\n4: Technical Analysis. COP is weakening.\n\nNote that the chart above has been updated to reflect dividends.\n\nConocoPhillips follows a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $101 and support at $95.50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36 and is declining, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nI suggest taking profits between $99.9 and $102 for a short-term trading strategy, with a possible higher resistance at $105.85, corresponding to the 200-day moving average. Conversely, I recommend accumulating shares between $96 and $95, with an additional lower support level at $92.5 or below, depending on the oil prices.\n\nAdopting a short-term Last In, First Out (LIFO) strategy for 40% to 50% of your total position while maintaining a core long-term holding for potentially higher returns can be an effective approach. ConocoPhillips offers a solid dividend yield. Although there are short-term risks in the oil sector, your investment will likely yield substantial long-term gains if you remain patient. Therefore, keeping a significant portion of your position for the long term is important, even if you encounter temporary paper losses. The key to success is to invest in strong companies, and COP fits that description.\n\nNote that the chart above should be updated regularly to remain relevant.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

This was an especially bad environmental look when BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon platform explosion (pictured above) and subsequent oil leak disaster happened in 2010, as our Chairman Peter Flaherty wrote at the time in a post he titled \u201cBeyond Pathetic:\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s revealing that the \u201cgreenest\u201d of the big international oil companies is now responsible for one of the worst ecological disasters in history. Maybe BP should have concentrated on its core mission of efficiently and safely producing oil instead of trying to make us believe that BP stands for \u201cBeyond Petroleum.\u201d Most big companies zealously guard their brand names. British Petroleum seems embarrassed by theirs. Even as the Deepwater Horizon gushes into its 42nd day, the BP website proclaims: Our brand is summed up by the phrase \u2018beyond petroleum\u2019. BP recognises that meeting the energy challenges of today and tomorrow requires both traditional hydrocarbons and a growing range of alternatives. We are at the forefront of delivering diverse, material and real solutions to meet the world\u2019s needs for more and secure, cleaner and affordable energy. The ubiquitous and annoying Beyond Petroleum TV ads always feature windmills, a tiny corner of BP\u2019s business that shouldn\u2019t even exist. Wind energy is not economically viable, only existing because of government subsidies and tax credits. Moreover, new studies suggest that the supposed benefits of wind \u2014 reduced carbon emissions \u2014 are exaggerated or nonexistent because of the intermittency problem. Because the wind does not always blow, coal and natural gas plants must ratchet up or cut back production, creating new inefficiencies.\n\nNLPC subsequently reported in 2011 that after BP received a $7.5 million Department of Energy grant for solar four years earlier, that it still couldn\u2019t make the \u201calternative energy\u201d source profitably, so it exited the business. Then in 2013 the company dumped another useless \u201crenewable\u201d power source, announcing, \u201cBP has decided to market for sale our U.S. wind energy business as part of a continuing effort to become a more focused oil and gas company and re-position the company for sustainable growth into the future.\u201d\n\nWe had thought it ended there after BP had seemingly come to its senses, but apparently not, as more government subsidies must have come along that the company couldn\u2019t resist. According to the Wall Street Journal today:\n\nBP said it would boost oil-and-gas production and sharply cut investments in clean energy, pivoting back to fossil fuels in a bid to revive its flagging share price. The struggling British energy company announced the moves Wednesday as part of a much-anticipated strategy update aimed at winning over investors\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s a radical shift,\u201d Chief Executive Murray Auchincloss said in an interview. BP would focus on pumping more oil in the U.S., where the company is a big offshore producer, and in Middle Eastern countries including Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, he said\u2026. Since taking the helm in the fall of 2023, Auchincloss has dialed back BP\u2019s hydrogen and biofuel plans, put its onshore-wind business in the U.S. up for sale and launched a cost-cutting drive. He has also greenlighted several big oil-and-gas investments and secured quick-and-easy access to barrels in Iraq and elsewhere. Companies in sectors from oil to autos have struggled to calibrate the pace of the energy transition as governments have wavered in efforts to curb climate change. President Trump began dismantling the Biden administration\u2019s climate-focused initiatives soon after taking office in January.\n\nBP could have learned but it didn\u2019t, and therefore was doomed to repeat history.

The volume comes from ConocoPhillips\u2019 15.96 percent stake in the Ursa field and one percent interest in the Europa field.\n\nIt is also transferring to Shell its stake in Ursa Oil Pipeline Co. LLC. \u201cThe transaction also includes an overriding royalty interest in the Ursa Field\u201d, said ConocoPhillips, which acquired the royalty stake as part of its $22.5 billion merger with Marathon Oil Corp. late last year.\n\n\u201cProceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes\u201d, ConocoPhillips said.\n\nExpected to be completed in the second quarter subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction \u201cwill increase Shell\u2019s working interest in its operated Ursa platform, pipeline, and associated fields from 45.3884 percent to a maximum of 61.35 percent\u201d, Shell said separately. The maximum figure is \u201csubject to preferential rights election\u201d, Shell said.\n\nAs it stands Shell operates the Ursa development with a stake of about 45.39 percent. BP PLC owns around 22.69 percent, ECP GOM III LLC 15.96 percent and ConocoPhillips 15.96 percent.\n\nThe Ursa tension-leg platform, approximately 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, started production 1999. Located in the Mars Basin, the field produced more than 800 million barrels of oil equivalent gross over 25 years, according to Shell.\n\n\u201cThis targeted investment is the latest example of how we are unlocking more value from our existing advantaged Upstream assets and infrastructure\u201d, said Zo\u00eb Yujnovich, director for integrated gas and upstream at Shell. \u201cThe acquisition expands our ownership in an established long-producing asset that generates robust free cash flow, while also providing more options for growth\u201d.\n\nFor ConocoPhillips, \u201cthis transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting noncore assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target\u201d, said Andy O\u2019Brien, senior vice president for strategy, commercial, sustainability and technology at ConocoPhillips.\n\nAt year-end ConocoPhillips reached Lower 48 divestment agreements amounting to $600 million, toward a goal of $2 billion. It expects to complete the sales in the first half of 2025, according to its quarterly report February 6.\n\nConocoPhillips reported year-end proven reserves of 7.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent with a preliminary reserve replacement ratio of 244 percent. \u201cExcluding closed acquisitions and dispositions, the preliminary organic reserve replacement ratio was 123 percent\u201d, it said.\n\nThis year ConocoPhillips expects to produce 2.34 million boed to 2.38 MMboed.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips' ( ) recent weak earnings report didn't cause a big stock movement. Our analysis suggests that along with soft profit numbers, investors should be aware of some other underlying weaknesses in the numbers.\n\nOne essential aspect of assessing earnings quality is to look at how much a company is diluting shareholders. In fact, ConocoPhillips increased the number of shares on issue by 8.2% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. As a result, its net income is now split between a greater number of shares. Per share metrics like EPS help us understand how much actual shareholders are benefitting from the company's profits, while the net income level gives us a better view of the company's absolute size. Check out ConocoPhillips' historical EPS growth by .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Is Dilution Impacting ConocoPhillips' Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\n\nAs you can see above, ConocoPhillips has been growing its net income over the last few years, with an annualized gain of 14% over three years. Net profit actually dropped by 16% in the last year. But the EPS result was even worse, with the company recording a decline of 14%. And so, you can see quite clearly that dilution is influencing shareholder earnings.\n\nIn the long term, if ConocoPhillips' earnings per share can increase, then the share price should too. But on the other hand, we'd be far less excited to learn profit (but not EPS) was improving. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On ConocoPhillips' Profit Performance\n\nConocoPhillips issued shares during the year, and that means its EPS performance lags its net income growth. Therefore, it seems possible to us that ConocoPhillips' true underlying earnings power is actually less than its statutory profit. But at least holders can take some solace from the 28% per annum growth in EPS for the last three. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of ConocoPhillips' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

            "content": "Oil stocks can be excellent sources of passive income for investors who can stomach the volatility of the cyclical energy sector. And with oil prices down 9% or so in the last year, many oil and gas stocks have sold off even as broader indexes like the S&P 500 make new highs.\n\nConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) is the largest U.S. exploration and production (E&P) company by market capitalization and has an elite portfolio of assets that can perform well even at weaker oil prices. Here's why ConocoPhillips is a top dividend stock to buy now.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint\n\nOn Nov. 22, ConocoPhillips completed its blockbuster $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. So 2025 will mark the first full year the business will benefit from the added production. In 2024, ConocoPhillips produced 1.987 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). 2025 production is expected to be 2.34 to 2.38 million boe/d -- or 18.8% higher at the midpoint.\n\nGiven the big investment in Marathon, ConocoPhillips is more focused on reducing costs and incrementally increasing its production in the low-single digits per year rather than continuing to grow its portfolio. On the earnings call, ConocoPhillips said it plans to reduce capital spending by 15% year over year on a pro forma basis, largely thanks to material synergies from the acquisition.\n\nThe updated guidance aligns with some of the savings announced in ConocoPhillips's presentation from May 2024. In that presentation, it forecast $500 million in annual savings, lowering operating costs and allowing the company to break even at lower oil prices.\n\nIn sum, ConocoPhillips made a splash with the Marathon deal, so now it is focusing on sustaining the now much larger business rather than getting overly aggressive with its production targets.\n\nBacking long-term projects\n\nAlthough ConocoPhillips doesn't plan to grow its production rapidly post-acquisition, it is still investing in long-cycle projects. The company is forecasting $12.9 billion in 2025 capital expenditures (capex), which would be its highest in over 10 years. Granted, the company is much larger today than even five years ago before it bought Concho Resources in January 2021 and Marathon Oil.\n\nBut still, the ramp-up in capex may catch investors off guard, given oil prices are mediocre right now. On the earnings call, ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance explained why its spending will be especially large this year:\n\nWe expect 2025 to be the peak year of our long-cycle spending at around $3 billion, followed by a steady stream of project start-ups from 2026 to 2029. Once these projects are all online, we expect $3.5 billion of incremental [cash flow from operations] CFO from NFE, Port Arthur, NFS, and Willow, all combined at $70 WTI, $10 TTF, and $4 Henry Hub. And that leads to roughly $6 billion of incremental annual sustaining free cash flow relative to 2025.\n\nThese capital-intensive, longer-term projects are meant to produce steady cash flow over an extended period, which is far different from the quick-turning shale wells in the Permian Basin and other areas where ConocoPhillips produces oil and gas.\n\nReturning capital to shareholders\n\nEven with higher spending, ConocoPhillips still expects to return $10 billion to shareholders in 2025 -- $6 billion in stock repurchases and $4 billion in dividends. ConocoPhillips earned $8 billion in 2024 free cash flow (FCF). Now with a full year of Marathon's assets, the company should be able to afford most if not all of its capital return program with FCF as long as oil prices remain around their current mid-cycle levels.\n\nWhen ConocoPhillips first announced its intent to acquire Marathon in May 2024, it made a plan to buy back between $5 billion and $7 billion in stock per year once the transaction closed -- or $20 billion over three years. Since ConocoPhillips bought Marathon in an all-stock transaction, the three-year buyback program would allow the company to offset nearly the equivalent shares it issued for the acquisition.\n\nConocoPhillips is making good on that promise with its $6 billion buyback target for 2025. Last year, ConocoPhillips eliminated its variable return on cash, which was a special quarterly dividend based on the performance of the business. Now, it pays an ordinary quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. It intends to gradually raise the payout over time. Based on the stock price at the time of this writing, the yield on the ordinary dividend is 3.1%, which is good, especially considering the rapid pace of buybacks.\n\nAdd it all up, and ConocoPhillips is well-positioned to continue reducing its share count while also being a solid source of passive income.\n\nA top oil stock to buy now\n\nIn the present mid-cycle environment, ConocoPhillips can invest in long-term growth and generate strong FCF to support its sizable capital return program. With a 14.7 price-to-FCF ratio and a 12.8 price-to-earnings ratio, ConocoPhillips is an excellent value, especially for investors who believe its Marathon acquisition was the right long-term move.\n\nConocoPhillips stock is currently around a two-year low, which could be a great buying opportunity for long-term investors. However, E&Ps tend to be highly volatile and can see big swings in their stock prices based on oil prices. So, it's best to approach ConocoPhillips only if you're comfortable with the volatility.",

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFor value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: ConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is primarily involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Considering proved reserves and production, the company is among the largest explorers and producers in the world. The company, founded in 1875, has a strong presence across conventional and unconventional plays in 13 countries. ConocoPhillips\u2019 low-risk and cost-effective operations are spread across North America, Asia, Australia and Europe.\n\nCOP is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 12; value investors should take notice.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $8.16 per share. COP boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.1%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, COP should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in ConocoPhillips (COP)?\n\nBefore you invest in ConocoPhillips (COP), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "As U.S. inflation rates heat up again, investors are scurrying to store assets in traditional hedges. One of the most consistently well-performing sectors in environments of high inflation is energy, which has beaten inflation 74% of the time between the years 1973 and 2024.\n\nWith an annual real return of almost 13% on average, it\u2019s easy to see why investors are once again turning to energy stocks to combat rising prices. However, the trade-off to hedging inflation with energy stocks is usually lower rates of portfolio growth. These five unique energy stocks buck this trend, combining hedging potential with massive analyst-anticipated upsides.\n\nTons of Potential Upside for ConocoPhillips\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:COP]\n\nMultinational energy company ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) has had a rough year. Its share prices have shown a downward trend since April of 2024, with shares trading about 13% below pricing the same time last year.\n\nOperating revenue fell from 2022 to 2023, as did profits, contributing to the steady decline.\n\nDespite these recent struggles, analysts remain optimistic about ConocoPhillips long-term. It maintains a solid Buy rating, with a consensus price target of $133.56 per share.\n\nThis represents a potential upside of more than 38% \u2014 and with the company trading close to its 52-week low, now could be the right time to snatch up this energy stock.\n\nDiamondback Energy Trades Low With 37% Analyst Upside\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:FANG]\n\nDiamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) is another energy stock facing a dip in investor interest. Down 12.5% since last year, the stock is currently trading at close to a 52-week low.\n\nIt also missed its most recent earnings estimate by $1.24 per share, leading to another drop in share price seen after earnings were released in November.\n\nShort interest and analyst data present a positive future, regardless of recent negative headlines.\n\nShort interest fell by 12.42% since last month, indicating a sharp increase in investor confidence \u2014 likely attributed to increased inclusion in hedge funds like Lord & Richards Wealth Management. Analysts forecast a 37.06% potential upside for a consensus share price of $215.17 per share.\n\nPetrobras Brings the Heat With 10% Dividend Yield\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:PBR]\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for international energy exposure, consider Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (NYSE: PBR). Steadily declining earnings have caused Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro (\u201cPetrobras\u201d) to see declining share prices since March \u2014 but this high-payout pick could mean opportunities for investors with higher risk tolerance.\n\nPetrobras currently maintains a Moderate Buy rating from analysts, with a 27.17% potential upside predicted by analysts. In particular, this energy service provider is notable for its sky-high dividend yield of 10.39%.\n\nWhile this means it pays out 23.06% of its cash flow as dividends, a recently announced discovery of fresh oil in the Buzios field could potentially support a rally without cutting payouts.\n\nCoterra Energy Enjoys Trend of Rising Share Prices\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:CTRA]\n\nUnlike the other energy picks on our list, Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE: CTRA) hasn\u2019t produced a negative return for one-year investors. Instead, share prices have been up 11.61% since last year, providing investors with optimism while still leaving room for growth.\n\nAnalysts predict a 21.33% potential upside, with a consensus price of $33.42 per share.\n\nIn addition to positive price trends, short interest and dividend increases may also act as future predictors of success. Short interest on the stock is down more than 15% since last month, indicating a sharp increase in investor confidence.\n\nWhile this stock\u2019s dividend yield is modest at 3.05%, its respectable 23.59% annualized three-year payout growth could make it a strong long-term pick.\n\nBuffett Favorite OXY Offers Reward Potential\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:OXY]\n\nFor a more risky energy play, consider Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which is trading near a new 52-week low. While analysts give this stock a tentative Hold rating, they also pair it with a 28.24% potential upside.\n\nThis optimistic valuation could be related to recent decreases in share prices, which came after institutional investors like Rhumbline Advisers and Strategic Financial Concepts announced share reductions.\n\nCompany fundamentals remain solid despite reductions, including a P/E ratio of 12.53 and an annualized three-year dividend growth rate of more than 180%. Warren Buffett holds 27% of OXY shares.\n\nThese factors could make OXY a dividend and energy pick to watch.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"These 5 Energy Stocks Hedge Inflation With Growth Potential\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

You\u2019ve done it again\u2014bought more of the problem while pretending to be part of the solution.\n\nIn the latest episode of \u201cShell Expands Its Empire of Environmental Destruction,\u201d ConocoPhillips has announced it will be offloading its interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields to\u2014wait for it\u2014Shell, for the bargain price of $735 million. Because nothing says \u201cstreamlining\u201d quite like selling off oil fields to one of the most notorious polluters on the planet.\n\nConocoPhillips, fresh from its $22.5 billion corporate feeding frenzy\u2014also known as its takeover of Marathon Oil\u2014is now frantically shedding \u201cnon-core\u201d assets to help lower its debt. It recently offloaded some Lower 48 assets for a casual $600 million, and now, Shell gets to expand its death grip on fossil fuel production.\n\n\u201cThis transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting non-core assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,\u201d said ConocoPhillips in a statement that essentially translates to: \u201cWe\u2019re selling to the highest bidder and calling it strategy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Shell\u2014always the reliable villain in any climate horror story\u2014was thrilled at the deal. After the sale, Shell\u2019s working interest in Ursa will jump from 45.4% to 61.35%. That\u2019s right, Shell just bought an even bigger share of a decades-old oil asset because, as the company puts it, it \u201cgenerates robust free cash flow, while also providing more options for growth.\u201d\n\nAh yes, \u201cgrowth\u201d\u2014a lovely euphemism for more oil extraction, more carbon emissions, and more profits for investors like BlackRock and Vanguard, who continue to bankroll climate catastrophe while insisting they\u2019re all about sustainability.\n\nShell may dress up its acquisitions with buzzwords like \u201cportfolio expansion\u201d and \u201ccash flow optimization,\u201d but at its core, this deal is just another move in the fossil fuel empire\u2019s relentless pursuit of profit. The world may be in crisis, but Shell\u2019s got shareholders to please, and if that means acquiring more assets to squeeze every last drop of oil out of the Earth, so be it.\n\nSo, congratulations, Shell. You\u2019ve done it again\u2014bought more of the problem while pretending to be part of the solution. What\u2019s next? A \u201ccommitment to sustainability\u201d press release while ramping up production?

            "content": "During his 10-year career at ConocoPhillips, Jonathan has tackled a variety of complex technical challenges. His expertise spans water treatment and reuse, heat transfer, and process engineering,\n\nProcess engineers like Jonathan are problem solvers, progressive builders and inventive thinkers. They design and optimize ConocoPhillips\u2019 facilities and plants to ensure they run safely and efficiently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed making things and conducting science experiments,\u201d said Jonathan, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from The University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 2010. \u201cIf you\u2019re excited about something, it\u2019s not a chore to work on it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re excited about something, it\u2019s not a chore to work on it\u2019 Jonathan Kiesewetter\n\nFrom Australia to Canada\n\nAfter graduating from UNSW, Jonathan joined CH2M Hill, working first in Sydney and then in Winnipeg, focusing on water treatment and wastewater management projects.\n\nYears later, while in Calgary, Jonathan met with Greta Zornes, a former colleague from CH2M Hill in Sydney who had since joined ConocoPhillips, to discuss a job opportunity at ConocoPhillips.\n\nConocoPhillips\u2019 bitumen resources at Surmont are produced using Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technology. SAGD involves injection of steam into the reservoir, liquefying the heavy bitumen, which then is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing.\n\nIt was only after meeting with Greta that Jonathan gained a deeper understanding of both the similarities and the unique challenges related to water treatment in the oil and gas industry. His expertise in water management and engineering made him an ideal candidate, and it was an opportunity he could not resist. He joined ConocoPhillips Canada in October of 2014, starting as a process engineer supporting Surmont.\n\nBased in Calgary, Jonathan joined the oil sands technology and optimization group for Surmont. He focused on optimizing steam generation and water treatment at the asset, where steam is used to melt the viscous bitumen into an emulsion that is about 75 percent water.\n\n\u201cWe separate the water out of this emulsion, then we treat the water so we can generate steam with it and then reinject it into the ground,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cProduced water treatment is a critical component of the Surmont facility, occupying a large fraction of the facility footprint.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Jonathan moved into a new role at Surmont CPF1 as a contact engineer. He played a pivotal role in supporting the day-to-day operations of the central process facility and its wells and pipelines, honing his skills in troubleshooting and contributing to a variety of dynamic projects.\n\nPioneering developments at Montney\n\nBuilding on his experience at Surmont, Jonathan transitioned to the company\u2019s liquids-rich Montney asset in 2019. There, he focused on process engineering and water treatment for its gas plant, joining in time to contribute to the final design stages of the first phase of the Montney facilities.\n\nThe Montney Central Processing Facility services ConocoPhillips Canada's Montney asset, a liquids-rich unconventional play in northeastern British Columbia.\n\nWith Jonathan\u2019s extensive background in water treatment, his transition couldn't have come at a more opportune moment. At this time, ConocoPhillips water expert Ramesh Sharma was in the midst of designing and building a water treatment facility for the C-11-K gas plant, based off learnings from the Permian Basin. The water treatment facility maximizes water recycling by treating and storing produced water for reuse in completions, reducing the amount of fresh water required for the development. Jonathan had the opportunity to witness and contribute to the final stages of the facility\u2019s design, commissioning and startup.\n\n\"It was awesome to see it all come to life,\" Jonathan said.\n\nIn addition, Jonathan learned about the completions process used on the Montney wells, working with Completions Fluid Specialist Paul Carman in GTF on friction reducer selection.\n\n\u201cThe selection of completions chemistry has a big influence on how to treat the flowback and produced water from the wells,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nAs part of those learnings, Jonathan, Ramesh and Paul co-submitted a patent application detailing how friction reducer chemistry impacts water chemistry and treatability. They also outlined methods for treating produced water contaminated with specific friction reducers.\n\nMontney condensate recovery unit\n\nMoreover, Jonathan collaborated with Principal Process and Modeling Engineer Dale Embry and other professionals to develop the condensate recovery unit (CRU) at Montney. This facility transforms off-specification condensate into valuable, marketable products using distillation and blending of cuts.\n\n\u201cWe successfully patented that process,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cLate last year, that patent was officially approved. Over the span of about three years, we were able to go from a concept development and simulation exercise to actually seeing it built and operational.\u201d\n\nUnlike most field facilities that typically produce only gas and oil or natural gas liquids (NGL), the Montney C-11-K facility stands out by generating gas, NGL and a dense condensate stream. Due to stringent product quality requirements for condensate, the CRU was developed to fractionate the stabilized dense condensate into a light oil and sales condensate stream, both meeting required product quality specifications for sale into their respective product pools. The CRU process adds complexity and additional pretreatment processes beyond those seen at a typical gas plant, such as desalting and overhead corrosion management processes, but has been successful in mitigating product quality constraints that posed a risk to the Montney development.\n\nAs Jonathan was wrapping up the CRU project, he transitioned to the GTF organization in Houston in May 2023. \u201cMy role in GTF has been an incredible opportunity to branch out, understand how the company operates globally, and share my insights across various business units,\u201d he said.\n\nCollaborating with the Global Water Sustainability Center\n\nAs part of his GTF duties, Jonathan has been collaborating with the Global Water Sustainability Center (GWSC) team in Doha, Qatar, a team led by GWSC Manager Samer Adham. Together, they are evaluating various novel solutions and emerging technologies to enhance water treatment and recycling across multiple ConocoPhillips operations, including the Permian and Montney.\n\nThe Global Water Sustainability Center team is known for its specialized expertise and progressing water-related technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the new technologies we\u2019ve introduced this year,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cOur focus now is on boosting their technology readiness level and figuring out the best ways to scale them up for broader application.\u201d\n\nAdham praised Jonathan\u2019s dedication and enthusiasm for his work, highlighting the process engineer\u2019s technical expertise in water management and treatment.\n\n\"Our collaborations with Jonathan also involve partnering with academic institutions to ensure their experiments are conducted under relevant field conditions,\u201d Adham said, \u201cmaximizing the applicability of their research to ConocoPhillips\u2019 operations.\u201d\n\nThis work involves exploring ways to expand the use of treated produced water beyond the oil and gas industry, aiming to unlock new possibilities and applications for this resource.\n\nJonathan with Permian Water Project Integration Manager Luis Baez and Senior Water Production Engineer Ana-Paula Maynard at Texas Tech University in Lubbock in February 2025. ConocoPhillips is partnering with the university to conduct research on produced water desalination.\n\nModel rockets and home-brewing adventures\n\nJonathan and family\n\nIn his spare time, Jonathan has rekindled his love for building model rockets, now sharing this exciting hobby with his 6-year-old son. It's a passion he first discovered while attending a Rudolf Steiner School in Sydney, where he excelled in mathematics and chemistry. Additionally, Jonathan continues to indulge in his long-time hobby of brewing beer, a craft he\u2019s been passionate about since his university days.\n\nHe\u2019s also embarked on an inspiring new water-related challenge: reef aquarium keeping. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress. The fish are thriving, but it\u2019s definitely a challenge. It\u2019s like mastering a whole new realm of chemistry.\u201d",

That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $60 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ConocoPhillips shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ConocoPhillips is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Top 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.91 per share to $2.06 in that period.\n\n\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about ConocoPhillips right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

            "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nDuring President Trump\u2019s first term in office, oil and gas companies made headlines for opposing his efforts to rollback methane safeguards. ExxonMobil CEO, Darren Woods, quickly jumped into the spotlight to announce the company\u2019s public opposition to Trump\u2019s rollbacks. Then, as the Biden Administration took over the White House, Exxon Vice President Staale Gjervik publicly declared that their support for the direct regulation of methane emissions \u201chasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nWell\u2026 it seems like that has changed. However, Exxon isn\u2019t being so loud about its feelings this time, and neither are its peers. Now, when we are on the verge of a climate catastrophe, the industry that brought us to the edge isn\u2019t just silent; they are quietly pushing us over the edge.\n\nIn October of 2024, the Washington Post revealed that the American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), a key industry group lead by oil giants like ExxonMobil, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, had devised a plan to reverse existing methane pollution safeguards so that they can pour more climate-warming methane emissions into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, these companies all claim to be taking action to reduce their methane emissions.\n\nWith Trump in office, AXPC and friends are moving quickly to bring their plan to life.\n\nLast week, Republican members of Congress introduced a Congressional Review Act resolution (CRA) to repeal an Environmental Protection Agency rule. That rule requires oil and gas companies to improve their methane emissions reporting and assess a fee only on the largest polluters (those emitting 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent or more per year) who are not abiding by the new methane standards. The fee is known as the Waste Emission Charge (WEC). This methane fee is a commonsense measure to cut excessive and easily avoidable waste, protect public health from harmful pollution, and hold the largest oil and gas polluters accountable.\n\nSee Earthworks statement on the bill.\n\nIronically, AXPC\u2019s leaked documents (uncovered and published by the amazing folks at Field Notes) reveals that its member companies weren\u2019t being honest when it came to their own public pledges to reduce methane emissions. The leaked documents included a confidential survey of member companies showing that nine out of the 19 companies that responded increased methane flaring between 2021 and 2023. Additionally, the total amount of flaring across the companies increased by 20% from 2022 to 2023. AXPC\u2019s 28 members represent more than half of U.S. on-shore oil and gas production and, based on these admissions, it\u2019s reasonable to assume they represent at least half of the pollution that comes from oil and gas production.\n\nWe know that voluntary measures to reduce methane emissions are not enough. AXPC\u2019s documents further prove that while its members talk a lot about climate ambitions, they are doing something entirely different inside their companies. These empty words are unacceptable, and have dangerous consequences for our climate and public health.\n\nYou cannot claim that your company is working to reduce its own methane emissions while also being part of a trade association that is actively trying to roll back methane emissions standards. Yet, many companies are. And, if oil and gas executives are worried about the costs of the fees they might be assessed, I\u2019d like to remind them that being in a trade group isn\u2019t cheap. AXPC members pay more than $250,000 in dues, annually.\n\nNow more than ever we need rules like the Waste Emissions Charge to hold oil and gas companies accountable to what they have already promised to do. We must demand real, measurable change and there must be consequences when those demands are not met.\n\nWe know that AXPC members can\u2019t be trusted to do the right thing which is why we worked hard for sound policy to reduce some of the harms that communities face from methane and other dangerous pollutants. We are calling on Congress to hold the line and preserve commonsense policy that will make the worst polluters pay.",

However, AI and new technologies could help drive productivity higher, though it will take time to see noticeable results.\n\nDespite these challenges, 2025 will be about navigating turbulent times, with a clear gap between the high-tech, high-productivity US economy and Europe, which is lagging behind. Policy focus is shifting from monetary to fiscal, with China taking the lead on new initiatives. Stocks, especially in the United States, remain a strong opportunity for growth, while European equities offer potential despite economic struggles.\n\nIn Q4 2024, S&P Global reported that US domestic stocks saw a net dividend increase of $11.7 billion, which was lower than the $13.7 billion increase in the same quarter last year. Overall, dividend increases totaled $14.2 billion for the quarter, which was down from $17.5 billion in Q4 2023. For the entire year, dividends grew by $53.3 billion, a significant jump from the previous year\u2019s $36.5 billion. On a per-share basis, the broader market\u2019s dividends hit a record, growing by 6% to $19.81 per share. In Q4 last year, there were 635 dividend increases, which is a 10.2% decrease compared to the 707 increases in Q4 2023.\n\nOver the past 12 months, total dividend increases amounted to $71.4 billion, up from $65.1 billion in the previous year. Interestingly, the number of companies cutting dividends decreased by 19.5% in Q4, with only 33 companies lowering their payouts, compared to 41 the year before. Here, we discuss some of the best cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 3% and P/E ratios under 15. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the dividend yield as of February 17. We have also mentioned the P/E ratios and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nDividend Yield as of February 17: 3.24%\n\nP/E Ratio: 12.41\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a Houston-based energy company that produces and distributes crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It ranks 13th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy, with a dividend yield of 3.24% as of February 17.\n\nOn February 10, Raymond James downgraded ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) from Strong Buy to Outperform and cut its price target from $157 to $124. This comes despite the company outpacing Q4 expectations, with earnings 8% higher than analysts predicted and production beating forecasts, given the solid growth in the Lower 48 states. The recent Marathon Oil acquisition is already paying off, reflected in a leaner 2025 capex forecast of under $13 billion. That said, Q1 2025 production might take a slight hit due to weather and maintenance slowdowns. Still, Raymond James sees COP as one of the best-run exploration and production companies out there, with a solid global asset portfolio and an attractive valuation.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) expects 2025 to be its biggest year for long-cycle spending, hitting around $3 billion. After that, a wave of new projects will come online from 2026 to 2029, adding about $3.5 billion in extra cash flow from key developments like NFV Port Arthur, NFS, and Willow. This should raise annual free cash flow by roughly $6 billion compared to 2025. On the shareholder front, COP is set to return $10 billion this year, $4 billion in dividends, and $6 billion in buybacks. The plan is to repurchase all the shares issued for the Marathon Oil deal within two to three years, even if oil prices dip.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 data, 66 hedge funds were long ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry\u2019s Eagle Capital Management was the biggest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.6 billion.\n\nOverall COP ranks 13th on our list of the cheap high dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Aligning with the country\u2019s broader goals of reaching 2 million barrels per day (bpd), these efforts will see ConocoPhillips prioritize collaboration, work-over programs and pipeline integrity.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Energy Capital & Power at the Libya Energy & Economic Summit (LEES) 2025, Sanner explained that the focus will be on developing previously-discovered deposits.\n\n\u201cOur strategy is to increase production at Waha. The reason for that is because there is a lot of remaining potential and it is the easiest way [to produce oil] drilling-wise. We have done a tremendous job in 2024 with a significant increase through the drilling programs and work-over programs. In terms of exploration, there is already so much that has already been discovered. So, our focus is on what has already been discovered,\u201d he said.\n\nSanner believes that Waha will be a major contributor to achieving the 2 million bpd target put forward by the government.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do in terms of pipeline integrity. We are currently producing 375,000 barrels. It can potentially hold another 50,000 barrels, but in time, Waha can reach between 600,000 and 700,000 barrels,\u201d Sanner explained.\n\nBeyond production growth, ConocoPhillips is strengthening local content by integrating local Libyans in its operations. Sanner said that, \u201cOver time, we plan to introduce more people into Waha so that we can help Libyans by embedding them in our global operations.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best natural gas stocks to buy now.\n\nThe United States of America is the Top Natural Gas Producing Country in the World, courtesy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, notably in shale, sandstone, carbonate, and other tight geologic formations. The country\u2019s dry natural gas production reached 103.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2023, up 4.3% from 2022 and the highest for any year on record, dating back to 1930, according to 2023 Natural Gas Annual. The US was also a net exporter of natural gas for the seventh consecutive year in 2023, transporting gas to 42 countries during the year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Stocks to Buy in 2025\n\nAfter a stellar 2023, the US natural gas output slumped slightly last year due to prices falling to multi-decade lows, but production is expected to climb to 104.5 bcfd in 2025, as a period of strong demand and improved prices spark a resurgence in production. Analysts expect average annual gas prices to increase by more than 40% this year over the levels seen in 2024, as demand is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The demand surge is largely attributed to new LNG export facilities, like Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3, coming online, while the Golden Pass LNG project is also anticipated to begin operations by mid-2026.\n\nEurope remains a top destination for American liquified natural gas. The continent has had to rely significantly more on imported LNG and less on gas delivered via pipelines from Russia since the Putin government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The American LNG sector is also set to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month to lift a freeze on new US licenses to export liquefied natural gas, making good on a campaign pledge to rescind the measure.\n\nThe country\u2019s natural gas sector is also expected to benefit significantly from the ongoing AI boom and the accompanying data centers, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. According to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights, if even a quarter of the projected data center load is supplied by gas-fired generation, this would translate to a 2% increase in total US gas demand in 2040.\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, surging by over 6% in November before declining around 10% in December. However, the broader energy sector (roughly 1/3rd of which is made up of natural gas companies) ended last year with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the natural gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nRanked at number 3 in our list of the Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy is ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), one of the world\u2019s largest independent E&P companies based on oil and natural gas production and proved reserves. Headquartered in Texas, the company explores for, produces, transports, and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and LNG on a worldwide basis.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) delivered a strong performance in 2024 as it increased its total production by 4% YoY and closed the $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon in late November, which added high-quality, low-cost supply inventory to its portfolio. The company also returned $9.1 billion of capital to its shareholders during the year, representing 45% of its operating cash flow and well above the 30% commitment. CP remains committed to its shareholders and announced a target to return $10 billion in 2025, assuming current commodity prices. The company has also declared its ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share for Q1 of 2025 and boasts a dividend yield of 3.22% as of February 13, 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is committed to reducing its carbon footprint, having achieved the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard designation in 2024. The company\u2019s medium-term targets include reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 50 to 60% by 2030 and achieving a near-zero methane emissions intensity by the end of the decade.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 3rd on our list of best natural gas stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for COP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOver the past year, the market has highlighted the importance of diversifying portfolios to manage risk. Selecting stocks that perform well under various economic conditions has consistently been a challenge for investors, as strategies that work in one market may not work in another. For instance, growth and value stocks have shown different performance trends in various market conditions, making both approaches appealing to investors. Combining elements of both strategies can provide a refreshing alternative to traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes into play. Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) is an investment strategy that focuses on finding companies with strong, sustainable earnings growth and appealing valuations in relation to their growth potential. These companies are often in sectors with positive growth trends or have competitive advantages that position them for future success.\n\nThe GARP strategy, popularized by Peter Lynch, aims to strike a balance between growth and value investing by avoiding the extremes of either approach. It focuses on finding growth stocks that have relatively low price-to-earnings ratios under typical market conditions. When these stocks are identified successfully, they can offer strong returns for investors. Historically, the GARP Index has outperformed its benchmark by tracking companies that demonstrate consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuations, and strong earnings potential.\n\nALSO READ: 10 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now\n\nThe strategy has gained popularity not just in the US, but also globally. After Global X launched the first global broad-based index exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Australia using the GARP framework in September 2024, the strategy delivered strong early-stage performance. According to a Global X report, while global equity markets experienced a rally towards the end of 2024, the GARP stocks outperformed the broader market and other factors like quality, rising approximately 20% since the ETF\u2019s launch. The report also noted that GARP\u2019s success wasn\u2019t driven by technology, but rather by broader sectors such as consumer goods, financials, and communication.\n\nAnalysts globally are also advocating for the GARP strategy. For instance, Brian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital, recommended that Canadian investors adopt the GARP approach this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the market, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that the GARP Index delivered an average annual return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 9.81% growth. Over the same period, the market\u2019s Growth Index and the Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also highlighted that the GARP Index achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to both the growth and value indices during this time frame.\n\nA CNBC report also highlighted insights from BMO\u2019s analysts regarding investment strategies to navigate market uncertainties in the U.S. According to the report, investors should consider the GARP approach alongside dividend growth strategies in the current financial landscape. Dividend stocks have historically performed well during inflationary periods, making them a favored choice among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this article, we used the GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked 10 dividend companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The resource base represents the company\u2019s strong footprint in prolific acres in the United States, comprising Eagle Ford shale, the Permian Basin and Bakken shale. COP boasted that its drilling and completion activities are becoming more efficient in all key U.S. basins.\n\nCompared with composite stocks belonging to the industry, the leading upstream energy company has considerably lower exposure to debt capital. This reflects that COP is better positioned to rely on its strong balance sheet to withstand any adverse business scenario.\n\nRisks to the COP\u2019s Business\n\nBeing an upstream energy player, the company\u2019s overall operations are exposed to oil and natural gas price volatility. Other exploration and production players that are also exposed to commodity price volatility are EOG Resources EOG, Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG and Matador Resources Company MTDR.\n\nIn the United States, EOG Resources is one of the foremost explorers and producers of oil and gas, with crude reserves across the United States and Trinidad.\n\nDiamondback Energy, a leading pure-play Permian operator, reported ongoing enhancements in the average productivity per well in the Midland Basin. Thus, the exploration and production company will likely continue witnessing increased production volumes.\n\nMatador Resources is a well-known exploration and production company with a strong footprint in the prolific Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the oil-rich Delaware Basin.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Energy Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other most promising energy stocks according to analysts.\n\nWith the world pivoting towards cleaner energy sources and facing political uncertainties, 2025 can be a critical year for the broader energy sector. As per GlobalData\u2019s Power Predictions 2025 report, numerous themes are expected to shape the global power landscape in 2025. These include geopolitical shifts influencing supply chains, developments in EVs, energy storage, hydrogen, and nuclear power. As per the Short-Term Energy Outlook released by the US Energy Information Administration, the generation in the US electric power sector is expected to increase by 2% in 2025 and by 1% in 2026, after rising 3% last year, driven by growth in renewable energy sources.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for the US Energy Sector?\n\nAs per AXA Investment Managers, the combination of increased demand and supply constraints resulted in a favourable backdrop for the broader US renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the lower cost and environmental benefits of renewable energy are some positive factors. Trump\u2019s return to the White House kicked off with several executive orders. Apart from announcing a national energy emergency, he ordered the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change and rolled back the clean energy initiatives.\n\nDespite such announcements, AXA Investment Managers expects the US clean energy sector to have potential investment opportunities, considering the increasing power demand. The US power demand growth remained weak between 2000 and 2020, averaging 1%. However, it is projected to increase from 2024 onwards. As per the investment management firm, a 2% \u2013 3% increase in the growth rate per annum will be significant, reflecting a doubling or tripling of the historical rate. The overall US power demand can grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2020 and 2040, against 0.1% between 2010 and 2020. This higher demand will be supportive of the long-term trend, with potential investment opportunities, from power companies to the ones involved in the energy and equipment supply chain.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nTrump\u2019s Deregulation To Be a Critical Growth Factor\n\nOne of the President\u2019s priorities revolves around reducing government bureaucracy and inefficiency. Notably, permitting new energy projects remained slow over the past few years because of understaffed government departments and burdensome environmental criteria, opines AXA Investment Managers. In an executive order on \u201cunleashing American energy\u201d, Donald Trump is focusing on reducing official rules and processes that seem unnecessary, and accelerating energy projects, constraining the remit of the NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act). Interestingly, most of the permit requirements stem from this act.\n\nOverall, economics, growth and a continued climate of innovation and competition hint at the robust US power demand, which can also support the prospects of clean energy and its supply chains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Most Promising Energy Stocks According to Analysts, we used a screener to find companies catering to the energy sector. Next, we chose the ones that analysts see the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 12. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 30.0%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a leading energy player as it is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies focusing on crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Analyst Suvro Sarkar from DBS reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, providing a price objective of $130.00. The rating is backed by several factors highlighting ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\u2019s strong operational performance and strategic growth initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) remains focused on expanding its low-cost portfolio by improving its drilling efficiency and acquiring strategic assets. Some of the notable acquisitions consist of Concho Resources and Shell\u2019s Permian assets, cementing its position in the prolific Permian Basin. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) continues to advance its LNG strategy with key projects and agreements globally. Elsewhere, Truist Securities maintained a positive stance, with analyst Neal Dingmann reiterating a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and a target of $139.00.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected to sustain single-digit production growth and significant reductions in capital expenditures with the help of improved operational efficiencies. The analyst also highlighted that the company is well-placed to refine its portfolio by planning ~$2 billion in asset sales. This move focuses on enhancing the quality of its assets.\n\nOverall, COP ranks 7th on our list of most promising energy stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide.

            "content": "The American LNG sector is expected to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month for the country to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects, reversing a pause on permits for new projects that former President Joe Biden put in place early last year to study the environmental and economic effects of the booming export industry. Several key LNG importers from Asia have hailed the move as a necessary step for maintaining their energy security and decarbonizing their energy systems in the long run. Even just a few days ago, after a round of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump announced that Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of new shipments of American LNG.\n\nAnother point to note is that the United States is now capable of exporting LNG at such historic levels without impacting supplies to its own people. The US natural gas output stands near an all-time high and nearly 90% of it remains available for domestic consumption. At the same time, natural gas prices for American households continue to be among the lowest in the world.\n\nThe United States of America is the largest LNG exporter in the world, with 88.3 million tons shipped in 2024, up 4.5% from the previous year. Europe remains the top destination for American LNG, which has replaced nearly half of the Russian gas supply to the continent after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Although last year was marked by slow growth, these numbers are expected to receive a significant 15% boost in 2025 due to several new projects coming online, notably the Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects. These expansions could pay big dividends for the country\u2019s LNG-focused companies, given the demand grows as predicted and prices stay attractive. On their current trajectory, the ballooning LNG exports would support nearly half a million domestic jobs annually and contribute $1.3 trillion to US GDP through 2040 while having a negligible impact on domestic gas prices, according to figures from S&P Global.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been reduced to a liquid state through a process of cooling, making it easier, safer, and more efficient to store and ship around the world. The global LNG trade has skyrocketed over the last few years and reached 404 million metric tons in 2023, with demand to rise by another 50% by 2040.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Stocks to Buy in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other liquefied natural gas stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPaul Everingham, CEO of Asia Natural Gas and Energy Association (ANGEA), stated the following after the resumption of LNG export approvals in the United States:\n\n\u201cA recent study by Wood Mackenzie, commissioned by ANGEA, found that Asia\u2019s LNG demand would nearly double between now and 2050, driven largely by significant growth in demand from South and Southeast Asia. The study also forecast that the United States would make up a third of global LNG supply by 2035. However, both LNG demand growth from emerging Asia and the ability of the US to meet it, were contingent on the \u2018pause\u2019 being lifted and sufficient US supply being available in coming decades to moderate global prices and ensure that LNG was affordable for nations in South and Southeast Asia. Today\u2019s issuing by President Trump of an order to resume processing of LNG export approvals will enable key projects to proceed and give decision and policy makers in Asia the certainty they require to make long-term decisions about energy. Emerging economies in Asia seek to switch out high-emitting coal use for more gas-fired power as they pursue sensible and well-planned growth in renewable energy sources. The resumption of LNG export approvals in the US will help make this a reality.\u201d\n\nThat said, a recent headwind for the American LNG industry has emerged in the form of a burgeoning trade war between the US and China, with American gas exporters caught in the crossfire. China, the largest LNG importer in the world as well as the fastest-growing LNG market globally, was seen as a key growth market for American LNG until President Trump slapped an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports earlier this month. This move was followed by Beijing announcing its own retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US, including a 15% tariff on American LNG. Though the two countries are not highly dependent on each other in the LNG arena, with China accounting for only 5% of US LNG exports last year, these numbers are not expected to surge anytime soon if the current political landscape remains the same.\n\nA possible solution could be directing even more liquified natural gas to Europe, especially after buyers there look to replenish depleted inventories following a relatively cold winter, but that is also a short-term fix. The continent\u2019s appetite for gas is expected to decline over the long term, given its strong commitments to reduce carbon emissions by shifting to renewables.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies operating in the liquified natural gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 of 2024. Following are the Best LNG Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) The Best Energy Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nAs one of the world's largest independent E&P companies, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) manages a diverse portfolio of gas flow operations. The company also has a 60-year history of leadership in LNG and LNG technology.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) managed to substantially increase its production in Q4 2024, rising 14.8% YoY to 2,183 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, the declining international prices took their toll and COP\u2019s average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent fell to $52.37, down from the previous year. As a result, the company reported a revenue of $14.7 billion, down 3.72% YoY but still beating analysts\u2019 estimates by over $514 million. COP still remains committed to its shareholders and distributed $9.1 billion in 2024 through dividends and share buybacks. The company has significantly enhanced its ability to produce cash by closing its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon in late November and aims to return $10 billion in 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has also progressed its LNG strategy through additional regasification and sales agreements in Europe and Asia. The company owns interests in LNG production facilities in Qatar and Australia and also signed a deal last year to book long-term capacity at the Fluxys-operated Zeebrugge LNG import terminal in Belgium.\n\nShares of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were held by 66 hedge funds at the end of Q3 2024, with Fisher Asset Management holding the largest stake valued at over $1.36 billion.\n\nOverall COP ranks 2nd on our list of the best liquefied natural gas stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Its descendant companies were Marathon Petroleum Corporation, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, engaged in the refining and distribution of automotive fuel, engine oil, and other petroleum products; and Marathon Oil Corporation, headquartered in Houston , Texas , engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil , natural gas , and oil sands . In 2024 Marathon Oil Corporation was acquired by rival oil company ConocoPhillips .\n\nEarly history and growth\n\nMarathon Oil, founded in Lima, Ohio, in 1887 as the Ohio Oil Company, came under the control of the Standard Oil Trust in 1889. In 1905 it moved its headquarters to Findlay. When the Standard Oil combine was broken up by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911, the company again became independent. Formerly only an oil producer, it expanded into refining while it also purchased oil fields beyond Ohio.\n\nIn 1930 Ohio Oil bought the Transcontinental Oil Company, which had producing fields in Texas, and it adopted Transcontinental\u2019s Marathon brand name and trademark long-distance Greek runner for its retail products. Ohio Oil finally adopted the name Marathon Oil Company in 1962. It operated mainly in North America, with some production in Libya and Nigeria and additional refining and wholesaling in Europe.\n\nThe USX years, split, and ConocoPhillips acquisition\n\nMarathon became a subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation in 1982 and in 1986 was reorganized, with U.S. Steel, as part of USX Corporation. In 1990 the company moved its headquarters to Houston. Marathon increased its scope and market share in 1998 by combining some of its operations with Ashland Inc. In 2001 U.S. Steel was separated from USX, and the following year USX was renamed Marathon Oil Corporation.\n\nMarathon embarked on a decade of expansion, acquiring companies such as the Russian Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation in 2003 and Canadian Western Oil Sands Inc. in 2007; it also produced oil and gas in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn 2011 the company split into two publicly held companies:\n\nMarathon Oil Corporation controlled all upstream operations, including exploration and production.\n\ncontrolled all upstream operations, including exploration and production. Marathon Petroleum Corporation controls all downstream operations, including refining and marketing.\n\nIn May 2024 rival oil company ConocoPhillips announced a deal to acquire Marathon Oil in a deal valued at $22.5 billion. The acquisition closed in November of that year. Marathon Petroleum continues to operate as an independent company, with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MPC.",

            "content": "The global economy remains strong, driven by high demand for fossil fuels despite inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\nEnergy stocks, such as ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Equinor ASA, saw significant declines, with Equinor down nearly 6%.\n\nA potential geopolitical shift emerged as Brent oil futures fell over 2% following President Trump\u2019s offer to mediate between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to initiate peace talks could lead to a ceasefire, stabilizing Black Sea oil routes and calming global markets.\n\nThe consumer price index rose by 3%, raising concerns about inflation and prompting a shift to safer investments.\n\nDespite temporary market fluctuations, the enduring demand for oil persists, with historical trends showing resilience in oil stocks post-corrections.\n\nThe tapestry of the global economy has remained vibrant, pulsing with strong demand for fossil fuels amidst inflationary threats and geopolitical tensions. Yet, this week unveiled a surprising twist. On a day habitually driven by the rhythm of oil prices, the market saw an unexpected shift. Investors swiftly withdrew from energy giants like Conoco Phillips and ExxonMobil, whose stocks dipped by approximately 3%. Even more staggering was Equinor ASA\u2019s nearly 6% decline, revealing the delicate balance teetering within the energy sector.\n\nThe catalyst? A whisper of peace. Brent oil futures, the quintessential gauge for \u201cblack gold\u201d enthusiasts, dwindled over 2%, hinting at a potentially transformative geopolitical change. In a move that shocked many, President Trump volunteered as a broker, initiating contact with both President Putin and President Zelensky. The ensuing dialogue, marked by Trump\u2019s announcement of forthcoming negotiations, suggested an embryonic step toward peace in the Ukraine conflict. A ceasefire could stabilize the Black Sea oil routes, soothing global markets and lowering prices.\n\nSimultaneously, energy stocks faced pressure from macroeconomic currents. The consumer price index ticked up by 3%, a deceptively benign figure shadowed by inflationary fears. While high inflation often inflates gas prices, it also diverts attention to safer investments like bonds, threatening the allure of blue-chip oil stocks.\n\nNonetheless, this market tremor isn\u2019t an omen of doom. The appetite for oil remains insatiable, rooted deeply in our daily lives. Historically, oil stocks rally after corrections, their resilience unmatched. This ephemeral downturn shouldn\u2019t deter the seasoned investor, but rather remind us of the intricate dance between global events and market movements. Peace, faintly glimpsed, could reshape not just economies but lives, steering the world toward a less turbulent future.\n\nMarket Shock: The Oil Dip Everyone\u2019s Talking About!\n\nOverview\n\nThe global economy continues to weave its complex narrative, with demand for fossil fuels remaining high despite inflation and geopolitical tensions. However, a recent shift took the markets by surprise. Major energy companies such as ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, and Equinor ASA saw substantial declines in their stock values, signaling volatility within the energy sector. This shift was catalyzed by a surprising geopolitical development that hints at a potential easing of global tensions.\n\nGeopolitical Developments and Market Response\n\nRecent developments suggest a possible peace arrangement that could change the dynamics of energy markets. The Brent oil futures fell by over 2% following an unexpected announcement from former President Trump, who has offered to mediate between President Putin of Russia and President Zelensky of Ukraine. This initiative marks a critical step towards pausing conflict in Ukraine, potentially stabilizing essential Black Sea oil routes, and pacifying nervous global markets.\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\n\u2013 How could peace in the Ukraine affect global energy markets?\n\n\u2013 Peace could stabilize oil supply routes, particularly through the Black Sea, likely easing global oil prices.\n\n\u2013 What role does geopolitical stability play in energy prices?\n\n\u2013 A more stable geopolitical climate generally leads to more predictable energy supplies and pricing, reducing market volatility.\n\nMacroeconomic Influences\n\nAnother factor influencing the market is the consumer price index, which rose by 3%. Although this inflates gas prices, high inflation prompts investors to seek refuge in safer investments like bonds, threatening the appeal of oil stocks. Despite these challenges, the long-term demand for oil remains robust. Historically, oil stocks have rebounded robustly following corrections in the market.\n\nAdditional Context:\n\n\u2013 According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is expected to remain strong, driven by Asia\u2019s economic recovery and continued consumption growth in developing markets.\n\n\u2013 Sustainable energy transition efforts are intensifying, but experts agree that oil will continue to play a crucial role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future.\n\nScience and Technology Impacts\n\nThe ongoing transition to renewable energy highlights the importance of diversifying energy sources to ensure stability. Advances in technology are pivotal in shaping sustainable energy production, which may affect fossil fuel demand in the long term.\n\n\u2013 Innovations in battery technology, for instance, are crucial for increasing the viability of solar and wind energy.\n\n\u2013 Countries investing in carbon capture and hydrogen energy illustrate a strategic shift that could eventually diminish fossil fuel reliance.\n\nRelated Technology Links:\n\n\u2013 International Energy Agency\n\nImportant Query:\n\n\u2013 What technological advancements might influence the future of the energy market?\n\n\u2013 Improvements in energy storage, carbon capture technology, and hydrogen fuel development could significantly alter energy consumption patterns.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe recent market disturbances highlight how intertwined global events and economic factors are. While the current downturn in energy stocks is notable, savvy investors recognize the enduring demand and potential rebound of oil equities. Meanwhile, signs of peace offer hope for global stability and economic recovery. By balancing traditional energy reliance with emerging technologies, the world can inch closer to a more harmonious and sustainable future.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

            "content": "ConocoPhillips management said Thursday the company is making progress toward selling $2 billion of assets, including noncore properties in the Lower 48.\n\nExpand\n\nThe company acquired Marathon Oil Corp. in November and has been working to cut costs since then. Andy O\u2019Brien, senior vice president of strategy, said ConocoPhillips already has agreements in place to sell some Permian Basin assets for $600 million, a deal set to be completed in the first half of this year.\n\nThe company is also continuing to explore the sale of part of its 30% equity stake in the first 1.8 Bcf/d phase of Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s Port Arthur LNG project under construction southeast of Houston.\n\nO\u2019Brien said the company has entertained inquiries about its stake in the project, but he added \u201cwe can be patient. We don\u2019t need to rush anything here. The project is using project financing to fund construction now.\u201d\n\nHe told financial analysts during a call to discuss the company\u2019s year-end results that \u201cwe\u2019re very keen to see\u201d the second 1.8 Bcf/d phase of the project be completed. Saudi Arabian Oil Co., aka Aramco, is working to finalize an agreement to take a 25% equity stake in the second phase, which has not started construction.\n\n\u201cThere's going to be cost sharing across the common facilities of the two projects,\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cSo it's only in our interest to see Phase 2 go. But I think it's fair to say our primary focus is on building out our offtake and regas capacity\u201d to 10-15 million tons/year (Mt/y).\n\n\u201cSo maybe that sort of gives you the background on our thinking on Port Arthur Phase 2.\u201d\n\nThe Houston-based company has so far secured more than 7 Mt/y of LNG offtake across the world as building a global export portfolio has been one of its primary focuses in recent years. It has also signed deals to take 4.5 Mt/y of European regasification capacity.\n\nCEO Ryan Lance described the LNG portfolio as a hedge against lower prices in North America. NGI\u2019s Daily Historical Data shows that the daily spot Henry Hub price averaged just $2.19/MMBtu in 2024, down from $2.53 the year before.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a great way to take advantage of those molecules and move them to higher valued markets through that LNG channel, which we\u2019ve described to everybody,\u201d Lance said of the global natural gas operations.\n\nThe company plans to spend $12.9 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from a high end of $11.5 billion guided last year. A big chunk of the spending will be in Alaska, where it is developing the 180,000 b/d Willow oil project on the North Slope.\n\nAs part of a series of executive orders to expand American energy, President Trump signed one last month making it easier to develop Alaska\u2019s natural resources.\n\n\u201cFundamentally we believe that continued exploration west of Willow is the right thing to do for energy,\u201d said Kirk Johnson, senior vice president of global operations. \u201cIt's the right thing to do for the state of Alaska and its stakeholders. And clearly we're in a really good position. We're putting ourselves in a position to continue exploring west of Willow.\u201d\n\nConocoPhillips produced 2.2 million boe/d in the fourth quarter, up by 281,000 boe/d in the year-ago period. Lower 48 production included 833,000 boe/d in the Permian, 296,000 boe/d in the Eagle Ford Shale and 151,000 boe/d in the Bakken Shale.\n\nThe company reported fourth quarter net income of $2.3 billion ($1.90/share), compared with year-ago net income of $3 billion ($2.52). Earnings declined on acquisition-related costs and lower commodity prices, among other things.\n\nConocoPhillips average realized price for the fourth quarter was $52.37/boe, down from $58.21 in 4Q2023.\n\nFull-year net income was $9.2 billion ($7.81), compared with profits of $11 billion ($9.06) in 2023.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other natural gas and oil dividend stocks.\n\nThe United States of America is the Largest Oil Producing Country in the World. The country\u2019s oil production has surged by almost 50% over the last decade, reaching just over 13.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in October 2024. However, despite the historically high levels of output, total US production growth has slowed in recent years, climbing only about 280,000 bpd last year. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted the country\u2019s crude oil production to flatten in 2026, with operators reducing the number of active drilling rigs as crude oil prices fall, allowing natural declines in existing wells to overtake production from new wells next year. The EIA expects US crude production to reach an all-time high in 2025, averaging 13.5 million bpd, increasing slightly to 13.6 million bpd in 2026.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nThe US natural gas output also stands near an all-time high as a period of strong demand and improved prices sparked a resurgence in production. The EIA expects these prices to further increase in 2025 and 2026 as demand for natural gas is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The country\u2019s natural gas sector is also set to benefit greatly from the ongoing AI boom, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made repeated calls to the American oil and gas sector to increase production as he holds the fossil fuel industry as a centerpiece of his broader economic mission. However, the country\u2019s O&G majors are reluctant as increasing output even further could create a glut and drive prices down, which they want to avoid.\n\nInstead, producers are focused on keeping their capital spending under control and attaining higher operational efficiencies, while prioritizing returning cash to shareholders after a pricing rout in the last decade hurt profits and share prices. Several oil bigwigs have even had to resort to borrowing money to make sure they keep their shareholders happy. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago. However, maintaining such high payouts to shareholders will get even tougher for the oil majors in the future, as the EIA expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, rising by over 6% in November before falling almost 10% in December. The broader energy sector ended 2024 with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we observed various companies working in the oil and gas sector and then picked out companies with the highest dividend yields as of February 6, 2025, and ranked them by their number of hedge fund investors according to the Insider Monkey database as of Q3 2024. Following are the Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 66\n\nDividend Yield: 3.12%\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the world\u2019s largest independent E&P companies based on oil and natural gas production and proved reserves. The company also has a long history in the LNG sector and is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of US LNG exports.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) had a strong Q4 2024, substantially raising its production by 14.8% YoY to 2,183 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. This surge was especially boosted by the $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon in late November, which added high-quality, low-cost supply inventory to its portfolio. The company reported a revenue of $14.7 billion, down 3.72% YoY but still beating analysts\u2019 estimates by over $514 million. Q4 EPS was reported at $1.98, beating Wall Street estimates as higher production helped offset lower crude prices. To strengthen its balance sheet following the mega acquisition of Marathon, ConocoPhillips announced that it is making solid progress on its planned $2 billion of asset sales, and has agreements in place to sell non-core lower 40 assets for approximately $600 million before customer adjustments in the first half of 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) generated $20.3 billion in cash from operations in 2024 and returned $9.1 billion to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. The company has also declared its ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share for Q1 of 2025 and announced that it plans to return $10 billion to its shareholders this year.\n\nOverall COP ranks 2nd on our list of the best natural gas and oil dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for COP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that ConocoPhillips ( ) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase ConocoPhillips' shares on or after the 14th of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 3rd of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.78 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.72 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that ConocoPhillips has a trailing yield of 3.8% on the current share price of US$98.36. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether ConocoPhillips's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. ConocoPhillips paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 46% of its free cash flow in the past year.\n\nIt's positive to see that ConocoPhillips's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at ConocoPhillips, with earnings per share up 2.4% on average over the last five years. Recent growth has not been impressive. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, ConocoPhillips has lifted its dividend by approximately 3.0% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs ConocoPhillips worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and ConocoPhillips is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but ConocoPhillips is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. ConocoPhillips looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.\n\nIn light of that, while ConocoPhillips has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Our analysis shows and you should be aware of it before buying any shares.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against other best energy dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe energy sector\u2019s presence within the broader US stock market has fluctuated over time. In the 1970s, it accounted for around 15% of the market, whereas today, it represents just 3.2% of the broader index, as reported by U.S. Bancorp Investments. However, energy consumption has increased since the 1970s, and its significance has not diminished. According to analysts, from an economic standpoint, energy stocks hold a more substantial role in the broader market than their current index weighting suggests.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nTowards the end of 2024, energy sector stocks saw considerable fluctuations, rising by over 6% in November before declining nearly 10% in December. By the close of the year, the broader market\u2019s energy sector, which had been up nearly 20% at its highest point, finished 2024 with a return of just 5.72%. This performance fell well behind the wider market. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management, made the following comment about the performance of energy stocks:\n\n\u201cAs 2024 came to a close, markets responded to the environment for energy prices. In part, it reflects concern that Oil Petroleum Exporting Countries+ (OPEC+) may soon boost production, which would add to an already solid supply situation. The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn\u2019t well demanded. Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Europe are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global oil demand is lagging.\u201d\n\nAlthough energy stocks fell short of investor expectations, global investment in the low-carbon energy transition grew by 11% in 2024, reaching a record $2.1 trillion, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s (BNEF) Energy Transition Investment Trends 2025 report. This growth was largely driven by increased investment in electrified transportation, renewable energy, power grids, and energy storage, all of which hit new highs last year. However, while total investment in energy transition technologies set a new record, its growth rate was slower than in the previous three years, when annual increases ranged from 24% to 29%.\n\nBNEF\u2019s report also highlighted a clear divide between investment in well-established and emerging clean energy sectors. Proven technologies with scalable business models\u2014such as renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles, and power grids\u2014accounted for the bulk of 2024\u2019s investment, totaling $1.93 trillion, a 14.7% increase. This growth persisted despite challenges from policy changes, higher interest rates, and an expected slowdown in consumer demand.\n\nEven as oil prices decline, an increasing number of fossil fuel companies are allocating a larger share of their profits to shareholders, indicating a shift in focus away from reinvesting in oilfield development. Some major oil firms have even taken on debt to maintain shareholder payouts. According to Bloomberg, four of the world\u2019s five oil supermajors borrowed a combined $15 billion between July and September 2024 to fund share buybacks, underscoring their commitment to rewarding investors. In addition, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago, as reported by Janus Henderson.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting energy companies across various sectors within the energy industry, including exploration and production, utilities, renewable energy, and oil refining and marketing. From this pool of companies, we identified 10 companies that prioritize distributing dividends to their shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "The yearly results for ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$56b and statutory earnings per share of US$7.81. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on ConocoPhillips after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ConocoPhillips\n\nNYSE:COP Earnings and Revenue Growth February 8th 2025\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from ConocoPhillips' 15 analysts is for revenues of US$61.3b in 2025. This reflects a meaningful 8.6% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to climb 18% to US$8.56. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$60.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.41 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$132. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on ConocoPhillips, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$165 and the most bearish at US$114 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that ConocoPhillips' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 8.6% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 19% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 3.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while ConocoPhillips' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips ( ) came out with its annual results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$56b and statutory earnings per share of US$7.81 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that ConocoPhillips is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for ConocoPhillips from 15 analysts is for revenues of US$61.3b in 2025. If met, it would imply a meaningful 8.6% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 18% to US$8.56. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$60.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.41 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$132, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values ConocoPhillips at US$165 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$114. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the . We would highlight that ConocoPhillips' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.6% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 19% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while ConocoPhillips' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$132, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on ConocoPhillips. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

            "content": "Q : Ryan, you outlined a 10% increase in cash return to $10 billion. What drove your decision for this cash return in 2025, and how might it flex with commodity price changes? A : Ryan Lance, CEO: Our strategy since 2016 has been to return significant cash to shareholders. Despite recent WTI downdrafts, we felt comfortable with the $10 billion target. We have flexibility with a strong balance sheet and asset sales, and we typically share upside from commodity price increases with shareholders.\n\nConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) faces potential challenges from tariffs and regulatory changes, which could impact their operations and financial performance.\n\nConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) expects 2025 to be the peak year for long-cycle project spending at around $3 billion.\n\nThe company faced a $1 billion operating working capital headwind in the fourth quarter, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and payable.\n\nConocoPhillips ( NYSE:COP ) announced a target to return $10 billion to shareholders in 2025, consisting of $4 billion in dividends and $6 billion in buybacks.\n\nThe company returned $9.1 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 45% of their cash flow from operations.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the outlook for long-cycle CapEx, particularly in Alaska, Qatar, and Port Arthur Phase 2? A: Andy O'Brien, SVP: Port Arthur Phase 2 is progressing, but our focus is on building out offtake and re-gas capacity. For long-cycle projects, 2025 is the peak year of spending at $3 billion, with a steady stream of project start-ups expected from 2026 to 2029, leading to significant cash flow improvements.\n\nQ: With the extraordinary performance in the Lower 48, do you plan to accept this production growth or adjust activity levels? A: Ryan Lance, CEO: Production growth is an outcome of our plans. We focus on efficiency and capital returns, not just growth. The Marathon acquisition allows us to optimize plateaus in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, maintaining efficient operations without whipsawing the organization.\n\nQ: Can you provide more color on the $1.4 billion reduction in Lower 48 CapEx and its impact on production growth? A: Nick Olds, EVP: The reduction is driven by operational improvements, synergy capture, and modest deflation. We expect to maintain low single-digit growth with flat activity levels, leveraging efficiencies and synergies from the Marathon assets.\n\nQ: What is the status of the Willow project in Alaska, and how does the policy environment affect your plans? A: Kirk Johnson, SVP: Willow is progressing well, with peak construction this winter. The recent executive order reversing NPRA restrictions doesn't affect our current activities but supports future exploration west of Willow. We remain focused on delivering the project on time and budget.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

It expects to complete the sales in the first half of 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips ended 2024 with $6.11 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Current assets totaled $15.65 billion.\n\nIt owed $1.04 billion in short-term debt, while current liabilities totaled $12.12 billion.\n\nMeanwhile its year-end proven reserves were at 7.8 billion boe with a preliminary reserve replacement ratio of 244 percent. \u201cExcluding closed acquisitions and dispositions, the preliminary organic reserve replacement ratio was 123 percent\u201d, it said.\n\nIn 2025 ConocoPhillips expects to produce 2.34 MMboed to 2.38 MMboed.\n\nIt plans to distribute $10 billion to shareholders this year, compared to $9.1 billion in 2024. That will include a first-quarter ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

            "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: ConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is primarily involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Considering proved reserves and production, the company is among the largest explorers and producers in the world. The company, founded in 1875, has a strong presence across conventional and unconventional plays in 13 countries. ConocoPhillips\u2019 low-risk and cost-effective operations are spread across North America, Asia, Australia and Europe.\n\nCOP is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 12.04; value investors should take notice.\n\nSix analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $8.30 per share. COP boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.1%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, COP should be on investors' short list.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Special items for the current quarter were primarily due to transaction and integration expenses largely offset by a tax benefit, both resulting from the acquisition of Marathon Oil, and debt transaction-related expenses.\n\nFull-year 2024 earnings were $9.2 billion, or $7.81 per share, compared with full-year 2023 earnings of $11.0 billion, or $9.06 per share.

global and regional changes in the demand, supply, prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas, including changes as a result of any ongoing military conflict and the global response to such conflict, security threats on facilities and infrastructure, global health crises, the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries or the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes; the potential for insufficient liquidity or other factors, such as those described herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends, whether fixed or variable; potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance; reductions in our reserve replacement rates, whether as a result of significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise; unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage; failure to progress or complete announced and future development plans related to constructing, modifying or operating related to constructing, modifying or operating E&P and LNG facilities, or unexpected changes in costs, inflationary pressures or technical equipment related to such plans; significant operational or investment changes imposed by legislative and regulatory initiatives and international agreements addressing environmental concerns, including initiatives addressing the impact of global climate change, such as limiting or reducing GHG emissions, regulations concerning hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring or water disposal and prohibitions on commodity exports; broader societal attention to and efforts to address climate change may cause substantial investment in and increased adoption of competing or alternative energy sources; risks, uncertainties and high costs that may prevent us from successfully executing on our Climate Risk Strategy; lack or inadequacy of, or disruptions in reliable transportation for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs; inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for construction, drilling and/or development, or inability to make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with any necessary permits or applicable laws or regulations;

competition and consolidation in the oil and gas E&P industry, including competition for sources of supply, services, personnel and equipment; any limitations on our access to capital or increase in our cost of capital or insurance, including as a result of illiquidity, changes or uncertainty in domestic or international financial markets, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or investment sentiment; challenges or delays to our execution of, or successful implementation of the acquisition of Marathon Oil or any future asset dispositions or acquisitions we elect to pursue; potential disruption of our operations, including the diversion of management time and attention; our inability to realize anticipated cost savings or capital expenditure reductions; difficulties integrating acquired businesses and technologies; or other unanticipated changes; our inability to deploy the net proceeds from any asset dispositions that are pending or that we elect to undertake in the future in the manner and timeframe we anticipate, if at all; the operation, financing and management of risks of our joint ventures; the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us, including our ability to collect payments when due from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA; uncertainty as to the long-term value of our common stock; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors \u2013 The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. We may use the term \u201cresource\u201d in this news release that the SEC\u2019s guidelines prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC and from the ConocoPhillips website.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information \u2013 To supplement the presentation of the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information contain certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted earnings (calculated on a consolidated and on a segment-level basis), adjusted earnings per share (EPS), cash from operations (CFO), adjusted operating costs, adjusted corporate segment net loss, return on capital employed (ROCE) and cash adjusted ROCE.\n\nThe company believes that the non-GAAP measure adjusted earnings (both on an aggregate and a per-share basis), adjusted operating costs and adjusted corporate segment net loss are useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the company\u2019s operating performance associated with the company\u2019s core business operations across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance and cost structures of peer companies by excluding items that do not directly relate to the company\u2019s core business operations. Adjusted earnings is defined as earnings removing the impact of special items. Adjusted EPS is a measure of the company\u2019s diluted net earnings per share excluding special items. Adjusted operating costs is defined as the sum of production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, adjusted to exclude expenses that do not directly relate to the company\u2019s core business operations and are included as adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings to the extent those adjustments impact operating costs. Adjusted corporate segment net loss is defined as corporate and other segment earnings adjusted for special items. The company further believes that the non-GAAP measure CFO is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the timing effects associated with operating working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies. ROCE is a measure of the profitability of the company\u2019s capital employed in its business operations. The company calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. The net income is adjusted for after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to allow for comparability in the long-term view across periods. The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it relates to capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company\u2019s primary peer group. The basis of cash adjusted ROCE utilizes ROCE as defined above and further adjusts for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments as well as the after-tax interest income generated by these capital sources, as the company may retain these sources for other strategic purposes and not fully employ such capital for use in operations. As such, cash adjusted ROCE is useful for comparability across periods that may be cyclically impacted by significant cash-related transactions. The company believes that the above-mentioned non-GAAP measures, when viewed in combination with the company\u2019s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company\u2019s business and performance. The company\u2019s Board of Directors and management also use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the company\u2019s operating performance across periods when overseeing and managing the company\u2019s business.\n\nEach of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the company\u2019s results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the company\u2019s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in our industry. The company may also change the calculation of any of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information from time to time in light of its then existing operations to include other adjustments that may impact its operations.\n\nReconciliations of each non-GAAP measure presented in this news release to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the release.\n\nOther Terms \u2013 This news release also contains the term proforma underlying production. Proforma underlying production reflects the impact of closed acquisitions and closed dispositions as of Dec. 31, 2024. The impact of closed acquisitions and dispositions assumes a closing date of Jan. 1, 2023. The company believes that underlying production is useful to investors to compare production reflecting the impact of closed acquisitions and dispositions on a consistent go-forward basis across periods and with peer companies. Return of capital is defined as the total of dividends and share repurchases. Reserve replacement is defined by the company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by current year production. Organic reserve replacement is defined by the company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production and excluding acquisitions and dispositions, divided by current year production. The company believes that reserve replacement and organic reserve replacement are useful to investors to help understand how changes in proved reserves, net of production compare with the company\u2019s current year production, inclusive and exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions, respectively.\n\nReferences in the release to earnings refer to net income.\n\nConocoPhillips Table 1: Reconciliation of earnings to adjusted earnings $ millions, except as indicated 4Q24 4Q23 2024 FY 2023 FY Pre-tax Income tax After- Tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Earnings $ 2,306 $ 1.90 3,007 2.52 9,245 7.81 10,957 9.06 Adjustments: (Gain) loss on asset sales\u00b9 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (86 ) 20 (66 ) (0.06 ) (94 ) (6 ) (100 ) (0.08 ) Tax adjustments \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (203 ) (203 ) (0.17 ) \u2014 (76 ) (76 ) (0.06 ) \u2014 (347 ) (347 ) (0.30 ) Deferred tax adjustments \u2014 (28 ) (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (28 ) (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Tax adjustment - acquisition related \u2014 (423 ) (423 ) (0.36 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (423 ) (423 ) (0.36 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Transaction and integration expenses\u00b2 514 (70 ) 444 0.37 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 542 (76 ) 466 0.39 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (Gain) loss on FX derivative \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 73 (15 ) 58 0.05 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 132 (27 ) 105 0.09 (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment 173 (26 ) 147 0.12 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 173 (26 ) 147 0.12 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (Gain) loss in interest rate hedge\u00b3 (35 ) 7 (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (35 ) 7 (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Pending claims and settlements (16 ) (33 ) (49 ) (0.04 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (16 ) (33 ) (49 ) (0.04 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Impairments 47 (11 ) 36 0.03 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 47 (11 ) 36 0.03 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Adjusted earnings / (loss) $ 2,405 $ 1.98 2,862 2.40 9,224 7.79 10,615 8.77 \u00b9Includes 3Q23 divestiture of Lower 48 equity investment. \u00b2Includes $20MM pre-tax of other expenses in addition to the adjustments to operating costs shown in Table 5. \u00b3Interest rate hedging (gain) loss from PALNG Phase 1 investment.

the potential for insufficient liquidity or other factors, such as those described herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends, whether fixed or variable; potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance; reductions in our reserve replacement rates, whether as a result of significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise; unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage; failure to progress or complete announced and future development plans related to constructing, modifying or operating related to constructing, modifying or operating E&P and LNG facilities, or unexpected changes in costs, inflationary pressures or technical equipment related to such plans;

Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors \u2013 The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. We may use the term \u201cresource\u201d in this news release that the SEC\u2019s guidelines prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC and from the ConocoPhillips website.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information \u2013 To supplement the presentation of the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information contain certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted earnings (calculated on a consolidated and on a segment-level basis), adjusted earnings per share (EPS), cash from operations (CFO), adjusted operating costs, adjusted corporate segment net loss, return on capital employed (ROCE) and cash adjusted ROCE.\n\nThe company believes that the non-GAAP measure adjusted earnings (both on an aggregate and a per-share basis), adjusted operating costs and adjusted corporate segment net loss are useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the company\u2019s operating performance associated with the company\u2019s core business operations across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance and cost structures of peer companies by excluding items that do not directly relate to the company\u2019s core business operations. Adjusted earnings is defined as earnings removing the impact of special items. Adjusted EPS is a measure of the company\u2019s diluted net earnings per share excluding special items. Adjusted operating costs is defined as the sum of production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, adjusted to exclude expenses that do not directly relate to the company\u2019s core business operations and are included as adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings to the extent those adjustments impact operating costs. Adjusted corporate segment net loss is defined as corporate and other segment earnings adjusted for special items. The company further believes that the non-GAAP measure CFO is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the timing effects associated with operating working capital changes across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies. ROCE is a measure of the profitability of the company\u2019s capital employed in its business operations. The company calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. The net income is adjusted for after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to allow for comparability in the long-term view across periods. The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it relates to capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company\u2019s primary peer group. The basis of cash adjusted ROCE utilizes ROCE as defined above and further adjusts for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments as well as the after-tax interest income generated by these capital sources, as the company may retain these sources for other strategic purposes and not fully employ such capital for use in operations. As such, cash adjusted ROCE is useful for comparability across periods that may be cyclically impacted by significant cash-related transactions. The company believes that the above-mentioned non-GAAP measures, when viewed in combination with the company\u2019s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company\u2019s business and performance. The company\u2019s Board of Directors and management also use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the company\u2019s operating performance across periods when overseeing and managing the company\u2019s business.\n\nEach of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the company\u2019s results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the company\u2019s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in our industry. The company may also change the calculation of any of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information from time to time in light of its then existing operations to include other adjustments that may impact its operations.\n\nReconciliations of each non-GAAP measure presented in this news release to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the release.\n\nOther Terms \u2013 This news release also contains the term proforma underlying production. Proforma underlying production reflects the impact of closed acquisitions and closed dispositions as of Dec. 31, 2024. The impact of closed acquisitions and dispositions assumes a closing date of Jan. 1, 2023. The company believes that underlying production is useful to investors to compare production reflecting the impact of closed acquisitions and dispositions on a consistent go-forward basis across periods and with peer companies. Return of capital is defined as the total of dividends and share repurchases. Reserve replacement is defined by the company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by current year production. Organic reserve replacement is defined by the company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production and excluding acquisitions and dispositions, divided by current year production. The company believes that reserve replacement and organic reserve replacement are useful to investors to help understand how changes in proved reserves, net of production compare with the company\u2019s current year production, inclusive and exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions, respectively.\n\nReferences in the release to earnings refer to net income.\n\nConocoPhillips Table 1: Reconciliation of earnings to adjusted earnings $ millions, except as indicated 4Q24 4Q23 2024 FY 2023 FY Pre-tax Income tax After- Tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Pre-tax Income tax After- tax Per share\n\nof common\n\nstock\n\n(dollars) Earnings $ 2,306 $ 1.90 3,007 2.52 9,245 7.81 10,957 9.06 Adjustments: (Gain) loss on asset sales\u00b9 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (86 ) 20 (66 ) (0.06 ) (94 ) (6 ) (100 ) (0.08 ) Tax adjustments \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (203 ) (203 ) (0.17 ) \u2014 (76 ) (76 ) (0.06 ) \u2014 (347 ) (347 ) (0.30 ) Deferred tax adjustments \u2014 (28 ) (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (28 ) (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Tax adjustment - acquisition related \u2014 (423 ) (423 ) (0.36 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (423 ) (423 ) (0.36 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Transaction and integration expenses\u00b2 514 (70 ) 444 0.37 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 542 (76 ) 466 0.39 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (Gain) loss on FX derivative \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 73 (15 ) 58 0.05 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 132 (27 ) 105 0.09 (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment 173 (26 ) 147 0.12 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 173 (26 ) 147 0.12 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (Gain) loss in interest rate hedge\u00b3 (35 ) 7 (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (35 ) 7 (28 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Pending claims and settlements (16 ) (33 ) (49 ) (0.04 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (16 ) (33 ) (49 ) (0.04 ) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Impairments 47 (11 ) 36 0.03 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 47 (11 ) 36 0.03 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Adjusted earnings / (loss) $ 2,405 $ 1.98 2,862 2.40 9,224 7.79 10,615 8.77 \u00b9Includes 3Q23 divestiture of Lower 48 equity investment. \u00b2Includes $20M M pre-tax of other expenses in addition to the adjustments to operating costs shown in Table 5. \u00b3Interest rate hedging (gain) loss from PALNG Phase 1 investment.

            "content": "Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips (COP) is one of the world's largest independent exploration and production (E&P) companies, commanding a market cap of $113.3 billion. The company is focused on the responsible extraction, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Unlike integrated oil companies, ConocoPhillips operates exclusively in the upstream segment of the energy industry.\n\nCOP shares have substantially underperformed the broader market over the past year, falling 9.1% over the past 52 weeks and rising 1.4% in 2025. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has soared 21.8% over the past year and a 2.7% rise in 2025.\n\nNarrowing the focus, ConocoPhillips also underperformed the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF\u2019s (XOP) 4.9% gains over the past 52 weeks and is up 3.6% on a YTD basis.\n\nWhile ConocoPhillips has suffered over the past year, it has set itself up for a strong 2025 thanks to its strategic acquisition of Marathon Oil in late November.\n\nCOP shares jumped 6.4% after releasing its Q3 earnings release on Oct. 31. It posted revenue of $13.6 billion, down from $14.9 billion a year earlier, with earnings dropping to $2.1 billion ($1.76 per share) from $2.8 billion ($2.32 per share). The decline was driven by a 10% year-over-year decrease in average realized prices, primarily due to sharply lower natural gas prices in the lower 48 states, which account for nearly half of the company\u2019s production. Going forward, ConocoPhillips raised production guidance for Q4 to 1.99 million to 2.03 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nFor FY2024, which ended in December 2024, analysts expect COP to report a 12.9% year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS to $7.64. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is mixed. It surpassed Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters while missing on two other occasions.\n\nCOP stock has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Among the 28 analysts covering the stock, 23 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two advise \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and three suggest a \u201cHold\u201d rating.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than a month ago, with 22 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nOn Jan. 23, Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF) analyst John Freeman raised ConocoPhillips' price target to $157 from $148 while maintaining a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating. Freeman noted that while the fourth quarter was underwhelming in terms of stock performance, it has positioned the Exploration and Production sector favorably for the new year.\n\nThe mean price target of $132.69 suggests a potential upside of 31.9%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $165 represents a premium of 64% to current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies ConocoPhillips' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company\n\n\n\nA look at the shareholders of ConocoPhillips ( ) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ConocoPhillips.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ConocoPhillips?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nConocoPhillips already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of ConocoPhillips, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ConocoPhillips. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.2% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of ConocoPhillips\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that ConocoPhillips insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$94m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

            "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that ConocoPhillips (COP) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.89 per share in its forthcoming report, representing a decline of 21.3% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $14.47 billion, declining 5.4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 15% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific ConocoPhillips metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenues- Sales and other operating revenues' should arrive at $13.94 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenues- Equity in earnings of affiliates' at $403.06 million. The estimate points to a change of -4.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Sales and Other Operating Revenue- Natural gas liquids' should come in at $690.11 million. The estimate suggests a change of +5.4% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Gain (loss) on dispositions' will reach $24.00 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -14.3%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Sales and Other Operating Revenues- Canada' to reach $913.94 million. The estimate points to a change of +0.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Sales and Other Operating Revenues- Asia Pacific' will reach $461.41 million. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Sales and Other Operating Revenues- Europe, Middle East and North Africa' will likely reach $1.42 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -9.6% from the prior-year quarter.",

In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips COP is set to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 6, before the opening bell.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.89 per share, implying a decline of 21.3% from the year-ago reported number. Three analysts revised the estimate downward in the past 30 days against three upward movements. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $14.5 billion, suggesting a decline of 5.4% from the year-ago actuals.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCOP beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, with the average surprise being 4.87%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nQ4 Earnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t predict an earnings beat for COP this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.\n\nThe leading upstream energy player has an Earnings ESP of -1.77%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.85 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. COP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nFactors Shaping Q4 Results\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average spot prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at Cushing, OK, were $71.99 per barrel in October, $69.95 per barrel in November and $70.12 per barrel in December. The favorable crude pricing environment in the fourth quarter is likely to have benefited ConocoPhillips' exploration and production activities, potentially boosting the company\u2019s production volumes.\n\nOur model forecasts a 5% year-over-year increase in the company\u2019s total daily oil equivalent production volumes. In the prolific Lower 48 region, which significantly contributes to COP\u2019s production, daily oil equivalent volumes are expected to have risen 2.5% year over year, according to our model. Notably, Lower 48 represents the company\u2019s high-quality unconventional resources in the United States.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nCOP's stock has declined 7.3% over the past year against a 3.8% gain of the industry\u2019s composite stocks.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith the price decline, it appears relatively undervalued. The company's current trailing 12-month enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 5.02, which is trading at a discount compared to the industry average of 12.05.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCOP\u2019s Investment Thesis\n\nLate last year, ConocoPhillips completed the Marathon Oil acquisition. The integration has broadened ConocoPhillips' key Lower 48 portfolio while enabling it to expand its presence in prolific, low-cost U.S. basins such as Eagle Ford, Bakken, Delaware and Permian, adding more than 2 billion barrels of resources.\n\nThe leading upstream energy company has consistently prioritized acquisitions that support its long-term objective of enhancing stockholder value. With the completion of the deal, ConocoPhillips anticipates achieving annual savings exceeding $1 billion by integrating operations and expects the savings to be fully realized within the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, its exclusive focus on exploration and production makes it vulnerable to oil price volatility, posing greater challenges during downturns compared to diversified majors like Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM and Chevron Corporation CVX.\n\nAlso, the future of the Willow Project remains uncertain, casting a shadow over COP\u2019s long-term growth. While Trump\u2019s pro-oil stance could pave the way for expansion, environmental concerns and Biden-era restrictions continue to pose significant hurdles. If full approval is denied, COP may lose access to a vast oil and gas reserve, limiting its ability to scale production. This uncertainty underscores the company\u2019s reliance on regulatory shifts, shaping its growth trajectory.\n\nLast Word\n\nWhile COP offers promising long-term potential and appealing valuations, investors should remain patient and monitor the resolution of ongoing uncertainties. Those already holding the stock are advised to maintain their position.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "In response to the United States\u2019 unilateral decision to impose a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, China has announced its intention to retaliate by imposing tariffs on certain US imports.\n\nWhat Happened: The State Council Customs Tariff Commission announced on Tuesday that it will be imposing tariffs on certain US imports, effective from Feb. 10. The decision comes in response to the U.S. government\u2019s decision to levy a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the tariffs will be as follows:\n\n1. A 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\n2. A 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, high-displacement vehicles, and pickup trucks.\n\n3. Additional tariffs will be imposed on the listed U.S. imports, on top of the existing rates. The current tax exemption and reduction policies will remain unchanged, and the additional tariffs will not be subject to reduction.\n\nSEE ALSO: Nvidia, TSMC Stocks Fell As Trump Hit Mexico, Canada, And China With Tariffs\u2014But Top Analyst Sees Only \u2018Limited\u2019 Supply Chain Impact On Chips\n\nThe announcement was made according to the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the Customs Law, the Foreign Trade Law, and international legal principles. The decision was approved by the State Council.\n\nIn a separate statement, officials from the Chinese Commerce Ministry and customs announced the implementation of export controls on items related to tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, and molybdenum.\n\nWhy It Matters: The decision by China to impose tariffs on select US imports comes in response to the US government\u2019s decision to levy a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. This move is part of the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic powerhouses, which have been escalating in recent years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2018s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China are predicted to impact several sectors and potentially lead to retailers and companies raising prices on consumers to offset the higher prices.\n\nRenowned economist and Obama-era Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, criticized President Trump's recent tariff impositions, describing them as a \"bully strategy\" that could have far-reaching negative impacts.\n\nAmong crude oil and LNG exporters, companies like Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX, and ConocoPhillips COP, which have significant exports to China, could see higher costs due to the new tariffs. Similarly, U.S. automakers such as General Motors GM and Ford F, which sell vehicles in China, may encounter new challenges.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock",

            "content": "Looking for broad exposure to the Energy - Broad segment of the equity market? You should consider the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/23/2004.\n\nPassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.\n\nSector ETFs are also funds of convenience, offering many ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Energy - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 5, placing it in top 31%.\n\nIndex Details\n\nThe fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $7.70 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Energy - Broad segment of the equity market. VDE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Energy 25/50 Index before fees and expenses.\n\nThe MSCI US Investable Market Index (IMI)/Energy 25/50 is made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the energy sector.\n\nCosts\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.10%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.16%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation in the Energy sector--about 100% of the portfolio.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) accounts for about 21.65% of total assets, followed by Chevron Corp (CVX) and Conocophillips (COP).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 49.04% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nSo far this year, VDE has gained about 2.29%, and is up roughly 10.33% in the last one year (as of 02/04/2025). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $115.60 and $136.78.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 1.23 and standard deviation of 26.24% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 114 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nVanguard Energy ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VDE is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Energy ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.\n\nIShares Global Energy ETF (IXC) tracks S&P Global 1200 Energy Sector Index and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) tracks Energy Select Sector Index. IShares Global Energy ETF has $1.90 billion in assets, Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF has $32.80 billion. IXC has an expense ratio of 0.41% and XLE charges 0.09%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\nZacks Investment Research",

Brent crude followed a similar pattern, rising as traders recalibrated expectations for global supply.\n\nTraders will closely watch for further developments regarding the directive and the upcoming meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump on Tuesday, which could further shape U.S. policy on Iran and energy markets.\n\nEnergy Stocks Outperform\n\nThe broader energy sector saw significant gains as oil prices rebounded. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE jumped 1.9%, leading all other sectors. Major oil companies also saw strong moves higher, with both Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM and Chevron Corp. CVX climbing 2.2%.\n\nOn Tuesday, Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target on Chevron from $182 to $183, implying an 18% upside from current levels. Analyst Neil Mehta reiterated Chevron as a \u201ctop Super Major pick for 2025,\u201d citing three key factors such as strong capital returns, major project ramp-ups and margin expansion.\n\nGoldman expects Chevron to return approximately one-third of its market cap to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share buybacks. The stock currently yields 4.6%.\n\nKey growth drivers include increased production from the Permian Basin, U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and Kazakhstan\u2019s Tengiz field.\n\nFinally, the company is expected to improve profitability through cost-cutting and operational efficiencies.\n\nGoldman projects free cash flow of $22 billion in 2025 and $28 billion in 2026, assuming Brent crude prices of $76 and $80 per barrel, respectively. This equates to an FCF yield of 9% in 2025 and 11% in 2026.\n\nGoldman Sachs adjusted its 12-month price target on Exxon from $123 to $117, holding a \u2018Neutral\u2019 rating.\n\nThe firm acknowledges Exxon's strong operational execution and premium upstream portfolio\u2014including assets in Guyana, LNG, and the Permian\u2014but cites valuation concerns relative to peers.\n\n\u201cWhile we remain constructive on XOM's strong track record of quarterly and operational execution, we remain mindful of relative valuation,\u201d the bank stated, highlighting that Exxon\u2019s 2026 FCF yield of 8% lags behind Chevron and ConocoPhillips COP, which are projected at 11%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

However, a few leaders stand out because of their size and financial strength. Here are five of the best energy stocks to consider buying in 2025:\n\nCOMPANY TICKER WHAT IT DOES Brookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEP)(NYSE:BEPC) Globally diversified renewable energy producer. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Globally diversified oil and natural gas producer. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Globally diversified and integrated energy company. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) Leading utility and renewable energy producer. Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Leading pipeline and utility company.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at some of the best energy stocks in the industry: 1. Brookfield Renewable 1. Brookfield Renewable\n\nBrookfield Renewable (BEP -1.68%)(NYSE:BEPC)is a leading global renewable energy producer. It operates hydroelectric, solar, wind, and energy transition assets. The company sells the power produced by these assets under long-term fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to electric utilities and other large power users. The contracts enable Brookfield to generate relatively steady cash flows. It pays out a large portion of that money to investors via an attractive dividend. The company retains the balance to acquire, develop, and expand its renewable energy operations. Brookfield Renewable has an enormous backlog of renewable energy development projects. Combined with other growth drivers such as acquisitions and higher power prices, Brookfield expects to increase its funds from operation (FFO) per share by more than 10% annually through 2029. Meanwhile, it has increasingly visible and secured growth through 2034. That should support a 5% to 9% annual dividend growth, making Brookfield an excellent renewable energy dividend stock. 2. ConocoPhillips 2. ConocoPhillips\n\nConocoPhillips (COP -1.6%) is a diversified oil and natural gas producer. It has operations around the world and uses several methods to produce oil and natural gas. The oil company significantly enhanced its position by acquiring Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion all-stock deal that closed in late 2024. The transaction will add 2 billion barrels of resources to its U.S. onshore portfolio with an average cost of supply below $30 a barrel. The acquisition will be accretive to its earnings, free cash flow, and return of capital, driven in part by the expectation it will capture more than $1 billion of cost and capital synergies within the first year of closing the deal. ConocoPhillips anticipates returning a significant portion of its growing free cash flow to investors in the coming years. It plans to ramp its share repurchase rate from $5 billion annually to $7 billion, putting it on track to buy back more than $20 billion in shares in the first three years following the Marathon deal. It also pays a growing quarterly dividend. ConocoPhillips boosted its payment by 34% in late 2024. It aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the future.\n\nDefinition Icon Commodities Commodities are undifferentiated products. They are distinct from branded products like cars, watches, or smartphones, which are generally identified by the company that makes them.\n\n3. Chevron 3. Chevron\n\nChevron (NYSE:CHX) is a leading global energy company. It boasts a globally integrated oil and gas business that includes exploration and production assets, refining capabilities, and a chemicals business. The company\u2019s large-scale and integrated operations help it weather the volatility in the energy sector. Chevron uses the cash flows generated from its legacy oil and gas operations to pay a growing dividend, repurchase shares, and invest in the future. Chevron increased its dividend for the 37th straight year in 2024. It also plans to buy back between $10 billion and $20 billion of its stock each year. The company expects to grow its cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027 (assuming oil averages $60 a barrel), fueled by its high-return capital program. It could significantly exceed that level if it's successful in closing its acquisition of Hess (HES -0.08%). The roughly $60 billion deal would enable Chevron to more than double its free cash flow by 2027 (if oil averages $70 a barrel) while extending its production growth outlook into the 2030s. Chevron is also investing in the lower-carbon fuels the world will require in the future. It's focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and renewable fuels. The balance makes it an ideal choice for investors seeking a way to invest in the energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives. 4. NextEra Energy 4. NextEra Energy\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE -0.26%) is one of the country's largest electric utility companies. It's also a global leader in producing power from the wind and sun through its energy resources segment, which sells clean energy to other utilities and end users around the country. These businesses generate relatively stable cash flow. It sells and distributes power backed by government-regulated rates and fixed-price PPAs with customers. The business model is very resilient because businesses and households need a steady supply of power. NextEra Energy has one of the best financial profiles in the electric utility sector. It features one of the highest credit ratings in its peer group. NextEra also has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility, allowing it to pay a stable and growing dividend. The company expects to increase its payout at a 10% annual rate through 2026, making it an excellent renewable energy dividend stock. Its strong financial profile also allows it to make significant investments in new renewable energy capacity and related infrastructure. These investments help drive the company's expectation that it will grow its adjusted earnings per share at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% per share annual target range through 2027. It boasts strong growth prospects beyond that, powered by the accelerating demand for renewable energy for things like electric vehicles and data centers. These investments should boost its earnings while reducing its emissions, producing a win-win outcome for shareholders and the planet.\n\nDefinition Icon Capital Capital is any type of asset that you can use to generate future value, including cash and tangible and intangible assets.\n\n5. Enbridge 5. Enbridge\n\nEnbridge (ENB 0.02%) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. It has four core operating segments: Liquids pipelines : It moves 30% of the oil produced in North America.\n\n: It moves 30% of the oil produced in North America. Gas transmission & midstream : Enbridge transports almost 20% of all the gas consumed in the U.S.\n\n: Enbridge transports almost 20% of all the gas consumed in the U.S. Gas distribution : It operates North America's largest natural gas utility by customer count.\n\n: It operates North America's largest natural gas utility by customer count. Renewable energy: Enbridge has a diversified renewable energy platform, including a growing European offshore wind business. Enbridge's leading energy infrastructure portfolio generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. It significantly enhanced the stability of its earnings profile in 2024 by acquiring three natural gas utilities from Dominion (D 0.69%) in a $14 billion transformational deal that meaningfully increased its gas distribution business. It now gets about half its earnings from liquids pipelines and the other 50% from lower carbon energy (e.g., gas and renewables). The company distributes 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow to investors via a very attractive dividend. It retains the rest to help finance its continued expansion. The company has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured expansion projects under construction, giving it lots of visibility into future growth. Enbridge expects its cash flow per share to increase by about 3% per year through 2026 and at a roughly 5% annual rate over the medium term. Enbridge's growing cash flow should allow it to continue increasing its dividend. The company delivered its 30th consecutive annual dividend increase at the end of 2024.\n\nInvesting in the energy sector How to invest in the energy sector The energy sector is a challenging one for investors, especially when it comes to oil and natural gas companies. Energy prices can change in a heartbeat. Volatility can have a massive impact on the sector, as well as on the global economy. Because of the impact commodity price volatility can have on the energy sector, investors need to understand how to invest in energy stocks. That includes keeping risks in mind and not allocating too much of a portfolio to one energy stock or the entire industry. Investors should focus on oil and natural gas companies with the financial and operational strength to survive if industry conditions significantly deteriorate. Factors that increase an energy company's durability include: A low-risk business model: For oil and natural gas producers, this means having diversified operations and low production costs. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure companies should have stable revenue with minimal exposure to fluctuations in volumes or pricing, such as operations supported by regulated rates or long-term fixed-fee contracts.\n\nFor oil and natural gas producers, this means having diversified operations and low production costs.

In addition, an energy company should have a conservative dividend payout ratio compared to its peers. Manageable capital spending programs primarily financed with post-dividend free cash flow and prudent use of debt. Energy companies with these characteristics will be in a better position to withstand the inevitable cyclical downturns. That means they will still be around when market conditions improve. They will also have more flexibility than their weaker peers to capture opportunities that can create value for their investors.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nShould you invest?

In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other large-cap stocks.\n\nInvestors should closely monitor insider trading activity as it can provide valuable insights into a company's future prospects. Insiders, such as executives and directors, possess intimate knowledge of the company's operations and strategic direction. When these individuals invest their own capital in company stock, it often signals strong confidence in the company's future performance.\n\nWhile not an infallible indicator, significant insider buying activity can suggest that the company may be undervalued or poised for growth. Conversely, while insider selling can have various motivations, it can sometimes signal concerns about the company's future.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that insider trading activity should be analyzed within the broader context of the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and overall market conditions. A stock seeing heavy insider buying doesn\u2019t always mean it will go up sharply in the future. Therefore, investors should carefully consider the underlying reasons for insider transactions and conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions based on this information alone. By carefully analyzing insider trading activity alongside other relevant factors, investors can gain valuable insights into a company's prospects and make more informed investment decisions.\n\nTo come up with the 10 names, we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. We first used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener and looked for stocks with at least two insiders buying over the last six months.\n\nWith each stock we note the number of recent insider purchases and the company\u2019s current market capitalization. But why is it important to follow insider activity? Our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences.

The best acreage in the mighty Permian Basin is mostly accounted for, locked up in the portfolios of some of the world\u2019s largest oil producers.\n\nThe growth engines for other key Lower 48 plays\u2014the Williston, the Eagle Ford, the Denver-Julesburg (D-J)\u2014have sputtered and transitioned into long plateaus.\n\nMore emerging plays, like Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin and the Ohio Utica oil window, are showing upside, but they are dwarfed by the Permian.\n\nE&Ps seeking a longer runway in U.S. shale in 2025 will need to get creative, said Andrew Dittmar, director at Enverus Intelligence Research.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tough market for buyers in \u201825 in terms of finding assets,\u201d Dittmar told Oil and Gas Investor, \u201cwhether you\u2019re looking in the Permian or elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nShale Consolidation Aftermath: The Field Narrows\n\nPriced out of paradise\n\nEvery E&P wishes it had more Permian Basin drilling locations.\n\nPermian wells have some of the lowest breakeven costs of any U.S. shale play. Layers and layers of stacked pay give producers many shots on goal to co-develop multiple benches. Permian-heavy E&P names boast higher market values and trading multiples in the public markets.\n\nProducers big and small clamor for a bigger slice of the Permian, the nation\u2019s only real driver of oil output growth, but asking prices for Permian assets are sky high. That\u2019s leading some cost-conscious producers to turn away from the basin and look elsewhere for new value.\n\nSM Energy, Ovintiv and Devon Energy illustrated this trend in the back half of 2024.\n\nEach of those E&Ps were rumored to be on the hunt for new Permian acquisitions\u2014part of a broader M&A wave sweeping across the sector.\n\nUltimately, each company decided to spurn high Permian prices in favor of more compelling returns in other basins.\n\nInstead of doubling down on the Midland Basin, SM Energy set its sights on the Uinta Basin. SM teamed up with non-operated partner Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) to acquire leading Uinta producer XCL Resources for $2.6 billion.\n\nSM acquired an 80% undivided interest in XCL\u2019s assets for $2.1 billion, while NOG picked\n\nup the remaining 20% non-op stake.\n\nBuilding on the Uinta M&A momentum, Ovintiv decided to sell its Uinta assets for $2 billion to FourPoint Resources, a privately-held E&P.\n\nInstead of buying Double Eagle IV in the Permian, Ovintiv decided to enlarge its presence in Canada\u2019s Montney Shale through a US$2.38 billion (CA$3.33 billion) deal with Paramount Resources.\n\nDespite their expansions in the Permian, both companies opted to take a breather from the Permian\u2019s high prices and look outside the basin for value, said Matthew Bernstein, vice president and manager of upstream solutions for Rystad Energy.\n\nDevon Energy was also rumored to be scouring the Permian for deals when it announced a $5 billion acquisition of Grayson Mill Energy in the Williston Basin.\n\nThe Grayson Mill deal added 500 gross undrilled Williston locations, and around 300 candidates for potential refrac projects. Around 80% of the new locations were in the Bakken Shale, the remaining 20% in the deeper Three Forks benches.\n\n\u201cAs those Permian assets get a bit more expensive, a bit riskier and harder to come by, you do see more companies being willing to look at other basins,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate part is there\u2019s not a whole lot to find in those, either,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a plethora of assets to go buy in the Eagle Ford or the Williston.\u201d\n\nEnverus forecasts that 2025\u2019s M&A environment will include smaller deals and deals further up the cost curve, or looking at less economic, lower-tier rock, Dittmar said.\n\nForeground: FBIR 13-24H well; Background: Patterson-UTI Drilling #336 on the George Evans 11-2H well in Mountrail County, North Dakota.

Production from the mature Williston Basin actually shows signs of plateauing and declining, Williston wildcatter Harold Hamm told OGI late last year.\n\nWilliston operators are focusing on drilling more efficiently and lowering their costs instead of growing output at a breakneck pace. Producers are optimizing development of the Williston\u2019s secondary benches, the Three Forks zones, which underly the shallower Bakken Shale.\n\nHistorically, the Middle Bakken has been the Williston Basin\u2019s top drilling target. Williston operators like Hamm\u2019s Continental Resources began landing laterals in the upper Three Forks as geologic understanding of the play grew over time.\n\nThe major stratigraphic formations of the core Williston Basin; PICTURED: Gamma-ray wireline log example of the Bakken-Three Forks section with core-plug oil and water saturation data from Enerplus Resource\u2019s Hognose 152-94-18B-19H-TF. (Source: North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources)\n\nBut new research suggests major undeveloped upside remains in deeper parts of the Three Forks bench.\n\nOperators had only landed 40 laterals in the middle (second) and lower (third) Three Forks benches through August 2023, according to studies published by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.\n\nThat represents only around 2% of total drilling activity in the entire Williston Basin, authors Timothy Nesheim and Edward Starns reported.\n\nBut data collected from 25 drilling spacing units (DSUs) shows co-development of the middle Three Forks bench \u201cexhibited a clear volumetric addition of oil\u201d compared to DSUs without middle Three Forks wells.\n\nNot counting existing wells, another 604 middle Three Forks horizontals could still be drilled within the core of the Williston Basin, according to the study. Ultimate EURs for the new projects could range between 165 MMbbl and 410 MMbbl of oil.\n\nWilliston operators are also combining land positions to drill longer laterals underground.\n\nDevon plans to sustain production from the acquired Grayson Mill asset at around 100,000 boe/d this year through a mix of 2- and 3-mile laterals, as well as \u201ctactical refracs\u201d to supplement the base output, Devon COO Clay Gaspar said during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call.\n\n\u201cThe Williston Basin has been a tremendous provider of energy for a long time,\u201d said William Westler, Rockies business unit vice president for Devon, in a statement to OGI. \u201cWe are excited and confident that the Grayson Mill acquisition allows us to continue to expand our production and operating scale with additional highly economic drilling inventory in the Williston for years to come.\u201d\n\nAfter closing a $4 billion acquisition of fellow Williston operator Enerplus, Chord Energy planned to drill more 3-mile wells and aimed to begin drilling 4-mile Bakken laterals.\n\nFormentera Energy Partners, founded by partner Bryan Sheffield, is watching nearby operators drill 3- and 4-mile laterals from its position in Divide County, North Dakota, Sheffield said at Hart Energy\u2019s Energy Capital Conference in October.\n\n\u201cParticularly in the Williston,\u201d Dittmar said, \u201cbeing able to go from a 2-mile to a 3-mile lateral knocks about $5 off your breakeven.\u201d\n\nDespite the runway to be had in the Williston, there aren\u2019t many obvious places to go after it. The acquisitions of Grayson Mill and Enerplus plucked two large Williston positions from the drawing board.\n\nThe $17.1 billion merger of ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil also consolidated huge swathes of Williston Basin acreage.\n\nWilliston producers of notable scale that could be potential sellers include Kraken Resources, Slawson Exploration and Zavanna LLC.\n\nPrivate equity firm Carnelian Energy Capital invested in Zavanna last fall. The company has around 150 drilling locations across the Bakken and Three Forks.\n\nKraken Resources, Slawson Exploration and Zavanna stand out as notable private producers remaining in the Williston Basin. (Source: Rextag)\n\nRELATED\n\nAnalysis: Middle Three Forks Bench Holds Vast Untapped Oil Potential\n\nEagle Ford flies\n\nA growing list of Eagle Ford operators are leaning into refracs, re-entries, recompletions or other re-do jobs to breathe new life into legacy wells with declining production.\n\nEagle Ford producers touting refrac projects include ConocoPhillips, Devon, BPX Energy, Crescent Energy, Baytex Energy and Verdun Oil, among others.\n\nRefracs are a hot topic today. For Verdun Oil, backed by private equity firm EnCap Investments, they\u2019re old news.\n\nVerdun started developing a refrac strategy around 2018, when the company completed what it says was the first full linear isolation refrac job performed in the Eagle Ford trend.\n\nA cemented linear refrac involves installing a new liner inside the wells\u2019 existing casing, which covers all the previous fracs. Then, the well is fracked as if it were a new project.\n\nThe other main type of refrac\u2014bullhead refracs\u2014do not direct frac fluid and are less costly alternatives to a full linear isolation refrac project.\n\nNot every well makes sense for a refrac. The wells Verdun has singled out for refracs generally have lateral lengths of around 6,000 ft and were completed prior to 2016.\n\nM&A horizon\n\nLike the Williston, the Eagle Ford holds fewer obvious combinations through potential M&A.\n\nThe merger between ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil brought together two of the largest Eagle Ford producers.\n\nThe Marathon deal added around 1,000 Eagle Ford locations to ConocoPhillips\u2019 portfolio. The companies have touted an even longer Eagle Ford runway, including potential refracs in the play.\n\nConocoPhillips\u2019 merger with Marathon Oil created one of the top producers and landowners in the Eagle Ford Shale. (Source: ConocoPhillips)\n\nCrescent Energy has been an active consolidator in the southern and central Eagle Ford. In its largest deal last year, Crescent closed a $2.1 billion acquisition of SilverBow Resources.\n\nCrescent added assets through a $905 million acquisition of private E&P Ridgemar Energy in late 2024, complementing a smattering of other smaller transactions in the play.\n\nMagnolia Oil & Gas has been a buyer in the more northern Austin Chalk play. The company added acreage in the storied Giddings Field through smaller M&A deals last year.\n\nBut the potential for large-scale M&A in the Eagle Ford this year is still relatively limited.\n\nStandout targets remaining in the basin include Verdun Oil and WildFire Energy. WildFire has been another active buyer in the Austin Chalk, near Magnolia\u2019s position.\n\nLewis Energy Group, a private operator in the Eagle Ford\u2019s gas window, has been a seller recently. Last September, TotalEnergies announced acquiring a 45% stake in dry gas assets operated by Lewis.\n\nKimmeridge Texas Gas (KTG), a gas producer backed by investment firm Kimmeridge, also aims to grow through M&A in the Eagle Ford.\n\nKTG had hoped to acquire SilverBow, one of its nearby neighbors. But those efforts were rejected\u2014in a high-profile back-and-forth between Kimmeridge and SilverBow\u2014when SilverBow agreed to the deal with Crescent.\n\nVerdun Oil and WildFire Energy stand out as notable private producers remaining in the Eagle Ford.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this energy company have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which ConocoPhillips belongs, has gained 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nConocoPhillips is expected to post earnings of $1.89 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -21.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +15%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -12.9%. This estimate has changed +4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.31 indicates a change of +8.8% from what ConocoPhillips is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ConocoPhillips is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when ConocoPhillips (COP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $14.68 billion, down 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14.96% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

However, activity tumbled in the back half of the year with $9.6 billion of upstream M&A recorded in 4Q24, the fourth consecutive decline in quarterly value.\n\n\"Deal value and volume continued to drop in the final quarter of 2024 from its peak at the end of 2023 as buyers grappled with fewer M&A targets to pursue. There are also quite a few larger E&Ps working to integrate their previous deals before returning to market to acquire more,\" said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at EIR. \"Increased volatility in oil prices may have also deterred some buyers, while there is rising enthusiasm for gas and gas-weighted assets to feed burgeoning demand from LNG and data centers.\"\n\nThe most notable shift in the just-completed quarter was the lack of consolidation between publicly traded E&Ps, the first time that has happened in a quarter since 2022. The $188 billion in public company consolidation since the start of 2023, with 11 public deals over $2 billion, leaves significantly fewer targets to pursue. In addition, large buyers like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Diamondback Energy and ExxonMobil have been busy closing and integrating deals, with timelines often delayed by extra anti-trust scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\"While corporate M&A has slowed, the industry is not done consolidating. If you look out a few years from now, there are going to be fewer companies operating in the main U.S. shale plays,\" said Dittmar.",

            "content": "EOG Resources currently distributes an annual dividend of $3.90 per share and an extra dividend that depends on its free cash flow (not allocated in 3Q24). For this quarter, the company increased the base dividend by 7%, raising it to $0.975 per share, resulting in a yield of 2.77%. Additionally, EOG Resources has announced a $5 billion share repurchase program this quarter, which will be added to the $1.8 billion that remained at the end of the third quarter.\n\nSince the end of 2020, EOG has generated more than $22 billion of free cash flow and more than $25 billion in adjusted net income. We've increased our regular dividend rate by 160%, including both regular and special dividends paid or committed to pay more than $13 billion directly to shareholders and $3.2 billion indirectly through share repurchases, all while reducing debt 35%.\n\nAlthough we cannot control future events, we can prepare by investing in companies with strong fundamentals that consistently meet market expectations. EOG is an excellent choice that offers stability and excellence.CEO Ezra Jacob said in the third quarter conference call:\n\nEOG Resources is particularly adapted to profit from any gas price increase, with gas infrastructure connecting production to premium markets. Also, EOG Resources enjoys three main gas sales agreements shown below:\n\nAs we enter this new year, geopolitical factors are set to have an increasingly important impact. The incoming US President, Donald Trump, has already made waves in the market, even before officially taking office. While Trump's position on oil policy is evident, how effectively it can be implemented remains uncertain. Trump aims to increase oil production in the US, but is this goal realistic, or is it merely a political statement lacking substance? Time will tell. The outlook for gas in the U.S. seems more favorable than oil in 2025, with Europe and Asia being the primary beneficiaries. However, concerns about inflation may negatively impact oil and gas prices in 2025.\n\nThis article focuses on EOG Resources ( NYSE:EOG ), my portfolio's third domestic oil producer. With Occidental Petroleum ( NYSE:OXY ) and Diamondback Energy ( NASDAQ:FANG ), this trio completes my extensive Permian oil portfolio, which I trade regularly.The trio's notable success and substantial ownership in Permian production establish them as one of the most influential domestic players in the Permian Basin. Major oil companies like Chevron Corporation ( NYSE:CVX ), ConocoPhillips (COP), and ExxonMobil ( NYSE:XOM ) are also important players in the region. While other oil companies meet these criteria, investors seeking stability and strong underlying fundamentals would be best served by investing in these strong names.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2: The Permian Basin is the number one producer of oil in the US.\n\nThe Permian Basin is one of the most productive and longest-operating oil basins in the United States. While it has reached maturity and is approaching its peak production level, there is still the potential for some increases in production in 2025.\n\nThe EIA projects that Permian production will reach 6.6 million barrels of oil equivalent by 2025, an increase of nearly 5% year over year. Reserves suggest that substantial production will persist until 2030.\n\nMany large oil and gas operators are now exploring tier 2 and tier 3 acreage, which tend to be more gas-heavy, to help offset the flattening production from their tier 1 acreage.While EOG Resources does not exclusively produce oil and gas in the Permian Basin like Diamondback Energy, it maintains a strong overall production in the U.S., with significant output in the Permian that was not indicated in the company's filings.\n\nThe map below from the EOG Resources website shows that the Permian basin is one of many company's producing segments.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nSource: EOG website.\n\nIn addition to the two oil supermajors, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, which I will discuss later, many US E&P companies operate in the Permian. Below are a few companies that use US production versus Permian production.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\n3: Oil Production in 3Q24. Reaching another record.\n\nTotal oil equivalent production was 1,075.7 K Boepd in 3Q24, with production in the USA at 1,037.1 K Boepd and 38.6 K Boepd in Trinidad. As the chart below shows, EOG Resources has regularly increased its production since 2020.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nEOG estimates total production will range from 1,058 to 1,067.8 K Boepd in 2024. Additionally, it anticipates production of 1,084.5 to 1,113.2 K Boepd for the fourth quarter, another record.Oil production is 45.8% of the total output, lower than Diamondback Energy's 56.2% and Occidental Petroleum's 50.5%. This emphasizes the need for EOG to secure higher gas prices.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nEOG Resources is achieving better prices for its oil and gas than its competitors. In 3Q24, the EOG composite oil price was $76.92, OXY's was $75.33, and FANG's was $73.13. The difference is even more striking when it comes to gas prices. EOG's composite gas price was $2.05 per mcf, OXY's was $0.76, and FANG's was in the negative range.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nEOG's key highlight is its low operating costs, significantly enhancing profit margins. In 3Q24, the total operating cost was $24.98 per Boe, achieving a composite average margin of $23.36.It is what a savvy investor should focus on when it comes to investing long-term.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nSource: EOG Resources\n\n4: EOG Resources: Solid fundamentals and no net debt.\n\nEOG Resources announced that its adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.89, exceeding analysts' expectations. However, earnings fell by 16% compared to $3.44 from the same quarter last year. The total quarterly revenue was $5,965 million, which did not meet estimates.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nThe mixed results were driven by increased oil-equivalent production volumes, which led to better-than-expected quarterly earnings. However, this boost was partially offset by lower prices for crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids (NGL).\n\nThe company reported a free cash flow of $2,086 million in the third quarter, a significant increase from the $1,186 million earned in the same quarter last year. Cash flow from operations amounted to $3,588 million, and capital expenditures totaled $1,502 million.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nNote: The company calculates free cash flow differently. The total for the first nine months of 2024 was $4,373 million, but the company indicated $4,100 million.I refer to free cash flow compared to EBITDA ($3,196 million in 3Q24) because it directly addresses the actual cash generated by a company's operations.In my view, free cash flow (FCF) offers a more robust foundation for evaluating a company's long-term growth potential and its capability to create sustainable value. It showcases the company's ability to invest in its operations, manage debt, and reward shareholders over time.\n\nCFO Ann Janssen said in the conference call:\n\nYear to date, we have generated $4.1 billion of free cash flow, which helped fund $3.8 billion of cash returned to shareholders. Of that $3.8 billion, $1.6 billion was paid in regular dividends, which were complemented by $2.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter.\n\nEOG Resources ended the third quarter with $6.122 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, an increase from $5.326 billion in the previous quarter. The company's long-term debt was approximately $3.776 billion (including current debt), remaining relatively stable compared to $3.806 billion in the previous quarter.\n\nEOG Resources has a net cash position of $2.34 billion, which is quite impressive and unusual. In comparison, Occidental Petroleum has a net debt of approximately $24.09 billion, while Diamondback Energy has a net debt of $12.8 billion.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\n5: Technical Analysis.\n\nEOG Resources: Strong Fundamentals, But High Valuation\n\nNote: The chart has been adjusted to account for the dividend.\n\nEOG follows a new ascending channel pattern, with resistance at $137 and support at $129.50. The relative strength index (RSI) is 57, indicating a bearish retracement in progress. Following a breakout in early January, EOG retested the previously mentioned new resistance level and is now retracing to its support.\n\nConsider gradually selling some of your shares while the price is between $136 and $138. Depending on your position, I recommend selling about 15% to 20% in this price range and selling more if the rally has legs using the resistance as a new support buy.\n\nI suggest using a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) strategy for 5060% of your position, targeting a final price of around $155. This percentage is advisable due to the sector's significant volatility, which will be exacerbated in 2025.\n\nAn ascending channel is commonly regarded as a bullish continuation pattern. However, investors should pay attention to how this pattern ultimately concludes. In this case, the likelihood of a breakout or breakdown is equal, which introduces uncertainty and supports a last-in, first-out (LIFO) strategy. See the chart for more information.\n\nI would add to my position if EOG trades below $131, specifically around $128-$129 at the 50MA.Note: You must frequently update the TA chart to remain relevant, as we operate in a constantly changing environment.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The company plans to announce its earnings on February 6, 2025. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.89, marking a 21.25% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $14.72 billion, indicating a 3.84% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for ConocoPhillips. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 4.08% upward. At present, ConocoPhillips boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note ConocoPhillips's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 12.24. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 15.91 of its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that COP has a PEG ratio of 0.78. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 3.22 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAs a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$5.2b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 6.2% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or \"liquidity providers\" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell ConocoPhillips which might hurt individual investors.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about ConocoPhillips.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ConocoPhillips\n\nNYSE:COP Ownership Breakdown January 27th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ConocoPhillips?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that ConocoPhillips does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at ConocoPhillips' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:COP Earnings and Revenue Growth January 27th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ConocoPhillips. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.2% of the company stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.",

The mammoth 369-page Decision of Annulment, handed down by tribunal president Judge Dominique Hascher of France, dismissed Venezuela\u2019s claims against the 2019 award, with Venezuela further ordered to cover the company\u2019s legal fees of USD 6.46 million and court costs of USD 1.35 million. The decision, which closes the door on the possibility of further appeals, was succinct in its conclusion, stating: \u201cVenezuela\u2019s applications to annul the award are dismissed.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nThe dispute has its roots in Venezuela\u2019s nationalisation policies which were put in place by the administration of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela who served as president from 1999 until 2013. In 2007, in accordance with its policy to exert state control over the oil industry, chiefly via nationalisation, the Venezuelan government assumed control of major energy assets, including the Corocoro offshore oil field and the heavy crude upgrader facilities Hamaca and Petrozuata, which were partly owned by ConocoPhillips. However, the Houston-headquartered fossil-fuel giant, unlike some of its competitors, refused to accept the terms of the legislation and subsequently pursued international arbitration.\n\nIn 2019, an ICSID tribunal ruled in favour of ConocoPhillips, awarding the company substantial compensation for the expropriation of its assets. Venezuela appealed the decision, arguing that the tribunal had been improperly constituted, overstepped its authority and misapplied the compensation framework. The appeal also challenged the exclusion of certain evidence, which Caracas claimed could have altered the outcome. However, the three-member tribunal rejected all of Venezuela\u2019s arguments, maintaining that the excluded evidence would not have impacted the determination of damages.\n\nTHE APPEAL\n\nNearly six years after the initial award, ConocoPhillips was once again victorious, welcoming the 22 January decision to dismiss Venezuela\u2019s appeal as a victory for private investors that \"upholds the principle that governments cannot unlawfully expropriate private investments without paying compensation\u201d. Unsurprisingly, George Kahale of the New York City office Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, representing Venezuela, did not agree, describing the decision in a statement as indicative of a lack of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d in the arbitration process.\n\nThe USD 8.5 billion award attracts a 5.5 per cent annual interest rate, swelling the liability beyond USD 11 billion and contributing to the existing crippling financial strain on Venezuela, which in 2018 had already been ordered by an ICC International Court of Arbitration (ICC) tribunal to pay USD 2 billion to ConocoPhillips in respect of other nationalised projects. While the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro administration began paying off the ICC award in instalments, these were guillotined when US sanctions obstructed Venezuela\u2019s ability to make international financial transactions.\n\nConocoPhillips has since taken multiple steps to collect on its arbitration awards. Both the ICSID and ICC claims have been included in an ongoing court-ordered auction of CITGO, Venezuela\u2019s US-based refining subsidiary. The Delaware court overseeing the auction recently restarted the bidding process following controversy over an earlier offer by New York fund manager Elliott Management and, should the auction be successful, proceeds from the sale will now be channelled directly to ConocoPhillips with Venezuela having no further say in the matter.\n\nTHE PARTIES\n\nIn Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (applicant) v ConocoPhillips (respondent), the applicant was represented by Attorney General Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza of the Venezuelan government, Alfredo De Jes\u00fas of De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas (Caracas) and a team from Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, led by George Kahale.\n\nTeams led by Elliot Friedman of Freshfields (New York), and Constantine Partasides KC and Luke Sobota (Three Crowns, London and Washington, DC, respectively) represented the respondent.",

(Reuters)\n\nCaracas, January 26, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 The World Bank\u2019s state-corporate arbitration tribunal has dismissed Venezuela\u2019s challenge against a US $8.5 billion arbitration award granted to ConocoPhillips.\n\nOn Friday, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) issued a 356-page ruling rejecting Caracas\u2019 request to annul the award. Venezuela was also ordered to reimburse the company\u2019s $6.46 million in legal fees and $1.35 million in other court costs.\n\n\u201cVenezuela\u2019s applications to annul the award are dismissed,\u201d the document read. The case does not allow for further appeals.\n\nIn 2019, ConocoPhillips secured a favorable ruling and multi-billion compensation for the nationalization of its Venezuela-based assets.\n\nThe Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government\u2019s appeal argued that the tribunal was improperly constituted, exceeded its powers and misapplied the compensation mechanism. It likewise objected to the exclusion of evidence.\n\nThe three-person tribunal board rejected the claims and stated that the excluded evidence would not have affected its assessment of damages.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s counsel, George Kahale III of Curtis Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP, labeled the ICSID\u2019s decision as evidence that \u201cthe necessary checks and balances of a mature legal system\u201d are lacking. Caracas\u2019 legal team had previously brought up an alleged lack of impartiality from the ad hoc committee overseeing the ConocoPhillips case, but saw the claim ruled out as well.\n\nIn contrast, the US oil giant welcomed the latest ruling as \u201cupholding the principle that governments cannot unlawfully expropriate private investments without paying compensation.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez government took control of the offshore oil field Corocoro and heavy crude upgraders Hamaca and Petrozuata. ConocoPhillips was one of the corporations that did not accept Venezuela\u2019s reformed oil legislation which imposed increased state control over the industry.\n\nThe Texas-headquartered corporation pursued international arbitration to challenge the loss of its assets. Though Venezuela abandoned the ICSID convention in 2012, it remained liable for priorly launched cases. The tribunal reached a verdict in 2019 following years of litigation.\n\nThe original $8.7 billion award was later lowered to $8.5 billion and has a 5.5 percent yearly interest rate which has seen the total debt balloon past $11 billion.\n\nConocoPhillips likewise secured a separate $2 billion award from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 2018 as compensation for its nationalized projects and investments. The Maduro government began paying the debt in installments before US sanctions barred the country from performing international financial transactions.\n\nThe oil corporation has launched multiple efforts to collect on its arbitration awards. Both claims were included in an ongoing court-mandated auction of Venezuela\u2019s US-based refiner CITGO to pay creditors. Delaware Judge Leonard Stark recently ordered a restart of the bidding process in the wake of controversy over the amount and sale terms from a winning offer by vulture fund Elliott Management.\n\nConocoPhillips\u2019 ICC award is second on a list of claims that the auction will satisfy on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis. It managed to tag its ICSID award onto the Delaware proceedings in December 2023 following a favorable \u201calter ego\u201d ruling.\n\nThe company had been allowed to enforce the award, despite the ongoing appeals process, by a Washington DC court in late 2021. ConocoPhillips won a default ruling after lawyers representing the Juan Guaid\u00f3-led self-proclaimed \u201cinterim government\u201d failed to appear in court for over a year. Washington\u2019s recognition of the parallel administration saw Venezuela\u2019s hardline opposition assume control of US-based assets and legal cases.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 and associates drew further accusations of conflicts of interest and malpractice, including an alleged off-court settlement concerning the ICC award brought up during the Delaware process. The agreement was denied and struck from court documents with no explanation.\n\nIn May 2024, ConocoPhillips received a favorable legal ruling in Trinidad and Tobago that could see the enterprise attempt to seize Venezuelan proceeds from joint natural gas projects.",

In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

            "content": "Last year was a relatively calm period for the oil market. Demand was healthy while OPEC kept a tight lid on its supplies, which supported prices. However, this year could be a different story. Oil market forecasters see the potential for geopolitical risks relating to Russia and Iran, which could put upward pressure on crude prices. That could give oil stocks the fuel to rally.\n\nMost investors likely only want to hold one oil company in their portfolio. To help narrow the list, a few Fool.com contributors have compiled a list of their top oil stocks for investors to consider this year: Chevron (CVX 0.62%), ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.41%). Here's a closer look at why these three stand out from their peers in the oil patch.\n\nChevron rides the wave like a pro\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Chevron): Oil and natural gas prices are very volatile. That's something all investors in the energy patch need to understand and, perhaps more importantly, prepare for. Integrated energy giant Chevron is a great way to prepare if you are a buy-and-hold type investor.\n\nFor starters, Chevron's integrated business model is all about diversification. Its portfolio spans the globe and extends from the upstream (oil production) through the midstream (pipelines) and all the way into the downstream (chemicals and refining). This helps soften the peaks and valleys inherent to the energy sector because each segment of the industry performs differently over time.\n\nOn top of that, Chevron has a rock-solid balance sheet with minimal leverage. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is currently a very modest 0.17. Modest leverage allows the company to take on debt during the inevitable downturns to support the business and shareholder dividends. Today, Chevron appears very well prepared for the next oil industry downturn.\n\nThe overall strength of Chevron's business approach is shown most clearly in the company's dividend history. Despite the cyclical nature of the energy sector, Chevron has increased its dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. You can't build a record like that without having a resilient business and strong business model. Add in a 4% dividend yield, and you have the kind of buy-and-hold investment that even a conservative dividend investor could love.\n\nConocoPhillips gets an acquisition-fueled boost\n\nMatt DiLallo (ConocoPhillips): ConocoPhillips has compiled a treasure trove of low-cost oil and gas resources. It entered last year with a resource base of 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) with an average cost of supply of $32 per barrel.\n\nBecause of that, the company can produce a lot of cash in the current environment where crude oil prices are in the $70s. ConocoPhillips generated $14.9 billion of cash flow from operations through the first nine months of last year, selling its production at an average of $55.77 per BOE (and $78.88 per barrel of crude oil). That gave it the money to fund capital expenditures and investments ($8.8 billion), repurchase shares ($3.5 billion), and pay dividends ($2.7 billion).\n\nIt also repaid $500 million of debt at maturity for good measure. It ended the period in excellent financial shape, with $7.1 billion of cash and short-term investments and another $1 billion of long-term investments on its balance sheet.\n\nSince then, the oil company has enhanced its ability to produce low-cost oil and gas by closing its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. The deal added over 2 billion barrels of resources with an average cost of supply below $30 per barrel. ConocoPhillips expects the deal will be immediately accretive to its cash from operations and free cash flow. In addition, it expects to capture more than $1 billion of cost and capital synergies within the first year, more than double its initial projection.\n\nThe enhanced free cash flow from that Marathon deal will enable ConocoPhillips to return more cash to investors this year. It raised its dividend by 34% and is ramping up its annual share repurchase rate from $5 billion to $7 billion. This combination of earnings growth and increased cash return could give ConocoPhillips the fuel to outperform its peers in the oil patch this year.\n\nMultiple catalysts could fuel a turnaround\n\nNeha Chamaria (Occidental Petroleum): I'll start with a caveat: Shares of Occidental Petroleum have been under pressure for nearly three quarters now, and there's a chance the stock could fall further in the short term. That's because crude oil prices continued to fall in the fourth quarter of 2024, and that'll likely reflect in the oil and gas giant's Q4 numbers when they are announced in mid-February. Yet, if investors look beyond the headlines and focus on Occidental's debt and cash flows instead, they'll realize why this stock is a buy on dips.\n\nAlthough lower oil prices hit Occidental's earnings in recent quarters, the stock also took a hit because of a sudden spurt in its debt. When Occidental acquired CrownRock for nearly $12 billion in August 2024, it funded almost 75% of its acquisition price with fresh debt.\n\nWhile it's hard to predict where oil prices will go, Occidental is doing what it should right now: bringing down debt while extracting value from CrownRock assets. Occidental repaid $4 billion in debt in less than three months after the acquisition, hitting 90% of its short-term debt-reduction goal significantly ahead of target.\n\nDuring Occidental's third-quarter earnings conference call, CEO Vicki Hollub predicted that the company should still be able to generate cash flows to cut debt further in 2025, even if oil prices remain low. Aside from potential divestitures, CrownRock -- which expanded Occidental's presence in the Permian and Midland basins -- should also contribute to the company's cash flows this year. That should also support higher dividends in 2025, making Occidental Petroleum one oil stock that could turn around in 2025.",

However, it has cooled off since then and is currently in the mid-$70s.\n\nThe price of crude oil has a meaningful impact on oil stocks. Here's a look at whether it's still worth buying shares of ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) now that oil has dipped below $80 a barrel again.\n\nCashing in on crude oil\n\nConocoPhillips is one of the world's leading exploration and production companies. Its oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) production averaged over 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day in the third quarter of last year. The company sold its oil for an average of $76.77 during that period and its total output for an average of $54.18 per BOE. That price point enabled the company to generate $4.7 billion in cash from operations. It used that money to invest in expanding its operations, pay dividends ($900 million), repurchase shares ($1.2 billion), and maintain a strong balance sheet ($7.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the period).\n\nAs its results last quarter showcase, ConocoPhillips can produce a lot of cash when crude oil is in the $70s. Through the first nine months of last year, it generated $14.9 billion of cash from operations. It produced an average of 1.9 million BOE per day, which it sold for an average of $55.77 per BOE (and $78.88 per barrel of oil). It used that cash to fully cover its capital expenditures and investments ($8.8 billion), repurchase shares ($3.5 billion), and pay dividends ($2.7 billion). The company also used some of the cash it built up on its balance sheet to repay $500 million of debt at maturity.\n\nConocoPhillips can generate that much cash at an oil price below $80 because of its low cost of supply. It has about 20 billion barrels of resources with a cost of supply of $40 per barrel or lower, with an average cost of supply of $32 per barrel. With crude prices in the $70s, ConocoPhillips can produce a lot of cash.\n\nEnhancing its already low-cost oil business\n\nConocoPhillips is in an even better position to cash in on the current oil price environment than last year. That's because it has now closed its $22.5 billion acquisition of Marathon Oil. CEO Ryan Lance commented on the acquisition when the company announced the deal last May. He noted, \"This acquisition of Marathon Oil further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading U.S. unconventional position.\" Overall, the company added over 2 billion barrels of resources with an estimated average cost of supply below $30 per barrel.\n\nIn addition to the low-cost production, the deal is immediately accretive to the company's cash flow from operations and free cash flow. On top of that, ConocoPhillips expects to capture more than $1 billion in cost and capital synergies within the first full year of closing the transaction, which occurred at the end of November. That's double the $500 million it initially expected.\n\nThat outlook drives the company's view that it can return more cash to investors in the future. It has already increased its dividend by 34%. It plans to deliver dividend growth in the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the future. ConocoPhillips also plans to ramp up its share repurchase rate from over $5 billion annually to more than $7 billion per year.\n\nStill a buy at sub-$80 oil\n\nConocoPhillips has loads of low-cost oil, even more so after adding Marathon's low-cost supplies. That enables the company to produce lots of cash when crude oil is in the $70s. Because of that, the oil stock is still a buy after oil's recent dip from $80, especially since the Marathon deal will enable it to produce even more cash at a lower price point.",

            "content": "Crude oil prices are expected to slip in 2025, continuing the trend from 2024, which saw prices dragged down by weak Chinese demand and a supply glut. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted global oil demand to grow by under a million barrels per day in 2025, a significant slowdown compared to the two million barrels per day increase in 2023. Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects Brent oil prices to fall to $70 per barrel this year, citing increased oil supply from non-OPEC+ countries that will likely outpace the rise in global oil consumption. BMI noted that the first half of 2025 is likely to see a supply glut as substantial new production from the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil comes online. If OPEC+ plans to roll back voluntary cuts materialize, the oversupply will further pressure prices.\n\nGlobal natural gas prices have rallied since mid-December 2024, driven by cold weather and geopolitical tensions. Ukraine\u2019s recent halt of Russian gas flow to several European nations on New Year\u2019s Day has introduced greater uncertainty to the global gas markets. As long as the cutoff remains in place, gas prices are likely to remain elevated. BMI forecasts gas prices to rise by about 40% in 2025 to $3.4 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), driven by growing demand from the LNG sector and higher net pipeline exports. LNG will continue to drive new consumption, supported by rising export capacity and strong demand in Europe and Asia, according to BMI analysts.\n\nGold prices, which notched a series of all-time highs in 2024, are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2025. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, a gold investment services firm, attributes this optimism to investors\u2019 pessimism about geopolitics and government debt. Gold\u2019s role as a hedge against risk and inflation makes it an attractive asset in uncertain times. JPMorgan analysts also forecast a rise in gold prices, particularly if U.S. policies become more disruptive, leading to increased tariffs, elevated trade tensions, and higher risks to economic growth. Gold prices, which rose about 26% in 2024, are forecast to reach $3,000 per ounce in 2025.\n\nAccording to Sabrin Chowdhury, the head of commodities analysis at BMI, commodities in general will face pressure across the board in 2025. The strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to cap demand for commodities priced in the greenback, making them more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by a sluggish global economic outlook, which will dampen demand for raw materials and energy resources.\n\nThe year 2025 is shaping up to be a mixed bag for commodity markets. While global commodity prices are largely expected to fall due to a sluggish economic outlook and a resurgent U.S. dollar, certain commodities such as gold and gas are poised for a rally. Industry experts and market participants are closely monitoring these trends, particularly in the context of China\u2019s economic policies and global geopolitical developments.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ) stands against other best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSilver is expected to see price increases in 2025, driven by strong industrial demand. Silver is used in a variety of applications, including solar panels, automobiles, jewelry, and electronics. The demand for solar power, in particular, is expected to remain resilient, and the metal\u2019s supply is limited.\n\nCopper, a key material in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and power grids, may see a dent in prices in 2025. The metal reached a record high in May 2024, largely due to a squeezed market and the global energy transition. However, a potential deceleration in the energy transition, driven by policy shifts, might dampen the \u201cgreen sentiment\u201d that bolstered prices in 2024. John Gross, president of John Gross and Company, a metals management consultancy, expects copper prices to trend lower in 2025 due to a cocktail mix of high interest rates, elevated interest rates, and a stronger dollar, which will weigh on all metals markets.\n\nIron ore prices are forecast to drop in 2025, driven by an oversupply resulting from Chinese policies and geopolitical factors. Goldman Sachs expects prices to decline to $95 per ton in 2025, citing the expected U.S. tariffs on China, the changing nature of Chinese stimulus, and the introduction of new low-cost supply. Despite China likely importing a record amount of iron ore this year, the market is expected to move into a surplus, leading to a decline in prices.\n\nThe global commodity markets in 2025 are expected to be characterized by a mix of trends, with some commodities facing headwinds while others continue to rally. However, commodities are a solid investment option due to their inherent scarcity and long-term value as demand continues to grow.\n\nIs ConocoPhillips (COP) Among the Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?\n\nAn underground network of pipelines transporting oil through an expansive terrain.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used commodities ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies that are involved in mining, trading or processing of commodities.

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. owned 40 percent, while Shell Energy Asia Ltd. held 30 percent. ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas Ltd. has now increased its ownership from 30 percent to 100 percent.\n\nThe cluster contributed 47 million cubic feet a day of natural gas and 1,000 barrels per day of oil to ConocoPhillips\u2019 2023 production, according to a fact sheet published online by the Houston, Texas-based company.\n\nKebabangan started production late 2014.

With a market cap of $119.7 billion , ConocoPhillips specializes in crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, operating across six continents. The company is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday, Feb. 6.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect ConocoPhillips to announce a profit of $1.86 per share , down 22.5% from $2.40 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The company has surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS projections in three of the past four quarters while missing on one other occasion.\n\nIts adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share in the last reported quarter outpaced the consensus estimates by 6%. Cost efficiencies and production management drove ConocoPhillips's earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts expect the energy company to report an EPS of $7.65 in fiscal 2024, down 12.8% from $8.77 in fiscal 2023 . However, its EPS is projected to grow 4.4% year over year to $7.99 in fiscal 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips' shares have declined 3.7% over the past 52 weeks, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 25.8% gains and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s ( XLE ) 14.3% returns over the same period.\n\nConocoPhillips has faced underperformance due to regulatory scrutiny surrounding its Marathon Oil acquisition, oil price volatility, and post-acquisition integration challenges. Despite these hurdles, the company\u2019s shares surged 6.4% after its Q3 earnings release on Oct. 31. Revenue dropped 12.1% year-over-year to $13.6 billion, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s projection of $14.46 billion. The company generated $5.8 billion in cash generated from operating activities and $4.7 billion in cash from operations (CFO).\n\nThe consensus opinion on ConocoPhillips stock is bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall.

Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.94% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through February 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The decision upholds the principle that governments cannot unlawfully expropriate private investments without paying compensation,\" Conoco said in an email.\n\nVenezuela's communication ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nConoco brought the arbitration before ICSID in 2007 after Chavez' government took over three oil projects where the company had stakes - Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro.\n\nFollowing two victories at international arbitration courts over Venezuela and its state-owned company PDVSA, Conoco has in recent years tried to seize Venezuelan assets overseas.\n\nThe firm last year asked a court in Trinidad and Tobago to seize payments to Venezuela from joint offshore gas projects.\n\n\"We remain committed to pursuing all available legal avenues to protect our rights and obtain a full and fair recovery of the awards,\" Conoco added in the email.\n\nConoco also is the largest claimant in a high-profile case in the U.S. federal court of Delaware.\n\nIn that case, 18 companies which were defaulted or whose assets were expropriated in Venezuela are seeking to cash up to $21.3 billion from an auction of shares in the parent of Venezuela-owned refiner Citgo Petroleum, the country's crown jewel.\n\nThe auction is set to restart bidding this year, after a $7.3 billion conditional offer selected by a court officer overseeing the sale process was rejected by most creditors, including Conoco.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reuters - Reporting by Marianna Parraga, additional reporting by Julia Symmes-Cobb, Editing by Franklin Paul and Jan Harvey)",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) administered the arbitration, and the committee\u2019s 356-page decision on Wednesday comprehensively dismissed Venezuela\u2019s challenges.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Challenges Rejected\n\nThe arbitration dispute stems from Venezuela\u2019s 2007 nationalization of ConocoPhillips\u2019 interests in two extra-heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt and an offshore project. Venezuela argued that:\n\nThe tribunal was improperly constituted.\n\nArbitrators exceeded their powers or failed to adequately explain their reasoning.\n\nThe damages calculation was flawed.\n\nThe annulment committee dismissed these arguments, stating the tribunal\u2019s decision was \u201ceasily understood\u201d and that Venezuela had ample opportunity to present its case. It further noted that evidence excluded by the tribunal would not have altered its damages assessment.\n\nLegal and Financial Implications\n\nThe award, initially granted in 2019, requires Venezuela to compensate ConocoPhillips subsidiaries for the unlawful expropriation of their investments.

The move, reported by Reuters, marks a significant shift in the operatorship of the Kebabangan Cluster, located in Sabah, Malaysia.\n\nPreviously, the Kebabangan Cluster was managed jointly by Petronas, ConocoPhillips, and Shell. However, with the new deal in place, ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas will operate the fields independently, a move aimed at bolstering Malaysia's energy security through to 2050. The cluster boasts an impressive export capacity, reaching up to 750 million standard cubic feet of gas daily, as confirmed by Petronas.\n\nRecent data from the IndexBox platform highlights Malaysia's oil and gas sector as a critical driver of economic growth in the region. The transfer of operations to ConocoPhillips could potentially optimize production efficiency and contribute significantly to meeting regional energy demands.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

They also supply the core ingredients of petrochemicals used to make products such as plastics, rubber, and fertilizer.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, the oil industry is highly competitive and volatile. Profits and losses can swing wildly based on small shifts in demand or moves by petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, whose interests can run counter to those of the public companies in the industry. Supply and demand imbalances can cause huge fluctuations in oil prices. We saw that in early 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent crude prices soaring into the triple digits for the first time in years. Additionally, investors must consider the implications of climate change on the long-term prospects of oil and gas. The energy sector is undergoing a massive transition to renewable energy. Even so, there are opportunities in the oil patch. Here's a closer look at some of the top oil stocks and factors to consider before buying.\n\nTop oil stocks to buy What are the top oil stocks to buy in 2025? There are dozens of oil stocks. They run the gamut from pure-play exploration and production companies (E&Ps), midstream businesses, service providers, and refiners to integrated oil majors that do a little bit of everything. Investors have lots of options. However, some oil stocks stand out as leaders in the sector.\n\nData source: Company websites. Oil stock Ticker Symbol Description ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) A global E&P company. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) A U.S.-focused E&P company. Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) A Canadian energy infrastructure giant. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) A large-scale, integrated oil supermajor. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) A leading refining company with midstream, chemical, and distribution operations.\n\n1 - 2 Here\u2019s a closer look at these top oil stocks. 1. ConocoPhillips\n\nConocoPhillips is one of the largest E&P-focused companies in the world. It specializes in finding and producing oil and natural gas. It has operations in more than a dozen countries. ConocoPhillips benefits from scale and access to some of the lowest-cost oil on earth, which includes significant exposure to the Permian Basin. It bulked up its position in that low-cost, oil-rich region in 2021 by acquiring Concho Resources and Shell's assets in the area. With average costs of about $40 per barrel and many of its resources even cheaper, it can make money in almost any oil market environment, enabling the company to generate lots of cash flow. Given the uncertainty surrounding future oil demand, ConocoPhillips plans to return a significant portion of its free cash flow to investors in the coming years. It plans to pay a steadily growing dividend, repurchase shares, and pay a variable return of cash based on its excess cash. Finally, the company complements its low-cost portfolio with a top-tier balance sheet. ConocoPhillips routinely boasts one of the highest credit ratings among E&P companies, backed by a low leverage ratio for the sector and lots of cash. These factors make it one of the safest E&P investments.\n\n2. Devon Energy\n\nDevon Energy is a U.S.-focused E&P company. It has diversified operations across several low-cost, oil-rich basins. The company's diversification enables it to produce lots of low-cost oil and natural gas, which allows it to generate plenty of cash. The company launched an industry-first, fixed-plus-variable dividend framework in 2021. It pays out as much as 50% of its excess cash flow each quarter via variable dividend payments after funding its fixed base dividend and capital expenses. Devon uses the rest of its excess cash to strengthen its balance sheet and repurchase shares. Devon's dividend strategy makes it an enticing option for income-focused investors. They can collect a steady base dividend that's sustainable throughout the oil price cycle and have the potential to earn significant payments during periods of high prices.\n\nDefinition Icon Dividends Per Share The dividends a company pays out per share and a commonly used per-share metric.\n\n3 - 5 3. Enbridge\n\nEnbridge operates one of the biggest oil pipeline systems in the world. It transports 30% of the oil produced in North America. Enbridge also has an extensive natural gas pipeline system, a natural gas utility business, and renewable energy operations. Enbridge's pipeline operations generate stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rates. That gives it the cash to pay a high-yield dividend while also investing to expand its energy infrastructure operations. Enbridge has made significant investments in recent years in infrastructure geared toward cleaner energy, including offshore wind energy in Europe and hydrogen. These investments position Enbridge for the future of energy even as it remains vital to supporting the oil market's current needs.\n\n4. ExxonMobil\n\nAs one of the largest oil companies on the planet, ExxonMobil is a fully integrated supermajor. It operates in every segment of the oil and gas industry, including E&P, midstream, petrochemical manufacturing, refining, and, even further downstream, marketing refined and petroleum products to customers. ExxonMobil has focused its recent efforts on reducing its business costs and boosting efficiency. These investments are beginning to pay off. The company has significantly lowered its oil production costs over the past couple of years by focusing on its highest-return assets while also taking steps to better leverage its massive scale, enabling it to generate lots of cash flow when oil prices are much higher. This cash flow should continue to protect ExxonMobil's dividend and its status as a Dividend Achiever. Given the growth of renewables, many investors are choosing to avoid oil stocks entirely. However, ExxonMobil is making investments in lower-carbon fuel sources, including carbon capture and storage, as well as biofuels, which may enable it to continue supplying the economy with fuel for years to come. In 2023, Exxon acquired Pioneer Natural Resources. The deal solidified Exxon's standing as one of the lowest-cost producers for the next decade to come. 5. Phillips 66\n\nPhillips 66 is one of the leading oil refining companies, with operations in the U.S. and Europe. It also has investments in midstream operations and in petrochemicals via its CPChem joint venture with Chevron (CVX 0.62%). Its marketing and specialties business distributes refined products and manufactures specialty products such as lubricants. Thanks to its large-scale, vertically integrated operations, Phillips 66 is among the lowest-cost refiners in the industry. This is the result of it leveraging its integrated midstream network to obtain the lowest-cost crude for refining and petrochemical feedstocks, as well as its investments in projects that give it higher margins on its products. Phillips 66 also boasts a strong financial profile, which includes an investment-grade balance sheet with very manageable debt. It also has lots of cash on hand. Its low debt and high cash reserves mean it has ample capital to invest in expansion projects, including renewable fuels. The company has been a dividend growth superstar and a share buyback dynamo over the past decade. The company's focus on making smart investments and returning cash to investors should enable Phillips 66 to continue enhancing shareholder value in the coming years.\n\nAnalysis How to analyze oil stocks The oil industry is inherently risky for investors. Although each segment of the industry has a specific set of risk factors, the overall oil business is both cyclical and volatile. Oil demand generally tracks economic growth. A robust economy can support rising oil prices and oil producer profitability. However, geopolitics and capital allocation also play crucial roles in the industry. The world's largest oil-exporting nations include members of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), a cartel that works to coordinate members' oil policies. OPEC's actions can significantly affect the price of oil. It can withhold supply to push prices higher or increase its output to drive them lower. OPEC has wielded its power over the years, causing massive fluctuations in oil prices. Meanwhile, oil companies that operate independently of OPEC can also have an impact on oil prices. If they allocate too much capital to new projects, they can cause an oversupply and weigh on prices. If they hold back too much, they can cause prices to surge. Since oil and gas assets are developed over a long time, companies cannot quickly increase their supplies in response to favorable market conditions. Given the volatility of oil prices, an oil company must have three crucial characteristics to survive the industry's inevitable downturns: A strong financial profile with an investment-grade bond rating, significant amounts of cash on hand or ample access to affordable credit, and manageable, well-structured debt maturities.\n\nwith an investment-grade bond rating, significant amounts of cash on hand or ample access to affordable credit, and manageable, well-structured debt maturities. Low costs of operations or relatively stable cash flow streams. E&P companies need to be able to profitably sustain operations at oil prices of less than $40 a barrel, while midstream companies should get more than 85% of their cash flow from steady revenue sources such as fee-based contracts. Downstream companies should have operating costs below the industry average.\n\nor relatively stable cash flow streams. E&P companies need to be able to profitably sustain operations at oil prices of less than $40 a barrel, while midstream companies should get more than 85% of their cash flow from steady revenue sources such as fee-based contracts. Downstream companies should have operating costs below the industry average. Diversification. Oil companies should operate in more than one geographical region or be at least partially vertically integrated by engaging in several different activities. Related investing topics\n\nRisk management Risk management is the key to investing in the oil patch The oil market can be quite fragile, with even a slight imbalance between supply and demand often causing it to go haywire. That was abundantly evident in early 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic sent the sector into a tailspin. However, the opposite is also true: Oil prices can skyrocket when demand improves amid a supply crunch. That was the case in early 2022 when crude prices surged as the economy started recovering from the pandemic and supplies were under pressure following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Because of this dynamic, investors need to be careful when choosing oil stocks. They should focus on companies that can survive rough patches since they'll be better positioned to thrive when markets turn healthy again.\n\nFAQ\n\nOil stocks FAQ What is the best oil stock to buy? angle-down angle-up There's never any one best stock for all investors, but there are superb operators in the oil sector that match up well to a variety of risk and reward preferences.

For those looking for exposure to a basket of oil stocks, there is a wide range of oil exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Is it good to invest in oil stocks? angle-down angle-up The world is slowly moving away from fossil fuels in favor of green alternatives, but that transition will take decades. For the foreseeable future, oil stocks remain an attractive way to invest in the overall health of the global economy because so much of what we do -- from transportation to industry to petrochemicals -- relies on oil. Why have oil stocks fallen? angle-down angle-up Oil has been volatile for the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic caused global oil demand to crash while oil producers slashed their output to ride out the downturn. However, as travel and commerce recovered, the demand for oil products rebounded faster than production could respond. Investors today continue to weigh strong economic activity, which has defied the threat of a Federal Reserve-induced slowdown to fight inflation. What stocks are the most sensitive to oil prices? angle-down angle-up A wide range of industries, from airlines to plastics, rely on oil, and they tend to do better when oil prices are low. Among oil companies, those that are focused primarily on the exploration and extraction of oil from the ground tend to react the most when oil prices spike or crash. Those that have more integrated businesses, adding elements like selling refined products to consumers or transporting oil over great distances, have a more constant revenue stream, regardless of the price of oil. What is the forecast for oil stocks? angle-down angle-up The price of oil fluctuates based on supply and demand, and short-term prices can be hard to predict. However, over the long term, the need for energy resources is growing, and oil is expected to fulfill a big part of that need. Assuming oil demand increases over time, the companies that do a good job producing oil should benefit.",

Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.65 billion, showing a 4.27% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for ConocoPhillips. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.3b US$10.1b US$9.74b US$10.9b US$11.3b US$11.6b US$11.9b US$12.2b US$12.5b US$12.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 2.74% Est @ 2.71% Est @ 2.68% Est @ 2.66% Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$9.6k US$8.7k US$7.9k US$8.2k US$7.9k US$7.6k US$7.3k US$7.0k US$6.7k US$6.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$13b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$284b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$284b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$141b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$218b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$106, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ConocoPhillips as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.128. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for ConocoPhillips\n\nStrength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Significant insider buying over the past 3 months. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

            "content": "January 21, 2025\n\nM.K. French\n\nFarmer Staff Writer\n\nSeems like there\u2019s been a stork convention in Watford City! Last year, a whopping 99 babies were born at McKenzie Health, a jump from 66 the year before. And a big part of this baby boom and improved women\u2019s health services is thanks to a generous helping hand from ConocoPhillips. Lynn Welker-Fevold, President of the Benefit Fund of McKenzie Health, provided details on this growth and how ConocoPhillips\u2019 generosity has helped meet women\u2019s healthcare needs in a recent press release to The Farmer.\n\nBack in 2024, ConocoPhillips donated $50,000 to the Benefit Fund of McKenzie Health to purchase a state-of-the-art ultrasound machine. This isn\u2019t just any old ultrasound; it\u2019s a real game-changer. As Dr. Carol Uhlman, OBGYN at McKenzie Health Center, explains, this machine is used to \u201cconfirm pregnancy, determine sex of the baby, and will ultimately reduce the number of trips to the Radiology Department for women.\u201d This means less running around for expecting moms and quicker access to important information for the OBGYN team \u2013 Dr. Uhlman, Dr. Andrea DiMichele, Dr. Teinesha Irvey, and Dr. Jenna Sloan.\n\nWelker-Fevold expressed deep gratitude for ConocoPhillips\u2019 ongoing support. \u201cConocoPhillips has consistently supported McKenzie Health over the years,\u201d she said, mentioning past contributions ranging \u201cfrom newborn hearing equipment to a sleeping space for providers when faced with inclement weather to construction of our greenhouse at the Good Shepherd Home. Their continued commitment to local healthcare is deeply appreciated!\u201d\n\nDr. Uhlman echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the impact of the new equipment. \u201cHaving a sophisticated ultrasound at the bedside relieves and expedites making a diagnosis as well as a treatment plan,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing is more satisfying than seeing a new mom view her baby.\u201d The new machine has also allowed the clinic to expand its services. \u201cIt has also allowed us to add gynecological procedures previously not available in the area,\u201d Dr. Uhlman explained. She also pointed out that having such high-quality equipment helps attract top-notch doctors to the rural area. \u201cOften doctors are reluctant to come to remote areas,\u201d she noted. \u201cHaving this level of ultrasound available reveals the dedication of local donors to allow us to provide exemplary services. ConocoPhillips, you have made all the difference! Thank you for supporting our team in our efforts to improve women\u2019s healthcare!\u201d\n\nRachel Logan, Stakeholder Relations Director for ConocoPhillips, explained their commitment to the community. \u201cAt ConocoPhillips, we\u2019re dedicated to building relationships with organizations that serve the communities where we live and operate,\u201d Logan said. \u201cMcKenzie Health directly addresses the vital needs of our community, and we are very proud to support them.\u201d\n\nPete Edis, CEO of McKenzie Health, highlighted the impact of the labor and delivery services, launched in January 2023. \u201cSince launching our labor and delivery services\u2026we have proudly welcomed approximately 170 newborns into our care,\u201d Edis stated. He also emphasized the importance of local access to care, noting that without these services, \u201clocal families would face the challenge of traveling 1-3 hours for obstetric care, just as they did for the previous 30 years.\u201d He concluded, \u201cBy providing accessible, high-quality care close to home, we are not only supporting our current residents but also making our area more attractive to those looking to relocate, which is vital for stabilizing the local workforce. Thank you once again to ConocoPhillips for helping McKenzie Health make a meaningful impact on the lives of those we serve.\u201d\n\nThe Benefit Fund of McKenzie Health expressed gratitude for the donation, which helps them provide more complete healthcare for women right here in Watford City.

In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

            "content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - President Donald Trump has pledged to make it easier to develop energy projects, particularly in Alaska.\n\nHis executive order \u2014 Unleashing Alaska\u2019s Extraordinary Resource Potential \u2014 undoes many of the protections put in place by the Biden administration and orders agency heads to rescind, revoke or revise policies or regulations that hinder development and production of the natural resources located on both federal and state lands in Alaska.\n\nThe order includes the prioritization of the development of a liquid natural gas pipeline and the removal of Biden-era bans on oil and gas exploration on the coastal plain of ANWR, as well as millions of acres of federal land.\n\nThe order rescinds the rejection of a right-of-way permit to build a road through wilderness in the Ambler mining district and looks to repeal the Roadless Rule that limits logging in the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska.\n\nTrump\u2019s move to unlock energy resources in the state is getting praise from all three members of Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation and scorn from many conservation groups who are vowing to fight it.\n\n\u201cTrump just can\u2019t wave a magic wand and make these things happen,\u201d according to Cooper Freeman, Alaska Director for the Center for Biological Diversity, which is based in Homer.\n\nCooper said conservation groups are banding together to challenge the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe have decades of experience fighting these sort of assaults, and whether through environmental review processes or court challenges, we are going to be working really hard to make sure these wild ecosystems remain healthy and thriving,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Alaskan Sen. Dan Sullivan called President Trump\u2019s actions a good day for Alaska, noting it was the only executive order the president issued Monday that focused on a single state.\n\n\u201cHaving the federal government as a partner and an opportunity, not an obstacle, not declaring a war on Alaska \u2014 which Biden did \u2014 is a really big thing and good thing starting out with the new administration,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThat thought was echoed by Kara Moriarty, the president of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, who said Trump\u2019s actions add clarity for oil and gas developers, especially in the National Petroleum Reserve.\n\n\u201cHe has been very clear that he wants America to be energy dominant,\u201d Moriarty said. \u201cWe heard that in the confirmation hearings last week of his Secretary of Energy and Interior nominees, and we stand ready to responsibly develop our resources.\u201d\n\nAlaskan oil and gas analyst Larry Persily was hesitant to declare the president\u2019s policies a big win for the state.\n\n\u201cAlaskans should not expect another boom out of this for oil and gas,\u201d Persily said.\n\nPersily said easing regulatory requirements will certainly make development easier in Alaska, but there are still many barriers that could deter oil companies from investing, including huge costs and the many years it can take to bring projects online and into production.\n\n\u201cThey are going to say, \u2018What\u2019s the best prospect?' A little less regulatory risk in Alaska now, but is that enough to overcome the cost and other problems of developing in Alaska? On a large scale, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Persily said.\n\nA spokesperson for ConocoPhillips, Alaska\u2019s largest energy producer, didn\u2019t specifically say if the executive order would spur new development from the company. A statement sent in part read:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Unleashing Alaska\u2019s Extraordinary Resource Potential' executive order includes important steps to restoring a balanced approach to energy production in Alaska including from the NPR-A, which Congress set aside for energy development. ConocoPhillips looks forward to continuing to responsibly explore and develop the NPR-A in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error? Report it to web@ktuu.com\n\nCopyright 2025 KTUU.

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

(Jan. 20) \u2013 After posting a pair of double-doubles in big home victories, Alaska Anchorage seniorwas named Monday as the Great Northwest Athletic Conference Player of the Week for women's basketball.A 6-3 center, Hollingshead averaged 17.0 points on 62 percent shooting, 11.0 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks as UAA defeated Simon Fraser and Western Washington at the Alaska Airlines Center.On Thursday, the Orem, Utah, native had 21 points (9-15 FG, 3-4 FT), 10 rebounds and four steals as the Seawolves outlasted the Red Leafs 78-63. Two nights later she tallied 13 points \u2013 including three baskets in the final 3:31 \u2013 and had 12 rebounds, two assists and three blocks in a 67-59 win over the Vikings. The former Umpqua (Ore.) Community College standout also helped UAA to rebounding advantages of 43-33 over SFU and 43-21 over WWU.\"Tori stepped up big time for us this past week as we dealt with an injury that required her to play a lot more minutes,\" said UAA coach. \"We have seen Tori take over in games before, but what impressed me most was her focus and improvement on the defensive end. She can switch out onto guards and bother them with her length, and she is a very good rim protector. She brought her best on both ends of the floor and played some of her best basketball last week.\"It is the third GNAC weekly honor this season for the Seawolves, along withawards in early November and early December.Riding a six-game winning streak and leading the GNAC by two games, the Seawolves (16-2, 7-0 GNAC) return to the road for games this week at Seattle Pacific (Thur., 6:30 pm AST) and nationally ranked Montana State Billings (Sat., 2:15 pm AST).

I trade this stock regularly, which is notable for being a pure play in the prolific Permian Basin.\n\nFANG shares many similarities with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which I have recently covered, and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), among others. After completing my analysis of FANG, I plan to examine EOG Resources and a few other oil companies with strong ties to the Permian Basin.\n\nDue to their significant success and substantial ownership of Permian production, the trioFANG, OXY, and EOGis one of the most powerful domestic players in the Permian Basin. They stand alongside super-major oil companies like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which, by the way, recently acquired Pioneer Resources, becoming the number one US producer by far.\n\nWhile several other companies could be considered, including Apache Corporation (APA), which had approximately 328,000 Boepd in the Permian in 3Q24, Devon Energy (DVN), which had 488,000 Boepd in the Permian in 3Q24, Civitas Resources (CIVI), which had 189,000 Boepd in the Permian in 3Q24, and Permian Resources (PR) with 151,000 Boepd in the Permian in 3Q24, these companies seem slightly less relevant in this context.\n\nThe oil equivalent production (US production only) in 3Q24 for the nine major US producers is shown below:\n\nDiamondback Energy: A Powerful Permian Player\n\nWe can see that the trio FANG, OXY, and EOG produced 2,794K Boepd in 3Q24, mostly from the Permian Basin. By the way, OXY produced 729K Boepd in the Permian Basin during the 3Q24.\n\n2: The Permian Basin: A prolific oil producer.\n\nThe Permian's contribution to US crude oil production is significant. In 2024, it was estimated to be 6.3 million barrels per day, accounting for 51.4% of the total output, estimated at 13.249 million barrels per day in 2024.\n\nThe Permian Basin spans New Mexico and Texas. While analysts anticipate a peak in oil production soon, the EIA predicts an increase of 4.8% yearly, equating to 6.6 million barrels per day by 2025.\n\nDiamondback Energy: A Powerful Permian Player\n\nSource: permianpartnership.org\n\nAs we enter 2025, it's an ideal time to assess this volatile sector and its potential by examining three reliable companies that provide low but secure dividends. Over the past year, FANG has outperformed both EOG and OXY, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nDiamondback Energy: A Powerful Permian Player\n\n3: Diamondback Energy: A Focused Investment in the Permian Basin.\n\n3.1: Oil Equivalent Production.\n\nDiamondback recorded a big jump in production this quarter after Endeavor's merger.",

Mack made it five Seawolves in double figures with 12 points (2-5 3FG), and senior forwardhad five points, five rebounds, three assists and a key late steal, doing most of her damage in the final 10 minutes.The Seawolves conclude the first round of GNAC play next week with a pair of road games, starting Saturday (6:30 pm AST) at Seattle Pacific.

In recent weeks, Biden also has designated new national monuments and ruled out the sale of drilling rights in more than 625 million acres of US coastal waters.\n\nIn the latest action, the Interior Department is proposing new \u201cspecial area\u201d designations that would restrict drilling and other activities across more than 3 million acres of the Indiana-sized reserve in northwest Alaska. The move comes on top of on an existing policy, finalized last year, that barred drilling across nearly half of the NPR-A.\n\nThe rugged terrain once earmarked for energy development contains an estimated 8.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil, but it\u2019s also an important habitat for caribou, grizzly bears and migratory birds. And it\u2019s a prized resource for Alaska Natives who have long relied on the land for subsistence hunting and fishing.\n\nThe Interior Department immediately imposed measures meant to avoid damage to those areas even while they\u2019re being considered for protection, effectively raising hurdles for building roads and other infrastructure across the tracts.\n\nAlthough Trump could cast aside his predecessor\u2019s proposed special areas and ignore the interim safeguards imposed in the meantime, the action could be challenged in federal court. The report and memo unveiled Thursday bolsters the government record for those safeguards, providing potential fodder for any future legal battle.\n\nEnvironmentalists said they hoped the effort would create a bulwark against Trump\u2019s plan to unleash American oil development.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration clearly understands that the oil and gas industry is not entitled to these precious public lands and is taking steps to ensure they survive,\u201d said Bobby McEnaney, director for land conservation at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe move could have implications for companies that have had holdings or interests in the reserve, including ConocoPhillips, Santos Ltd., Repsol SA and Armstrong Oil & Gas Inc.\n\nAlthough the Interior Department\u2019s actions do not affect valid, existing rights within the NPR-A, the recommended special areas overlap with current leases, including some held by ConocoPhillips and Oil Search Ltd., which was acquired by Santos in 2021. And they encroach on territory around ConocoPhillips\u2019 600-million-barrel Willow oil development.\n\nThe targeted areas effectively \u201cform a donut of protections around the Willow project,\u201d said Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Lands Protection Program.\n\nThe initiative was blasted by oil advocates, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, who said on X the Biden administration had \u201cwillfully ignored federal law to try to convert the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska into de facto federal wilderness.\u201d\n\nConocoPhillips Alaska decried what it called an \u201c11th-hour effort to impose interim measures by the outgoing administration.\u201d They\u2019re based on an \u201cunlawful\u201d regulation that\u2019s already being challenged in federal court, is depriving local stakeholders influence over the NPR-A and \u201cshould immediately be rescinded,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Interior Department received tens of thousands of comments after asking the public to nominate parcels for protection last year.\n\nThe 23-million-acre site was first set aside for oil supply needs roughly a century ago. When Congress authorized its commercial development in 1976, lawmakers said the government should ensure \u201cmaximum protection\u201d for some areas of it.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) has grown into one of the world's largest oil and gas producers over the years. The oil company's public history dates back to 1998, when the Continental Oil Company separated from DuPont. It was the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history at the time, at nearly $4.4 billion.\n\nHere's a look back at how many shares of the oil stock you'd own today if you bought one at its historic IPO nearly three decades ago for roughly $23.\n\nConocoPhillips has undergone a lot of changes over the past few decades. A big one came in 2001 when Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum to create ConocoPhillips, the sixth largest oil company in the world at the time.\n\nAs the company grew, so did its share price. That led the oil giant to enact a 2-for-1 stock split in June 2005. In other words, investors who bought one share at the company's IPO would have owned two shares following that split.\n\nThat is the only stock split that ConocoPhillips has completed during its history. However, the energy company also completed a stock spinoff in May 2012. It separated its downstream business (e.g., refining, chemicals, and midstream assets) by creating Phillips 66 (PSX -1.19%), which it spun off to shareholders. They received one share of Phillips 66 for every two shares of ConocoPhillips they owned at the time. As a result, an investor who bought one share of Conoco at its IPO would now own two shares of ConocoPhillips and one share of Phillips 66, which has yet to split its stock.\n\nThe value of that initial share would have grown to over $325 -- two shares of ConocoPhillips valued at $105 plus one share of Phillips 66 at $117. On top of that, investors would have collected many dividend payments from the two companies over the years. The payout would currently come to $10.52 per share annually from that initial share.\n\nAs these numbers show, even a small investment can grow significantly over the long term.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips is a US-based muti-national energy company. ConocoPhillips is a diversified and integrated energy company with operations in all energy industry segments. In 2021, it was ranked the 8th largest petroleum company by market cap and was #156 on the Forbes Fortune 500 list. Regarding the global economy, it is the world\u2019s 574th largest business, with operations in 13 countries. It is one of 5 remaining companies from Standard Oil\u2019s split up and is the result of decades of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe company\u2019s earliest origins are in 1875 with the birth of Continental Oil and Transportation Company, Conoco. The company grew quickly with the industrial revolution and the widening usage of Kerosene, among other petroleum products, for heating and lighting. By 1885 it had become part of the Standard Oil family of companies, a time in which it also saw explosive growth.\n\nAssets related to the original Conoco were sold to oil exploration leader E.W. Marland and were later remerged following Standard\u2019s demise. By 1929, the company was an independent and fully integrated energy company specializing in crude and derivative products. Phillips Petroleum Company was founded in 1917 as an oil exploration company that quickly expanded into diversified operations. The company hit the big times upon the discovery of natural gas in the Texas panhandle and it saw explosive growth in the war and post-war periods of the early and mid-20th century.\n\nToday, ConocoPhillips explores for, develops and produces crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and bitumen across a diversified portfolio of assets. The company also transports and markets crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids and their derivative products through a global network of distributors.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations span the conventional and tight oil markets, including shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands and other petroleum-related businesses. As of late 2022, the company had more than 6.1 billion barrels of proven oil and oil-equivalent reserves and was producing 1.731 million barrels of crude and equivalents per day. Roughly 50% of operations are centered in the crude oil market while less than 40% are natural gas, with the remainder made up of LNG and bitumen (asphalt).\n\nThe company's portfolio includes conventional, unconventional plays in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Assets are primarily located in Alaska (about 33% of US production), Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and the Anadarko Basin. Revenue topped $45.8 billion in 2021 and the company employs about 9,900 worldwide. Exploratory operations are underway in Columbia and Chile where the opportunity for both scale and flexibility is present.\n\nConocoPhillips was the first major oil company to adopt the Paris Climate Accord and pledge to achieve net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050. Areas of focus include increasing operational efficiencies, supporting the reduction of end-use pollutants and advancing low-carbon alternatives, including hydrogen production and fuel cells.",

Trump returns to the White House on Monday, and he has pledged to grant fossil fuel companies broad access to American land and federal waters. The new protections, which take effect immediately, create a legal hurdle that could slow down, though probably not stop, efforts by the Trump administration to expand drilling in part of the North Slope known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.\n\nThe reserve is the largest expanse of undisturbed land in the United States. It is an important nesting ground for migratory birds, home to caribou, grizzly bears and wolverines and is an important habitat for polar bears. It also contains large reserves of oil and gas and was created in 1923 as a source of oil for the Navy. Some exploratory drilling took place over the decades but it was largely left untouched until the late 1990s.\n\nLaura Daniel-Davis, the acting deputy secretary of the Interior Department, said that, under the new policy, the Bureau of Land Management would have to explain how drilling in the protected areas would affect subsistence hunting and fishing in the vast wilderness.",

He added that many executive orders will instruct federal agencies to restore America's focus on \"energy dominance.\"\n\nOther targets include Biden-era regulations that encourage the shift to electric vehicles, including curbs on tailpipe pollution and a federal waiver allowing California to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Trump may also toss out Biden's executive order from 2021 directing federal agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across their buildings, vehicles, and supply chains.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and \"unleash Americans' energy production,\" even with the US already producing a record amount of oil and gas and being the world's largest exporter. Industry executives, employees, and corporate political action committees donated more than $32 million to Trump's campaign, data tracked by Open Secrets shows.\n\nBut many of the industry's priorities can't be accomplished with an executive order alone, either because Congress has to change laws or federal agencies have to undertake lengthy rulemaking processes. Attempts to roll back Biden's climate rules will likely be challenged in court, as well.\n\n\"When he takes office, President Trump will make America energy dominant again, protect our energy jobs, and bring down the cost of living for working families,\" Karoline Leavitt, spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said.\n\nHere's what fossil fuel groups said could happen quickly in the new administration.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGreenlighting new gas terminals\n\nTrump can direct the Energy Department to start approving new permits for LNG terminals immediately via executive order, said Kenny Stein, vice president for policy at the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group advising Trump's energy agenda.\n\nThe move would end a temporary pause the Biden administration instituted in January 2024 so the Energy Department could study the impacts of more LNG exports on the economy, national security, and the climate crisis.\n\nThe API argued that the pause threatens global energy security and US competitiveness overseas and will cost jobs at home. In December, the Energy Department found that the US is already on track to double LNG exports to 2028 under approved projects, and continuing to approve new projects will increase greenhouse gas emissions fueling the climate crisis.\n\nEnvironmental groups are expected to challenge new LNG permits in court and could cite the Energy Department's study.\n\nOil and gas leases on federal land and water\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to unwind limits that the Biden administration's Interior Department placed on oil and gas drilling in areas like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.\n\nTrump is expected to direct the Interior Department to revise a five-year offshore leasing plan finalized by the Biden administration. The plan scheduled three auctions between 2024 and 2029 \u2014 a record low compared to the 47 sales proposed during Trump's first term.\n\nIn Alaska, the president-elect also wants to further open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve to fossil fuel development.\n\nBiden in 2023 approved ConocoPhillips' massive Willow oil drilling project in the National Petroleum Reserve, but then made tens of millions of acres of the reserve off-limits to drilling to protect wildlife habitat.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Congress also directed the Interior Department to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling for the first time. The Biden administration auctioned off 400,000 acres in January, the smallest amount allowed under the law, but it didn't attract a bidder. An auction in the final weeks of the Trump administration also didn't attract interest from any oil majors.\n\nThe state of Alaska sued the Biden administration over the sale, arguing that the area's size and additional restrictions made oil drilling economically unviable. The Trump administration could potentially expand the sale.\n\nTargeting EVs\n\nTrump is also expected to direct the EPA and Transportation Department to start reviewing and rewriting regulations that encourage the shift to electric vehicles.\n\n\"I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,\" Trump said during a speech at the Republican National Convention in July. \"Thereby saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving US customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car.\"\n\nThere are no federal EV mandates, however. In March, the EPA finalized tailpipe pollution limits for cars, SUVs, and trucks sold between 2027 and 2032, which are the strictest to date. The Biden administration said this could boost electric vehicles to up to 56% of new car sales, while hybrids could account for about 13% of sales as automakers adjust production to meet the new standards.\n\nTrump is likely to go after California's recent move to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Under the Clean Air Act, the state can set more stringent limits on tailpipe pollution than the federal government as long as it's granted a waiver from the EPA. The agency in December greenlighted California's plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, which the Trump administration is expected to revoke \u2014 similar to a fight with California over the waiver in his first term.\n\nThat would likely set up a legal fight with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has moved to \"Trump-proof\" the state and vowed to defend the state's EV and climate policies.",

I don't know what it is with electric, this guy loves electric,\" Trump said last week during his Mar-a-Lago press conference.\n\n\"We're going to be ending the electric car mandate,\" he added as he bounced from criticizing Biden's support for green energy to extolling the virtues of gas heaters and showers without water flow restrictors.\n\nThe following day, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's nominee for secretary of the Department of Interior, said he will also head up a new National Energy Council, which \"which will consist of all Departments and Agencies involved in the permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation, transportation, of ALL forms of American Energy.\"\n\nENERGY HAS BECOME \u2018MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT NEEDS TO BE,\u2019 SAYS FORMER TRUMP ENERGY HEAD\n\nIn reaction to the selections last November, American Conservation Coalition (ACC) President Christopher Barnard said the combination of Burgum and Wright \"is literally the dream team.\"\n\nTrump made energy independence and bolstering oil and gas production a cornerstone of his campaign. While on the campaign trail, he pledged to expand fracking and lift a pause on liquefied natural gas exports, a sharp contrast from the Biden administration.\n\nTESLA STOCK JUMPS ON REPORT TRUMP PLANS TO EASE REGULATIONS AROUND SELF-DRIVING CARS\n\nThe president-elect has also vowed to use his second White House term to exit the Paris climate accord again, undo strict emissions standards for vehicles and power plants, and bolster production of U.S. oil and gas, including through fracking.\n\nThose planks on his energy platform appear to align well with the priorities of the American Petroleum Institute (API), which released a policy roadmap in an open letter to the incoming president and Congress last year, listing top priorities to address in 2025 and beyond aimed at securing American energy leadership.\n\nAPI President and CEO Mike Sommers told FOX Business in November there are specific actions the administration can take to right the ship in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nMUSK PEGS POTENTIAL TRUMP TREASURY SECRETARY PICK BESSENT AS \u2018BUSINESS-AS-USUAL CHOICE,\u2019 BACKING LUTNICK\n\n\"As governor of a top production state, Doug Burgum has demonstrated a keen understanding of the importance of harnessing America\u2019s energy advantage,\" Sommers said. \"We look forward to working with him once confirmed to implement a pro-American approach to federal energy leasing, starting with developing a new five-year offshore leasing program and removing barriers to onshore leasing to fully leverage our nation\u2019s natural resources.\"\n\nSommers said API also looks forward to working with Wright once he is confirmed \"to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE\u2019s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world.\"\n\nAPI\u2019s five-point policy plan outlines the industry's priorities for the administration and the Republican-controlled House and Senate, including:\n\nProtecting consumer choice\n\nRepeal the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) tailpipe rules\n\nRepeal the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards\n\nDeny/rescind EPA\u2019s Waiver for California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars II rule\n\nHOW TRUMP'S RETURN TO WHITE HOUSE COULD IMPACT AUTO INDUSTRY\n\nBolstering America\u2019s geopolitical strength\n\nLift the Department of Energy's (DOE) LNG permitting pause\n\nSwiftly process all pending export applications now languishing at DOE\n\nEnsure the open access of American energy to global markets\n\nLeveraging our natural resources\n\nIssue a new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management five-year offshore leasing program\n\nRepeal restrictive onshore leasing rules, starting with the Bureau of Land Management Conservation and Landscape Health Rule\n\nEnd EPA\u2019s methane fee that misinterprets congressional intent and does little beyond increasing the cost of production for American oil and natural gas\n\nReforming our permitting system\n\nReform the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA)\n\nReform the Clean Water Act\n\nAdvance judicial reform\n\nRepeal the Biden-era NEPA rules\n\nAdvancing sensible tax policy\n\nRetain the 21% corporate tax rate to ensure global competitiveness\n\nMaintain and extend tax provisions for domestic infrastructure investment\n\nPreserve crucial international tax provisions\n\nBillionaire energy executive Harold Hamm, Continental Resources founder and chair, told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo that Biden has always been anti-energy.\n\n\"To tell the truth, he's had a war against oil and gas for all of his existence. In the Senate and right through his presidency, so that's who he is. So, thank God we have leadership coming in that knows how to accelerate, expedite exploration in this country,\" Hamm said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX News' Chris Pandolfo, Emma Colton and Andrea Margolis contributed to this report.\n\n* This article, originally published on 11/19/24, has been updated.",

Increasing adoption of LPG as a domestic fuel in emerging economies of Asia-Pacific, such as India and China, where it is one of the largest imported commodities, and the means of government subsidies will remain a key driving factor for the growing demand for butane.\n\nAccording to the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), the global import of butanes was 41.52 million metric tons in 2023. The top importers of liquefied butanes were India, China, Indonesia, the European Union, and Morocco.\n\nIn Egypt, the government supplied around 3.6 million tons of butane gas, and Petrogas filled 310 million cylinders through 49 filling stations in fiscal year (FY) 2023/24. The government company Petrogas has 3,067 distribution centers.\n\nIncreasing demand from the construction industry\n\n\n\nThe construction and building industry worldwide is showing a significant pace of growth and development. One of the primary reasons for this industry's expansion is the growing global urbanization. This includes constructing parks, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, houses, buildings, etc., for a large urban population.\n\n\n\nA construction site has several uses for energy, including cutting, welding, roofing, and drying. To carry out the tasks, reliable fuel is essential. This can be a mixture of hydrocarbons such as propane and butane, LPG, a popular fuel.\n\n\n\nBesides the increase in the construction industry, according to Eurostat, in the European Union, building construction increased by 1.1% compared from 2022 to 2023, and civil engineering increased by 4.1%. Countries with significant increases are Romania, Poland, and Belgium, which are the top countries showing considerable growth in the region. This increase in the construction industry indicates an overall increase in raw materials for inputs, including the butane market.\n\n\n\nButane market geographical outlook\n\n\n\nBy geography, the butane market is segmented into North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The major economies like China, Japan, India, and South Korea dominate the Asia-Pacific region. Some of the fastest-growing emerging economies are from this region, such as ASEAN countries.\n\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to see notable growth in the butane market due to its increasing demand for household consumption.\n\n\n\nIn India, LPG refers to both liquefied propane and butane or mixtures. The number of LPG connections has grown significantly, from 14.52 crore in 2014 to over 32.73 crore as of August 1, 2024, including 10.33 crore PMUY connections. This increasing demand for household consumption will increase the need for butane in the country.\n\n\n\nNorth America is expected to have a significant market share for butane products. The major applications of butane are in different industries, especially in the United States, such as aerosols, foam extrusion, packaging, cabinet heaters, etc.\n\n\n\nReport Coverage:",

            "content": "The Norwegian Ministry of Energy has offered 53 new production licenses on the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\nAwards in Predefined Areas (APA) is an annual exploration round for the Norwegian continental shelf. Of the 53 production licenses offered in APA 2024, 33 are located in the North Sea, 19 in the Norwegian Sea, and one in the Barents Sea.\n\nIn total, 20 oil companies were offered parts in one or more of these licenses. The companies (parts/operatorships) are: A/S Norske Shell (1/1), Aker BP (19/16), Concedo (3/0), ConocoPhillips Skandinavia (3/3), DNO Norge (13/4), Equinor Energy (27/7), Harbour Energy Norge (4/3), INPEX Idemitsu Norge (8/2), Lime Petroleum (1/0), M Vest Energy (2/0), OKEA (8/2), OMV (Norge) (4/3), Orlen Upstream Norway (8/0), Pandion Energy Norge (3/0), Petrolia NOCO (5/3), Source Energy (1/0), Sval Energi (7/2), TotalEnergies EP Norge (2/0), V\u00e5r Energi (16/5) and Wellesley Petroleum (3/2).\n\nEquinor\u2019s 27 new production licenses include 20 licenses in the North Sea, six in the Norwegian Sea and one in the Barents Sea.\n\n\"There are still substantial resources on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Together with our partners, we need to explore more to contribute to European energy security and maintain our position as a reliable supplier of oil and gas. The annual award of pre-defined areas is crucial to ensure high export levels over time. We will continue to make robust investments, and our ambition is to drill around 250 exploration wells by 2035. In order to do this, we need regular access to acreage,\" says Jez Averty, Equinor's senior vice president for subsurface, the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\nEquinor operates 35 offshore platforms that together make up an extensive network of amortized production, processing and export infrastructure.\n\n\"We have a significant portfolio of smaller discoveries near existing infrastructure. We're working alongside the supplier industry to accelerate developments and reduce costs, which will ensure that several of these discoveries can come on stream even earlier. One good example is Eirin, which will be tied back to Gina Krog. This development was approved in January 2024, and we expect production to start in the end of 2025. The gas from Eirin will have very low production emissions, since the Gina Krog platform is electrified. Moreover, it will extend Gina Krog's lifetime by seven years,\" Averty continues.\n\nFor discoveries that require new development solutions, Equinor will prioritize solutions that yield low emissions.\n\nAker BP was offered licenses in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. West of Yggdrasil, Aker BP was offered operatorship on the former Frigg field, where the partnership plans to drill an exploration well already in Q2 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the award that was announced today. It reflects a comprehensive application and gives us a foundation for maintaining our growth ambition on the Norwegian continental shelf and our ambitious exploration strategy. Phasing in oil and gas from new discoveries will be crucial to ensuring long-term activity on the shelf,\u201d says Per \u00d8yvind Seljebotn, SVP Exploration and Reservoir Development in Aker BP.\n\n\u201cAlthough the shelf is maturing, we manage to continuously identify new opportunities. Leveraging new technology, digitalization and investments in new data are crucial for creating good exploration opportunities for many years to come and ensuring growth and innovation in our sector. Our strategy is to have a portfolio of exploration licenses that provides a good balance between exploration wells near existing fields and infrastructure, and wells that, if successful, can form the basis for standalone developments.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The Supreme Court dealt a major setback to the oil industry Monday, refusing to block lawsuits from California and other blue states that seek billions of dollars in damages for the effects of climate change.\n\nWithout a comment or dissent, the justices turned down closely watched appeals from Sunoco, Shell and other energy producers.\n\nIn Sunoco vs. Honolulu, the oil industry urged the justices to intervene in these state cases and rule that because climate change is a global phenomenon, it is a matter for federal law only, not one suited to state-by-state claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d they told the court.\n\nBut none of the justices said they wanted to hear their claim, at least not now.\n\nThe decision clears the way for more than two dozen suits filed by states and municipalities to move forward and try to prove their claim that the major oil producers knew of the potential damage of burning fossil fuels but chose to conceal it.\n\n\u201cBig Oil companies keep fighting a losing battle to avoid standing trial for their climate lies,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity. \u201cWith this latest denial, the fossil fuel industry\u2019s worst nightmare \u2014 having to face the overwhelming evidence of their decades of calculated climate deception \u2014 is closer than ever to becoming a reality.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court against five of the largest oil and gas companies \u2014 Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and BP \u2014 and the American Petroleum Institute for what they described as a \u201cdecades-long campaign of deception\u201d that created climate-related harms in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor more than 50 years, Big Oil has been lying to us \u2014 covering up the fact that they\u2019ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet,\u201d Newsom said in announcing the suit.\n\nIn recent days, California officials have blamed climate change for the devastating weather conditions that contributed to the deadly wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes and other structures, leading to what many experts expect to become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s suit followed the pattern set by similar claims from the cities of Baltimore, New York, Chicago and San Francisco as well as blue states including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Minnesota.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese suits argue that the oil producers used deceptive marketing to hide the danger of burning fossil fuels. Under state law, companies can be held liable for failing to warn consumers of a known danger.\n\nIn June 2024, the court asked the Justice Department to weigh in on the issue. In December, lawyers for the Biden administration urged the court to stand aside for now because the suits are at an early stage.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he took no part in the decision to deny the appeals, presumably because he owns stock in companies affected by the dispute.\n\nThe climate change lawsuits were patterned after the successful mass lawsuits filed by states and others against the tobacco industry over cigarettes and the pharmaceutical industry over opioids.\n\nCigarettes and opioids were sold legally, but the suits alleged that industry officials conspired to deceive the public and hide the true dangers of their highly profitable products.\n\nUnder state law, plaintiffs can seek damages for broad and open-ended claims such as a failure to warn of a danger, false advertising or creating a public nuisance. All three claims are cited in California\u2019s lawsuit. Federal law, by contrast, is usually limited to damage claims that are authorized by Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHad the Supreme Court agreed to hear the oil industry\u2019s appeal in the Hawaii case, it \u201cwould have frozen the cases for a year or more and could have resulted in a death blow for all of them,\u201d said Patrick Parenteau, an environmental law expert at the Vermont Law School.\n\nLos Angeles lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents Chevron, said the company \u201cwill continue to defend against meritless state law climate litigation, which clashes with basic constitutional principles, undermines sound energy policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Alabama and 20 red states urged the court to throw out these blue-state lawsuits. They said liberal states and their judges should not have the power to set the nation\u2019s policy on the energy industry. The court has not ruled on that claim yet.\n\nThe case dismissed Monday began five years ago when the city and county of Honolulu sued Sunoco and 14 other major oil and gas producers, alleging a failure to warn and creating a nuisance.\n\nThe Hawaii Supreme Court last year rejected the industry\u2019s motion and refused to dismiss the suit.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the plaintiffs say the issue is whether defendants misled the public about fossil fuels\u2019 dangers and environmental impact. We agree .... This suit does not seek to regulate emissions and does not seek damages for interstate emissions,\u201d the state court said in a unanimous opinion. \u201cRather, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint clearly seeks to challenge the promotion and sale of fossil-fuel products without warning and abetted by a sophisticated disinformation campaign.\u201d",

            "content": "By Glenn R. Legge, Endeavor Management\n\nOver the last 50 years, the offshore energy sector has overcome numerous engineering and financial hurdles to push energy production into greater water depths and address significant challenges.\n\nFrequently, these advances were achieved through cooperative strategies involving industry groups, often referred to as joint industry projects (JIPs) or joint industry task forces (JITFs).\n\nThese JIPs have dealt with a wide range of technical challenges, ranging from addressing challenges posed by deepwater gas hydrates (2014 NETL JIP) to the use of floating facilities to allow production in deeper water and harsher subsea conditions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant and/or notable JIP studies and recommendations were the result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) tragedy. The American Petroleum Institute (API) created four JITFs to study operating procedures, subsea well control, and oil spill preparedness. These JITFs issued a series of reports following their analyses of the DWH event, including:\n\nOil Spill Preparedness and Response Report on Industry Recommendations (2011)\n\nReport on Industry Recommendations to Improve Subsea Well Control and Containment (2012)\n\nIndustry Recommendations to Improve Offshore Operating Procedures and Equipment (2012).\n\nSimilarly, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) formed the Global Industry Response Group (GIRG), a JIP that studied the lessons learned from DWH and issued a series of industry recommendations to prevent similar disasters.\n\nPerhaps one of the most impactful and unprecedented JIP was the 2010 creation of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), a collaboration between ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, ConocoPhillips. The goal of this JIP was to develop a deepwater containment and diversion system following the DWH event. The creation of MWCC played a key role in enabling the offshore industry to overcome the deepwater drilling moratorium in an effective and environmentally responsible fashion.\n\nThe offshore energy industry\u2019s use of JIP structures has established an admirable record of conducting E&P operations more efficiently, effectively and safely using combined industry research, resources and technology. The use of JIPs and similar joint industry activities is now benefitting the evolution of energy transition in the US Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and other offshore areas around the world.",

            "content": "The S&P 500 is just a few percentage points off a record high, sports a relatively expensive valuation, and is coming off back-to-back years of massive gains. But many energy stocks have inexpensive valuations and high yields, making them good buys for value and passive-income investors.\n\nConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%), Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.07%), and Phillips 66 (PSX -1.19%) all have compelling valuations and yield over 3%. Investing $1,000 in each stock should generate about $112 in passive income in 2025 based on the yield of each stock at the time of this writing. Here's why all three dividend stocks are great buys now.\n\nThe upstream play\n\nConocoPhillips is the largest U.S.-based independent exploration and production company by market cap. The company's production has dramatically increased in recent years due to organic investments and two blockbuster acquisitions -- Concho Resources and Marathon Oil. ConocoPhillips completed its acquisition of Concho in January 2021, and Marathon Oil was completed on Nov. 22, 2024. So 2025 will be the first full year of results post-Marathon acquisition.\n\nConocoPhillips has a sizable and highly efficient production portfolio that allows it to break even even at relatively low oil and gas prices. Like it did with Concho, ConocoPhillips expects synergies with Marathon to further reduce its production costs. Even including its dividend expense, ConocoPhillips expects to achieve breakeven free cash flow (FCF) at low $40s per barrel of oil equivalent (boe). Without including the dividend, the FCF breakeven is in the low $30s per boe.\n\nConocoPhillips already has a solid yield of 3.1%. But investors can expect even more passive income going forward, as ConocoPhillips expects its dividend growth rate to be in the top 25% of S&P 500 companies.\n\nOil prices had a mediocre year in 2023. But even in that operating environment, ConocoPhillips continued to rake in the earnings and FCF. The stock sports a price-to-earnings ratio of just 12.1 and a price-to-FCF ratio of 12.9 -- making it a great value for folks who believe oil prices will stay around these levels or even lower.\n\nBy investing $1,000 in ConocoPhillips, you can expect to earn about $31 in passive income in 2025.\n\nThe midstream play\n\nKinder Morgan stock surged over 50% in 2024 -- massively outperforming the major indexes and the broader energy sector. The breakout can be attributed to years of underperformance, growing earnings, and a change in sentiment toward the company's long-term growth projects.\n\nKinder Morgan operates in the midstream part of the oil and gas value chain. Its energy infrastructure assets, from pipelines to storage to terminals and more, connect areas of hydrocarbon production to areas of processing, distribution, and consumption.\n\nKinder Morgan has to see greater demand for oil and gas production to justify building more infrastructure. Concerns regarding the role of oil and gas in a cleaner energy future led investors to question the value of Kinder Morgan's infrastructure and its ability to put capital to work in profitable projects to justify paying a high dividend. But sentiment seems to have shifted.\n\nOil and natural gas could play a key role in the energy mix for decades to come, especially if the total amount of energy consumed is expected to accelerate due to economic growth and demand from artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Kinder Morgan has some massive projects coming online over the next few years. It sees an opportunity for even more infrastructure investments due to rising industrial gas demand, onshore liquefied natural gas exports to Mexico, and demand from AI data centers.\n\nKinder Morgan was beaten down for so long that it's still cheap, even after its run-up. It sports a P/E ratio of 24.4, a forward P/E of 22, and a price-to-FCF ratio of 15.7.\n\nWith a yield of 4.1%, investors can expect a $1,000 investment in Kinder Morgan to earn about $41 this year.\n\nThe downstream play\n\nPhillips 66 operates in the downstream part of oil and gas, and also has a midstream segment. Refining involves taking crude oil and other feedstocks and turning them into gasoline, petroleum products, aviation fuel, and more. Phillips 66 can't control the price of oil or what buyers will pay for these products, but it can make its operations as efficient as possible to maximize how long its plants are up and running and the margins it makes on refined products. It can also manage costs and the timing of its long-term investments.\n\nStill, Phillips 66's efforts to manage costs have been far outweighed by the industry downturn. As you can see in the chart, its operating margin peaked in early 2023, followed by a rip-roaring year of rising stock prices that peaked in early 2024, and then had a brutal sell-off as margins and earnings continued to fall.\n\nPhillips 66 and peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum have seen margins and earnings plummet. Outside of refining, there's a downturn across the materials sector, expanding into commodity and specialty chemical companies, petrochemical companies, and more.\n\nDespite the lower earnings, Phillips 66 is still an incredibly profitable company. Its dividend sits at $4.60 per share, while trailing-12-month earnings are $7.83 per share. Consensus analyst estimates call for $9.33 in 2025 earnings per share, roughly double the dividend. So Phillips 66's dividend, with its 4% yield, is affordable.\n\nLike ConocoPhillips and Kinder Morgan, Phillips 66 isn't an expensive stock. It has a P/E of 14.8, a forward P/E of 12.4, and a price-to-FCF of 16.9.\n\nA $1,000 investment in Phillips 66 will earn you $40 in passive income in 2025.",

BHS was able to pull it out after only scoring 11 points in the first half, including just three in the second quarter.\n\nBruin head coach Tommy DeSalme says he is happy for his guys.\n\nThe Bruin guy's game is unfortunately called off for Friday, as Millwood decided not to travel.\n\nFULL COP ARVEST DAY 2 ACTION NEWS",

Stronger-than-expected employment growth and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% raised fears the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting interest rates for most of 2025.\n\nDecember Jobs Report Fuels Fed Hawkishness: Dollar Soars, Yields Jump\n\nThe U.S. economy added 256,000 new jobs last month, marking an acceleration from the downwardly revised 212,000 jobs added in November and sharply outpacing economist forecasts of 160,000, as tracked by TradingEconomics.\n\nThe December reading represented the strongest monthly job growth since March 2024, underscoring the continued resilience of the U.S. economy despite high interest rates and resurgent inflationary pressures.\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked down from 4.2%to 4.1% in November, defying expectations of no change. Wages rose broadly in line with expectations, with average hourly earnings increasing 0.3% month-over-month, slowing slightly from November\u2019s 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, wages climbed 3.9%, marginally below the 4% forecast.\n\nFed fund futures showed a steep decline in the probability of a March rate cut, with implied odds dropping to just 26%, down from 43% a day earlier, according to CME\u2018s FedWatch tool.\n\nTreasury yields rose sharply across the curve, reflecting a repricing of interest rate expectations.\n\nThe two-year yield, closely tied to Federal Reserve policy expectations, jumped 11 basis points to 4.37%. The 10-year yield surged 10 basis points to 4.79%, its highest level since November 2023.\n\nNotably, the most striking move came in the 30-year yield, which breached the 5% mark for the first time since October 2023. Before that, the last time 30-year yields surpassed this milestone was in August 2007. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT dropped 1.2% in premarket trading, highlighting the market's sensitivity to long-term rates.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index, tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF UUP, surged 0.5% to 109.70, a level last seen in late October 2022.\n\nThe greenback climbed 0.4% against the Japanese yen and 0.6% versus the euro, pushing the euro-dollar pair to a fresh 27-month low of 1.0250. The Sterling wasn\u2019t spared, falling 0.7% to a 15-month low against the dollar.\n\nStocks Slump Across The Board\n\nFutures on major U.S. indices were down 1% across the board, as the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates rattled investors. All S&P 500 sectors, except energy, traded in the negative premarket Friday.\n\nReal estate, tracked by the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund XLRE, and technology, represented by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, both sank 1.4%.\n\nRate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and growth-heavy tech bore the brunt of the selloff as higher yields weighed on long-duration assets.\n\nThe one standout sector was energy, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE climbing 1.3%.\n\nMajor Premarket Movers\n\nAmong energy giants, Chevron Corp. CVX gained 1.67% to $152.81, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM rose 1.57% to $108.61 and ConocoPhillips COP advanced 1.43% to $103.07, benefiting from a 3% spike in oil prices after Reuters reported thet U.S. is mulling stronger sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil sector.\n\nIn contrast, rate-sensitive mega-cap tech stocks dragged the market lower.\n\nNvidia Corp. NVDA fell 2.51% to $136.59, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD dropped 2.92% to $118.28 and American International Group Inc. AIG plunged 3.93% to $68.63, leading losses among financials.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock.",

As of Jan. 9, 2025, the company had a market capitalization of more than $469 billion with more than 14 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nIt is a major integrated energy company with many energy commodity interests, including electrical power generating operations. At the core of its business is the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and natural gas. In 2023, ExxonMobil earned $36 billion and had net oil-equivalent production of 3.7 million barrels per day. XOM had a dividend yield of 3.70% as of Jan. 9, 2025.\n\nThis is a look at some of Exxon Mobile's top competitors, which include Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell.\n\nKey Takeaways ExxonMobil is the largest and most profitable oil and gas company in the U.S. with domestic and global rivals.\n\nChevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company.\n\nConocoPhillips is a U.S.-based energy exploration and production company.\n\nPreviously known as Royal Dutch Shell, Shell PLC is a London-based energy company that also invests in alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\nChevron Corporation\n\nOriginally headquartered in San Ramon, California, Chevron (CVX) announced a move to Houston, Texas in August 2024. Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company, with a market capitalization of about $267.9 billion and an average daily trading volume of more than seven million shares as of Jan. 9, 2025. The company has integrated petroleum, chemicals, mining, and power generation operations.\n\nChevron had total earnings of $21.3 billion in 2023, and its annual per-share dividend payout has consistently risen each year. The company's average oil-equivalent production was 3.1 million barrels per day. CVX returned $26.3 billion to shareholders in 2023 in the form of $11.3 billion in dividends and $14.9 billion in share repurchases.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) is a Houston-based company that positioned itself as an exploration and production company within the oil and gas industry. The company engages in the worldwide exploration, production, transportation, and marketing of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and liquefied natural gas.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, 2025, the company's market capitalization was $131.45 billion, and its average daily trading volume was 6.57 million shares. At that time, COP paid a dividend yield of 3.07%.\n\nConocoPhillips earned a total of $11 billion in 2023, and it produced over 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company also had another 6.8 billion barrels of reserves for the year.\n\nShell PLC\n\nOriginally from the Netherlands and known as Royal Dutch Shell, this company is now based in London and simply goes by Shell (SHEL). The company had a market capitalization of more than $198.7 billion as of Jan. 9, 2025, with more than 4.2 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nShell had net earnings of $28 billion in 2023 and ended the year with reserves of nine billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nShell also invests in alternative energy sources. The company has interests in numerous wind energy projects in North America, Europe, and Asia, including multiple in its original home of the Netherlands. It anticipates that its future growth will come from its upstream operations, where technological advances will help the company find new liquid and natural gas reserves. The company also has growth strategies in integrated gas and underwater drilling.\n\nIs ExxonMobil a Downstream or Upstream Company? ExxonMobil is considered an integrated company, which means it has upstream and downstream operations. As part of its upstream operations, the company explores, extracts, and ships raw materials. The majority of its profits are derived from its upstream operations. XOM's downstream operations involve the manufacturing and distribution of crude oil products.\n\nWhat Does Downstream Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry? The term downstream refers to a side of the oil and gas industry that involves converting oil and gas into finished products. Downstream operations results in the production of natural gas, gasoline, and other types of energy sources. Energy companies that are exclusively involved in downstream activities are directly linked to end users. Many companies, though, are involved in downstream, midstream (refining), and upstream (exploration and extraction).\n\nWho Are ExxonMobil's Largest Institutional Shareholders? The largest institutional shareholders of ExxonMobil are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street. They held 432.11 million (9.83% of outstanding shares), 306.81 million (6.98% of outstanding shares), and 221.68 million (5.04% of outstanding shares), respectively. These figures are as of Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nExxonMobil is a U.S.-based crude oil and natural gas company with operations around the world. Since it has upstream and downstream operations, it explores, produces, transports, manufactures, and sells crude oil and gas products. Although XOM competes with rivals Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell domestically and abroad, it retains the top spot in the United States.",

Total employment in the sector is expected to average 8,700 jobs a month.\n\nStill, that is below the 9,900 average monthly oil and gas jobs in 2019 and well below peak employment in that sector in 2014, which averaged over 14,000 jobs.\n\nWiebold said Alaska oil and gas employment and the industry\u2019s situation in general have been volatile in recent years, with the pandemic playing a role. The decline after 2014 signaled the start of an Alaska recession, though oil and gas jobs started to rebound in 2019. \u201cAnd then 2020 changed the demand so much for oil that everything just kind of turned a little bit on its head,\u201d she said.\n\nPossibly affecting employment now is the mature state of many fields, which may not need as many people to operate as they did in the past, she said.\n\nThe seafood industry, which dominates Alaska\u2019s manufacturing sector, is forecast to be the biggest job loser this year.\n\nThe Icicle Seafoods plant is Seward is seen from a harbor dock on June 22, 2024. Icicle Seafoods and Ocean Beauty Seafoods merged in 2020. Turmoil in the seafood industry has led to job losses in the processing sector. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)\n\nStatewide, the manufacturing sector is expected to have 5% fewer jobs in 2025 than in 2024, according to the forecast. That would follow a 6.3% decline in 2024 from the year prior, according to the department.\n\nSeafood processing, like the seafood industry as a whole, is facing difficult straits, with plant closures or operation reductions, low prices and, in some cases, dwindling fish runs. Those problems are not expected to be alleviated in the immediate future, according to the forecast.\n\nOther constraints on Alaska\u2019s employment and economic picture could come from federal budget cuts, the forecast said.\n\nWiebold said budget cuts should not affect federally funded infrastructure projects \u2013 for now. Money from the infrastructure bill has already been allocated, she noted.\n\nHowever, that infrastructure funding is not unlimited, and there will be a sunset eventually, she said. \u201cThis is a discrete period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nFederal budget cuts could hurt Alaska employment in other ways, she said. Officials with the incoming Trump administration have expressed plans for big cuts in the federal workforce. That affects Alaska, where federal government jobs are important in the economy, she said.\n\n\u201cIt might take a little bit, but there are going to be downward pressures on federal employment in Alaska,\u201d she said.\n\nDan Robinson, chief of the department\u2019s research and analysis section, cited the fundamental challenge that threatens economic growth in Alaska: shifting demographics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some economic trends that are creating job growth. But unfortunately, too, we\u2019ve got this long-term issue,\u201d he said.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, Alaska lost 34,000 residents in their prime working ages, 18 to 64, Wiebold\u2019s article noted.\n\nThat is a cloud hanging over the state\u2019s economic future, the expected 2025 growth notwithstanding, Robinson said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe would have more growth available to us if the workforce issue weren\u2019t the constraint that it is,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for the losses.\n\nPassengers walk between a cruise ship and downtown Juneau\u2019s dock on April 26, 2024. The 2024 Alaska cruise season set a new record, and revised figures put the total number of passengers at about 1.8 million. Another big cruise season, with more Southeast Alaska tourism jobs, is expected this year. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)\n\nThe state just completed its 12th straight year of net outmigration \u2013 with more people moving out of the state than moving in, by far the longest such streak on record. Several factors are combining to make the state less attractive to potential newcomers, Robinson said.\n\n\u201cNobody should forget that there\u2019s something that\u2019s off a bit in the desirability of people to make Alaska their home,\u201d he said.\n\nAlaska\u2019s population is also aging rapidly. Though Alaska\u2019s population is younger than those of most states, it is aging the fastest, by some measures. The per-capita senior population grew faster in Alaska than in any other state, and the number of Alaskans 60 and older increased by two thirds from 2010 to 2022, according to state officials\u2019 analysis.\n\nBirth rates have slowed over recent years, meaning fewer young Alaskans growing into ages when they can hold jobs, the forecast noted.\n\nThe Alaska Economic Trends January issue also describes how employment patterns are expected to vary by region in the coming year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnchorage, for example, is not expected to gain any oil and gas jobs, even though employment in that sector is forecast to increase significantly.\n\n\u201cWe see these being oil field jobs, not headquarters, which is more of how you think about Anchorage,\u201d Wiebold said. Additionally, the role of the state\u2019s biggest city as an oil and gas headquarters has changed in recent years, she said. One big factor was Hilcorp\u2019s acquisition of BP assets, which ultimately shrank the city\u2019s oil industry workforce, she said.\n\nIn the Fairbanks North Star Borough, the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector is expected to have the biggest percentage increase in jobs, at 8.3%, according to an article in the magazine focused on that community. Fairbanks is a regional hub, and Amazon has opened a facility there, notes the article, also written by Wiebold.\n\nIn Southeast Alaska, tourism is the bright spot for expected job growth, according to an article focused on that region and written by Robinson. Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector is expected to grow by 6.5% in 2025, and the 300 jobs in that sector represent half of the expected 600 new jobs in the region this year.\n\nAlaska had a record cruise ship year in 2024, with the number of visitors now estimated at about 1.8 million, according to industry data used for the forecast. Near-record cruise visits are expected this year, according to the forecast.\n\nThe 1.8 million figure is higher than totals reported previously. The revision comes from information from the industry about more passengers being carried aboard each ship, with higher occupancy rates in berths, Wiebold and Robinson said.\n\nConstruction employment is expected to grow in Southeast Alaska, according to the forecast. But the impact has been a bit muted compared to the rest of the state.\n\nRobinson said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has had less effect up to now on Southeast Alaska than on other parts of the state, for reasons yet to be understood. And much of the construction growth expected in the near future is related to North Slope oil development, which has some effect on Anchorage and Fairbanks businesses and jobs but does not really touch the Southeast part of the state, he said.",

            "content": "\u201cMost businesses, when you have an increase in costs, you can increase your revenue to offset that,\u201d said Mark Kalegha, an energy finance analyst with IEEFA, in an interview with Canada\u2019s National Observer. \u201cBut if your revenue can't move, and you can't control your costs, the picture becomes clear that this is not a good investment.\u201d\n\nIn a study published Thursday, the international Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found the $16.5-billion project to pipe carbon dioxide captured from 13 oilsands sites in northern Alberta to an underground storage site south of Cold Lake, using 600 kilometres pipelines, is facing spiralling cost challenges with limited revenue. Together, the factors are conspiring to threaten the project\u2019s profitability \u2014 and therefore, its ability to go ahead.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance\u2019s proposed carbon capture and storage megaproject has not begun construction or even received approval, and yet its business model is already collapsing, according to a global think tank.\n\n\u201cIf operating costs rise at currently observed industry rates for the life of the [Pathways] project, then total cost per tonne of CO2 at the proposed facility would balloon to levels that make breakeven or profitability highly improbable,\u201d the study found.\n\nAccording to IEEFA, the Pathways Alliance, whose members include Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial Oil, MEG Energy and ConocoPhillips Canada, which collectively represent 95 per cent of oilsands production, is facing increasing operating costs, the same problem experienced with other carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Since 2016, Shell\u2019s Quest project has seen operating costs grow 118 per cent. Similarly, Wolf Midstream\u2019s Alberta Carbon Trunk Link has had costs balloon more than 60 per cent since 2020.\n\nThe business model of a carbon sequestration project is essentially this: companies capture and store carbon dioxide, earn credits for doing so, sell the credits to others, and generate revenue. The revenue is used to recoup construction costs, pay for the energy used to capture and transport carbon dioxide, monitor the storage site and more. Whatever is left over is profit.\n\nA CCS project can only be profitable if it can earn credits for less than the price on carbon, and then pocket the difference. But in Canada, there is effectively a ceiling of $170 per tonne on how much a carbon credit could be sold for. That\u2019s because the federal carbon price is scheduled to rise to $170 per tonne in 2030, and paying the carbon price is a company\u2019s alternative to reducing emissions.\n\nThe Pathways Alliance\u2019s proposed carbon capture and storage megaproject has not begun construction or even received approval, and yet its business model is already collapsing, according to a global think tank.\n\nThink of it this way: with a carbon price in place, a company has two options. It either cuts its emissions to lower its costs or it pays the carbon price. Buying carbon credits is one way a company could reduce its emissions. So a company would only be interested in purchasing carbon credits if they cost less than the carbon price, because if they cost more it would make better financial sense to just pay the price on carbon.\n\nThat means a carbon capture business, like any business, is incentivized to push its costs down as much as possible. If a company could capture a tonne of CO2 for $50, it could sell for $100 on the market and would likely find buyers because that\u2019s cheaper than paying the full $170 carbon price.\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s competition on the way, further undermining the Pathways business case. Alberta has shortlisted several facilities to capture up to 56 million tonnes of CO2 by decade\u2019s end. That means up to 56 million carbon credits could flood the market and push cost per credit down even farther.\n\nIf Pierre Poilievre\u2019s Conservatives form government and scrap the carbon price as promised, the Pathways Alliance project would be even less likely to be built because the carbon price is the backbone to a carbon market. Without an incentive to reduce emissions, there\u2019s little reason to build a business model around selling carbon credits.\n\n\u201cIf there's a penalty for pollution\u2026, you have to purchase these credits in order to compensate for your pollution,\u201d said Kalegha. \u201cIf you don't have to buy carbon credits in the market, then what then is the value? There's no revenue for these CCS projects.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Pathways staring at the writing on the wall. Last year, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, whose company boasts of capturing 40 per cent of all anthropogenic CO2 ever captured, told investors on a shareholder call it\u2019s a steep challenge to reduce costs, and there is still no workable business model for the industry.\n\nAn unprofitable carbon capture project will not provide lasting benefit for communities because they will be unable to create sustainable job opportunities or lasting infrastructure development. Rather, communities could end up saddled with environmental risks with no long-term benefit, IEEFA warns.\n\nThe project \u201cis probably going to lose money without subsidies,\u201d Kalegha said. \u201cThat's the only way this becomes viable is if there are external subsidies to plug in this gap.\u201d\n\nThe Pathways Alliance claims the project is critical to their ability to cut emissions and has aggressively lobbied for government subsidies to help build it.\n\nThe federal government is offering a 50 per cent tax credit the Pathways Alliance members could use to slash approximately $5.7 billion from the project\u2019s total cost, while Alberta\u2019s carbon capture incentive program offers grants expected to cost Albertans between $3.2 billion and $5.3 billion.\n\nBut according to an alliance official, the federal government is still not offering enough. At a senate committee meeting in May, Mark Cameron, Pathways Alliance vice-president and former senior advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said the group is looking to recover at least two-thirds of its costs.\n\nOffering to cover 50 per cent of carbon capture costs \u201cdoesn\u2019t stack up to what the U.S., the U.K., and Norway have,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIn those jurisdictions, there are more generous financial incentives for carbon capture.\u201d\n\nKalegha said the fact the Pathways Alliance members, who are already cash rich, are reluctant to invest their own money in the project is evidence they're aware this is not a viable business model. Subsidies would be required to bridge the revenue shortfall, he said.\n\n\u201cTaking a cue from the TMX [Trans Mountain pipeline expansion] debacle, care must be taken that subsidies \u2026 do not become open-ended commitments that effectively hook taxpayers into footing the bill for massive cost overruns,\u201d the study found. \u201cIf anyone, the primary emitters should bear the financial burden and take the risk for pollution prevention and remediation initiatives.\u201d\n\nCarbon capture projects come with significant risks to the environment and climate too. According to the IEEFA analysis, industry claims it can capture 95 per cent or more of its carbon dioxide, but projects have failed to achieve those targets in practice.\n\nOn top of that, carbon capture can only address some of the emissions from extracting, transporting and refining fossil fuels, but is irrelevant to the majority of emissions from oil and gas that occur when the fuel is burned, like in the engine of a car. That means global emissions can still increase even with a successful carbon capture industry.\n\nAs previously reported by Canada\u2019s National Observer, the Alberta Energy Regulator will not subject the Pathways project to an environmental assessment, as requested by the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and a coalition of environmental organizations.\n\nDenying a full assessment is concerning to environmental advocates, Indigenous leaders, and health experts because when CO2 pipelines fail, they can fail catastrophically.\n\nIn recent years, the most alarming example of a CO2 pipeline failure occurred in 2020 when a rupture happened in the small town of Satartia, Miss., causing a mass poisoning that hospitalized about 50 people. When the pipeline burst, a massive cloud of concentrated carbon dioxide exploded into the air, but because CO2 is heavier than air, it didn\u2019t dissipate. Instead, it settled into a thick fog rolling through the community, displacing oxygen and dropping people to the ground as they struggled to breathe.\n\nJohn Woodside / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada\u2019s National Observer",

            "content": "Crude oil prices were relatively quiet last year. Brent oil, the global benchmark price, slipped 3%, closing the year at around $77 a barrel. Meanwhile, WTI, the U.S. oil price benchmark, ended the year right where it began at roughly $71 per barrel. Record production in the U.S. and weakness in China's economy kept the market balanced, keeping a lid on crude prices.\n\nMost analysts expect more of the same in 2025, with the consensus that crude prices will remain in the $70s this year. Because of that, oil stocks can't rely on oil prices to pump up their share prices this year. They'll need other catalysts.\n\nTwo oil stocks with notable catalysts are ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%) and Chevron (CVX 0.62%). That's one of the many reasons they've risen to the top of my buy list this year.\n\nAn acquisition-fueled boost\n\nConocoPhillips made a big splash last year. It acquired rival Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion all-stock deal (which includes the assumption of $5.4 billion of debt) that closed in late November. The highly accretive transaction further deepened its portfolio in the lower 48 states, adding over 2 billion barrels of resources at an average cost of supply below $30 per barrel (WTI).\n\nThe company initially expected to capture over $500 million in cost and capital synergies within the first year of closing the deal. It now anticipates that number will be over $1 billion within the first 12 months. That will help boost its free cash flow even more.\n\nConocoPhillips plans to return a meaningful percentage of its growing cash flow to shareholders. It has already boosted its dividend by 34%. The company intends to deliver dividend growth in the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%) in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, it boosted its share repurchase rate from $5 billion annually to $7 billion. That has it on track to retire all the equity issued to acquire Marathon Oil within the next two to three years. ConocoPhillips's growing cash flow and cash returns should help give it the fuel to outperform its peers this year if oil prices continue to meander along in the $70-a-barrel range.\n\nA potential massive catalyst ahead\n\nChevron has been working on closing a needle-moving deal of its own. The oil giant agreed to buy Hess in a $60 billion all-stock deal in October 2023. The transaction would significantly upgrade and diversify Chevron's already world-class portfolio. It would enhance and extend the company's production and free cash flow growth outlook into the 2030s, helping it more than double its free cash flow by 2027 (assuming $70 oil).\n\nThere's just one problem: Exxon believes the deal triggered a change of control clause relating to its joint development agreement with Hess and a third partner (China's CNOOC) in Guyana. The companies are engaged in arbitration, with a ruling expected later this year.\n\nIf Chevron wins, it will be able to close its acquisition of Hess, which would significantly enhance its already robust long-term growth profile. While the company may lose its arbitration case, there's reason to believe it will emerge victorious.\n\nIt's not solely buying Hess for its stake in Guyana. The acquisition would also bolster its U.S. onshore operations by adding the oil-rich resources of Bakken in North Dakota to its portfolio. In addition, it would add complementary positions in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. These additions would enable Chevron to upgrade its entire portfolio.\n\nThose additional benefits are why I predict Chevron will close its megadeal for Hess this year, which would provide it with a big boost in 2025 and beyond.\n\nEven if it loses, Chevron will be in a strong position. It expects to grow its free cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027 (assuming Brent averages $60 a barrel), fueled by high-return capital investments into its existing resource portfolio. That will enable Chevron to continue increasing its dividend (which it has done every year for over three decades) and repurchase shares at the top end of its $10 billion to $20 billion annual target range.\n\nThe added fuel to outperform\n\nConocoPhillips has already closed its needle-moving deal, and Chevron should be able to wrap up its transaction this year. Those acquisitions should provide these oil stocks with a big boost in 2025. That's why they stand out as the top ones to buy this year.",

Teams were given their Kickoff Kits, which included motors, batteries, control system components, construction materials and additional automation components. Afterward, students quickly got to work planning their strategies.\n\nTeams took advantage of the Quick Build sessions to start planning.\n\nThe competition begins with regional and district events leading to the final championship in mid-April. At these games, robots weighing up to 135 pounds begin autonomously placing coral on the reef and gathering additional algae and coral. Then, they will be remotely controlled on the court to move the algae from the reef to the barge or human players. In the game's final moments, the robots must return to the surface with algae by grabbing onto cages and hanging.\n\nGraphic representing what the court will look like for competition.\n\nCEAT hosts this event to increase involvement within STEM for the community\u2019s high school students and allow them a space to participate in this exciting event.

(Source: Enverus Intelligence Research)\n\nThrough August 2023, North Dakota producers have drilled and completed more than 400 horizontal wells in the middle (2nd) and lower (3rd) Three Forks intervals, producing more than 91 MMbbl of oil, 234 Bcf of natural gas and 106 MMbbl of water, according to the first study.\n\n\u201cThese wells have amounted to ~2% of the drilling activity in the Bakken-Three Forks petroleum system, and ~1.7% of the total oil production to date,\u201d authors Timothy Nesheim and Edward Starns wrote in the report.\n\nMost of those projects (360+ wells) have landed in the shallower middle Three Forks bench.\n\nOperators have only landed around 40 laterals in the deeper lower Three Forks. Just six lower Three Forks horizontals have come online since 2014\u2014and none since 2017, \u201clikely due to variable and overall low well production results,\u201d per the report.\n\nGamma-ray wireline log example of the Bakken-Three Forks section with core-plug oil and water saturation data from Enerplus Resource\u2019s Hognose 152-94-18B-19H-TF. (Source: North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources)\n\nLower Three Forks wells have produced approximately 6.7 MMbbl, 14 Bcf of gas and 11 MMbbl of water through August 2023.\n\nNesheim and Starns aimed to answer a key question in the first study: Does direct drilling and development of the middle Three Forks reservoir provide additional resource recovery? Or does middle Three Forks co-development only accelerate recovery rates of resources that would have otherwise been recovered by standalone upper Three Forks development?\n\n\u201cIf middle Three Forks co-development simply accelerates oil and gas recovery rates, but does not add any long-term resource, then upper Three Forks wells should be less productive in the middle Three Forks co-development area versus upper Three Forks well performance where the middle Three Forks was not co-developed,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe report evaluated historical and future projected oil production from 593 North Dakota horizontal wells across 51 drilling spacing units (DSUs). North Dakota DSUs are typically 1,280 acres, or 2 square miles.\n\nThe study focused on northeastern McKenzie County, North Dakota\u2014near the deepest portions of the Williston\u2014where most of the middle Three Forks development has been sited.\n\nOf the 25 DSUs evaluated that contained middle Three Forks horizontals, 17 \u201cexhibited a clear volumetric addition of oil\u201d from the reservoir, according to the study; six did not, and the contributions were unclear for two of the units.\n\nWater-cut map of middle Three Forks horizontal wells based upon productive wells drilled and completed through the end of 2019.

(Source: North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources)\n\nThose 17 DSUs with middle Three Forks development showed an approximate 1 MMbbl to 2 MMbbl uplift in EURs compared to adjacent units without middle Three Forks development.\n\nRELATED\n\nDevon Energy Completes Grayson Mill Acquisition\n\nFuture upside\n\nThe first study aimed to demonstrate the incremental productivity of co-developing the middle Three Forks alongside the middle Bakken and upper Three Forks. A second study aimed to define a contiguous area of potential new development for middle Three Forks projects.\n\nAssuming middle Three Forks wells can be drilled in each 1,280-acre DSU, researchers outlined approximately 275,000 acres in northeast McKenzie County where new horizontal wells are most viable.\n\nNot counting existing wells, 604 middle Three Forks horizontals could still be drilled with that immediate prospective area, according to the study. Ultimate EURs for the new projects could range between 165 MMbbl and 410 MMbbl of oil.\n\n\u201cThe results of these studies indicate that developing the middle Three Forks in addition to the Middle Bakken and upper Three Forks can increase long-term recovery,\u201d Nesheim and Starns wrote.\n\nLongtime North Dakota producers like Continental Resources and Petro-Hunt have explored the Three Forks\u2019 potential since the mid-2000s.\n\nWith the Bakken shale in a later stage of maturity today, some North Dakota producers are touting their future upside in the deeper Three Forks intervals.\n\nDevon Energy Corp. deepened its Williston footprint with a $5 billion acquisition of EnCap portfolio company Grayson Mill Energy last year.\n\nThe Grayson Mill acquisition deal added 500 gross undrilled locations and around 300 candidates for refrac projects. Around 80% of the new locations are in the Bakken and 20% were underwritten in the Three Forks.\n\nLast fall, private equity firm Carnelian Energy Capital made an investment in Zavanna LLC, which has around 150 drilling locations across the Bakken and Three Forks.\n\nRELATED\n\nBorn in the Bakken",

            "content": "Energy stocks delivered an underwhelming performance in 2024. For example, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund -- which holds the energy stocks listed in the S&P 500 -- delivered a meager 2% return last year, significantly underperforming the broader market index's 23% return. Oil prices, which initially rallied but ended the year right about where they started, kept a lid on oil stocks last year.\n\nWhile oil stocks performed poorly last year, they could bounce back in 2025. Devon Energy (DVN -2.76%), ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%), and Chevron (CVX 0.62%) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the smartest ones to buy in the new year. Here's why they think these oil stocks could deliver standout performances in 2025.\n\nIf oil markets rebound, so will Devon Energy\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Devon Energy): Oil and natural gas are highly volatile commodities. The recent 20% jump in natural gas in a single trading session is proof of that. For most investors, playing it safe with an integrated energy major is the best bet for 2025, or any year for that matter. But if you think energy prices will rebound in 2025, well, a company focused on producing oil and natural gas will likely be the more attractive option. Devon Energy fits that bill with a U.S.-focused portfolio of oil and natural gas assets.\n\nDevon Energy is one of the largest independent U.S. producers. Its portfolio is split roughly 50/50 between oil and natural gas (and natural gas liquids). The portfolio includes key U.S. production basins. Devon has a low break-even point of around $40 per barrel of oil. The company has roughly a decade's worth of inventory on which to drill additional wells in support of long-term growth. And it has an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. Even if energy prices fall, Devon Energy as a company is highly likely to muddle through.\n\nBut it is the upside potential that is most interesting here. That's because, as a production company, Devon is basically leveraged to rising energy prices. Plus, it just acquired production assets in the Williston Basin. That move has left the company with a leveraged balance sheet, which will be easier to address if oil prices rise. So, not only will the top and bottom lines improve if energy rallies, but so will the balance sheet. Investors will likely reward the stock very well if energy markets rebound in 2025.\n\nAn acquisition-driven boost ahead\n\nMatt DiLallo (ConocoPhillips): ConocoPhillips closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil at the end of November. The acquisition will really move the needle for ConocoPhillips. It deepened the oil company's portfolio, adding highly complementary acreage in the lower 48 states loaded with low-cost resources (2 billion barrels with an average cost of supply below $30 a barrel).\n\nThe transaction will also be immediately accretive to its earnings, cash flow, and return of capital to shareholders. ConocoPhillips expects to capture over $1 billion in cost and capital synergies in its first year of ownership (up from its initial expectations of $500 million). As a result, the deal should supply the company with a lot of free cash flow in 2025 and beyond.\n\nConocoPhillips expects to return a meaningful percentage of its excess cash to shareholders in the future. It recently boosted its dividend by 34% and intends to deliver dividend growth in the top 25% of all companies in the S&P 500 going forward.\n\nThe oil producer also recently expanded its share repurchase authorization by up to $20 billion. It expects to ramp its annual repurchase rate from $5 billion to $7 billion in 2025, putting it on track to retire all the equity it issued to acquire Marathon Oil over the next two to three years.\n\nThe increase in cash flow and capital returns to shareholders could help give ConocoPhillips the fuel to outperform its rivals in the oil patch this year. That makes it look like a smart oil stock to buy in the new year.\n\nMultiple catalysts could fuel higher returns in the future\n\nNeha Chamaria (Chevron): With shares of Chevron ending 2024 in the red, buying the oil and gas stock now should make for a smart move. Chevron is using its strong balance sheet and steady cash-flow growth to expand its portfolio and reward shareholders, which should be reflected in its stock price in the long term.\n\nFor instance, Chevron expects to spend nearly $13 billion on its upstream business this year. Aside from the Permian Basin, the company will invest in the Gulf of Mexico and DJ Basin, where it is ramping up some deepwater growth projects. For example, Chevron expects to boost production in the Gulf of Mexico by almost 50% by 2026. In between, Chevron is confident about closing its $52 billion all-stock acquisition of Hess in the near future, having received an antitrust-review clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in September last year.\n\nFor now, Chevron expects to grow its production by a compound annual growth rate of 3% and annual free cash flow (FCF) by more than 10% on average through 2027. With Hess, it expects to grow production and FCF \"faster and for longer.\"\n\nIn short, Chevron has strong growth catalysts, and as its cash flows grow, dividends should, too -- Chevron has increased its dividends for 37 consecutive years. With the stock yielding 4.4%, Chevron makes for a rock-solid oil stock to buy in 2025 and hold.",

            "content": "In 2024, the major U.S. stock indices including the Nasdaq Composite ( $NASX ), S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( $DOWI ) posted impressive double-digit gains. But not every index member was so lucky.\n\nFortunately for those hard-hit companies, analysts think some of these 2024 losers are due for a bounce of over 30% this year. These potential turnaround candidates have debt-equity ratios below 50% and consistent earnings growth with a minimum 5% annual increase over five years.\n\nExploration and production company ConocoPhillips ( COP ), biotech innovator Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ( REGN ), and steel producer Nucor Corporation ( NUE ) fit the bill. Despite double-digit declines in 2024, analysts foresee strong upside potential for the stocks.\n\nTo that end, for investors eyeing solid gains, these Wall Street-approved stocks could be the ultimate picks for the new year.\n\nS&P 500 Stock #1: ConocoPhillips\n\nHouston-based ConocoPhillips ( COP ), founded in 1875, is a global energy leader. With a $115.1 billion market cap, it focuses on extracting oil ( CLG25 ) and natural gas ( NGG25 ) from low-cost, high-quality assets worldwide.\n\nOperating across North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe, the company thrives in areas like the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford while maintaining a foothold in Canada\u2019s oil sands and global LNG projects. By prioritizing efficiency and scale, ConocoPhillips secures its position as a trusted leader in meeting global energy demands.\n\nCOP stock endured a turbulent 2024, shedding 12% over the past 52 weeks and plunging 10.7% over the past three months despite a 6.4% spike post-Q3 earnings on Oct. 31.\n\nJust last month, it scraped a 52-week low at $94.23 , seemingly stuck in the doldrums. But recent sparks suggest a turnaround, with COP jumping over 5.5% in the past five trading days as whispers of soaring natural gas demand, driven by biting winter forecasts, breathe fresh life into the stock.\n\nPriced at 5.77 times forward EV/EBITDA and 5.92 times cash flow, COP looks reasonably valued at current levels.\n\nLast month, ConocoPhillips rewarded shareholders with a $0.78 per share dividend, boasting a forward yield of 3.52%. With bold moves like its $22.5 billion Marathon Oil acquisition , COP is targeting elite status among dividend growers .\n\nBeyond payouts, the company\u2019s share buybacks are equally impressive, retiring 14% of shares since 2021. With $20 billion earmarked for repurchases, COP\u2019s strategy blends rising dividends with shrinking share counts for lasting value.\n\nConocoPhillips delivered solid third-quarter earnings results on Oct. 31, reporting $13.6 billion in revenue and generating EPS of $1.78, which surpassed bottom-line estimates by 6%.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump could spark an oil and gas resurgence and in turn could accelerate Conoco\u2019s growth, particularly with Arctic-focused initiatives like the Willow project and infrastructure investments. With strategic positioning and expanding Alaskan ambitions, ConocoPhillips is primed to capitalize on favorable policy shifts and resource development opportunities.\n\nQ4 production is forecast to be between 1.99 and 2.03 MMBOED, and full-year production is projected to be between 1.94 and 1.95 MMBOED, up from earlier guidance. Additionally, the company plans nearly $2 billion in Q4 buybacks and remains on track to return $9 billion to shareholders in 2024, including enhanced dividends.\n\nAnalysts expect the company\u2019s profit to be $7.79 per share in fiscal 2024 and then jump by 2.7% to $8 per share in fiscal 2025.\n\nConocoPhillips had a rough ride last year, ranking among the market\u2019s underperformers. But analysts see brighter days ahead. Jefferies recently crowned COP its top pick for the coming year, citing its lag behind U.S. peers and potential to benefit from pro-energy policy shifts. The brokerage firm has a \"Buy\" rating on COP, setting a target of $146 , which implies upside of 46%.\n\nAnalyst Lloyd Byrne highlighted ConocoPhillips' impressive oil-weighted asset duration and robust balance sheet, which offer both growth potential and downside protection. With a sustainable free cash flow yield and key growth projects nearing a capex roll-off in 2026, COP is poised for a strong rebound. Investors and management are expected to refocus on its undervalued potential, making the Texas-based energy giant a standout in the exploration and production industry heading into 2025.\n\nWall Street is highly bullish on COP, viewing the stock as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d Among the 27 analysts covering the stock, 22 recommend a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two advise a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and the remaining three analysts play it safe with a \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nThe mean price target of $134 suggests 34% upside potential from the current levels. The Street-high target of $165 indicates the stock could rally as much as 65%.\n\nS&P 500 Stock #2: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals\n\nNew York-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( REGN ) is a biotech pioneer turning cutting-edge science into transformative treatments. Known for its in-house innovation, Regeneron\u2019s medicines address challenges from eye diseases and cancer to rare conditions and neurological disorders.\n\nValued at a market cap of roughly $78.9 billion, the biotech powerhouse has been navigating a tough 2024 on Wall Street. Over the past 52 weeks, its stock has slipped 20% , with a sharper 27% plunge in the last three months alone. Hitting a low of $693 just last month, the stock\u2019s performance reflects recent headwinds, but for seasoned investors, such dips often signal opportunities, considering Regeneron's strong track record of innovation and a promising pipeline.\n\nREGN trades at a compelling 15.93x forward adjusted earnings , undercutting both the healthcare sector median and its own historical average .\n\nOn Oct. 31, Regeneron delivered Q3 earnings results , exceeding expectations across the board. The biotech giant raked in $3.7 billion in revenue, up nearly 11% year-over-year, showcasing solid growth. Adjusted EPS hit $12.46, an 8% increase from last year's quarter, beating estimates by a solid 6.5% margin.\n\nDespite challenges with Eylea , its top drug, facing competition from Roche\u2019s (RHHBY) Vabysmo and a legal battle with Amgen (AMGN) over patent rights, Regeneron has kept its momentum. Eylea saw a 21% dip in sales year-over-year, but it was overshadowed by strength from Eylea HD, Dupixent, and Libtayo.\n\nEylea HD, launched in August 2023, made waves with $392 million in U.S. sales during Q3, reflecting a smooth patient transition. Combined U.S. sales of Eylea and Eylea HD hit $1.5 billion, up 3% from the previous year. Regeneron\u2019s oncology therapy, Libtayo, also contributed solidly to the growth.\n\nTo reinforce shareholder value, Regeneron repurchased $738 million of its stock during the quarter, leaving $2.9 billion under its share buyback program. This strategic capital deployment positions the company well for continued growth, proving Regeneron\u2019s resilience and ability to thrive, even in a competitive landscape.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2024, Regeneron is tightening its belt. Management slightly upped R&D expenses, expecting them to fall between $5.055 billion and $5.145 billion, while net product sales are expected to maintain a strong non-GAAP gross margin of 89%. At the same time, capital expenditures were trimmed to a range of $700 million to $740 million, signaling a sharper focus on operational efficiency.\n\nMeanwhile, Wall Street analysts are forecasting steady, if modest, growth for Regeneron\u2019s bottom line. Fiscal 2024 EPS is projected to rise marginally year-over-year to $37.95, with a slight bump to $38.16 in fiscal 2025, showcasing solid and consistent performance in the years to come.\n\nDespite a double-digit pullback in shares over the past year, analysts are still backing this biotech powerhouse. Looking ahead, the company\u2019s pipeline is brimming with potential. It recently announced strong Phase 2 results for two monoclonal antibodies targeting thrombosis - essentially blood clots blocking circulation. These treatments are now moving to Phase 3 , set to kick off in early 2025, potentially paving the way for more positive news.\n\nWall Street is confident about the biotech stock, having a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Among the 26 analysts covering the stock, 18 are highly bullish with a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one advises a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d six suggest a \u201cHold,\u201d and one has a \u201cModerate Sell.\u201d\n\nThe average analyst price target of $1,084.76 indicates potential upside of 51.4% from the current price levels. However, the Street-high target of $1,300 suggests that the stock could surge as much as 81.5%.\n\nS&P 500 Stock #3: Nucor Corporation\n\nNucor Corporation ( NUE ), founded in 1905, has forged its legacy as a steel industry titan and North America's largest recycler. Headquartered in North Carolina, it produces a vast array of steel products with operating facilities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nStaying ahead, Nucor\u2019s 2024 partnership with Mercedes-Benz to supply low-carbon steel underscores its innovation and sustainability focus, paving the way for growth in the automotive sector. A pioneer in green steel, Nucor blends tradition with a future-driven vision. Its market cap currently stands at $27.1 billion.\n\nLast year has been tough on NUE, tumbling 29.3% over the past 52 weeks. Even though the stock slid 20.4% over the past three months alone, hitting its 52-week low of $112.25 on Jan. 3, yesterday\u2019s trading session brought a spark of optimism - a 4.5% surge suggesting NUE might be finding its footing.\n\nNUE stock is attractively priced at 14 times forward adjusted earnings and 0.89 times sales, offering a solid value compared to the materials sector peers, making it a standout for value-seeking investors.\n\nNucor\u2019s dividend payment record is a testament to its strength and commitment to shareholders. Since 1973, this steel giant has raised its dividend every year, earning the coveted Dividend King status. Even in the cyclical steel industry, Nucor's success stands out, reflecting its solid business model and investor dedication.\n\nOn Dec. 11, the company announced a 1.9% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share, marking its 207th consecutive quarterly payout. The company offers an annualized $2.20 per share, translating to a yield of 1.8%. Plus, with a low payout ratio of 19.68%, Nucor balances rewarding investors with maintaining its focus on growth, ensuring the next chapter in its legacy.\n\nNucor\u2019s Q3 earnings release on Oct. 21 showed resilience, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations despite some headwinds. The company posted adjusted net earnings of $353 million, or $1.49 per share , beating the consensus of $1.40 . While total net sales dropped 15.2% annually to $7.44 billion, they still exceeded projections. Nucor shipped 6.2 million tons of steel, with 19% going to internal customers.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, Nucor had $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and returned $2.29 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the first nine months of 2024. During Q3, the company repurchased about 2.5 million shares at an average price of $156.07.\n\nNucor\u2019s Q4 earnings report is set to show a dip. The company projects Q4 EPS between $0.55 and $0.65, driven mainly by weaker earnings in the steel mills and products segments. Lower volumes and average selling prices are to blame, but there is a silver lining: the raw materials segment is expected to see an uptick. While steel product earnings cool off, Nucor\u2019s raw materials division is poised to bring in a boost, signaling growth potential despite the tough quarter.\n\nAnalysts tracking the company expect its profit to be $8.28 per share in fiscal 2024 and then jump by 5.3% to $8.72 per share in fiscal 2025.\n\nGoldman Sachs sees a promising future for Nucor despite last year\u2019s dip. With trade policies potentially shifting in favor of U.S. steel under a second Trump term, Nucor is positioned for a comeback. Earlier last month, the brokerage firm initiated coverage with a \"Buy\" rating on NUE stock, highlighting Nucor\u2019s strength to capitalize on rising steel demand, especially in sectors like data centers. With a strategic focus and strong industry positioning, Nucor is set to turn the page on its recent decline and reignite growth this year.\n\nNUE stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Among the 13 analysts covering the stock, seven are highly bullish with a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one advises a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and five suggest a \u201cHold.\u201d",

(Source: Rextag)\n\nOf the approximately 2,000 additional drilling locations added through the Marathon transaction, roughly half are in the Eagle Ford.\n\nCrescent Energy also continued to roll up acreage across the Eagle Ford in 2024, closing a $2.1 billion acquisition of SilverBow Resources and a $905 million acquisition of Ridgemar Energy.\n\nIn the Austin Chalk play, Magnolia Oil & Gas continues to add leasehold to its position in the Giddings Field.\n\nRefrac attack\n\nAs one of the first shale plays to be developed horizontally, the Eagle Ford has relatively little white space left. Most of the highest quality drilling inventory is already owned in the portfolios of a handful of large producers.\n\nWith new drilling locations scarce, operators are increasingly evaluating recompletion projects to breathe new life into older horizontals.\n\nA growing number of Eagle Ford producers are leaning into refracs, re-entries, recompletions and other redo jobs\u2014using modern drilling techniques to extend production from declining wells.\n\nEagle Ford operators touting refrac projects include ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, BPX Energy, Crescent Energy, Baytex Energy and Verdun Oil.\n\nRefracs are a hot topic today, but they\u2019re old news for Verdun, a private E&P backed by EnCap Investments. The company started developing a refrac strategy around 2018, when Verdun completed what it says was the first full linear isolation refrac performed in the Eagle Ford trend.\n\nThe wells Verdun identifies for refracs generally have average lateral lengths of around 6,000 ft and were completed before 2016.\n\nLNG Future\n\nCertain operators see future opportunity stemming from the natural gas windows in the far western Eagle Ford.\n\nEOG Resources is developing the Dorado gas play in the southwestern area of the play near the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nLast year, EOG brought online the 100-mile Verde Pipeline, a 1 Bcf/d project transporting Dorado gas to the Agua Dulce sales hub near Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nEOG is running a single rig on its Dorado gas play, but the company anticipates growing activity in South Texas as demand for LNG, and gas prices, increase in the future.\n\n\u201cAs the market starts to open up for us, we\u2019d like to increase that,\u201d EOG CEO Ezra Yacob said during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call.\n\nA handful of large-scale LNG export facilities are under construction near the Agua Dulce Hub, including Rio Grande LNG and Corpus Christi LNG State III. Several more are under construction along the U.S. Gulf Coast, including Golden Pass LNG and Port Arthur LNG.\n\nLNG export capacity from the U.S. is expected to grow by nearly 10 Bcf/d through 2027, according to EIA data, as new liquefaction projects tick online, including Plaquemines LNG, which started production in December.\n\nGas production from the Eagle Ford will grow from 6.7 Bcf/d to 7 Bcf/d this year, the EIA forecasts.",

            "content": "ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.8%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ConocoPhillips is:\n\n20% = US$9.9b \u00f7 US$50b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nConocoPhillips' Earnings Growth And 20% ROE\n\nTo start with, ConocoPhillips' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for ConocoPhillips' significant 27% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nWe then compared ConocoPhillips' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 40% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is COP fairly valued? This has everything you need to know.\n\nIs ConocoPhillips Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nConocoPhillips has a three-year median payout ratio of 42% (where it is retaining 58% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that ConocoPhillips is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.\n\nAdditionally, ConocoPhillips has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 37%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 19%.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with ConocoPhillips' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will have a conference on Jan. 10 to determine whether to hear arguments in Big Oil\u2019s appeal of a Hawaii State Supreme Court decision which allowed a climate lawsuit brought by the city and county of Honolulu against the companies to continue.\n\nHonolulu is seeking to hold Shell, ExxonMobil, Sunoco, BP, Chevron, and other major fossil fuel producers accountable for the costs of climate change in the area and initially filed the lawsuit in state court in March 2020, according to court documents. Honolulu filed an amended complaint in 2021 and courts have declined to dismiss the case or move it to federal jurisdiction in the intervening years, ultimately culminating with a decision by Hawaii\u2019s Supreme Court denying the fossil fuel producers\u2019 motion to dismiss in October 2023.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one of at least 86 climate cases filed against fossil fuel producers since 2015. Supreme Court justices, however, will consider whether to hear the case after the U.S. solicitor general said the official United States position is the Court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction, which Shell called a reversal from prior opinions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court docketed the case in March, following an appeal from Shell, on behalf of the rest of the respondents, arguing that the state supreme court erred by finding the case was not pre-empted by federal laws. The Supreme Court justices asked for the official U.S. position on the appeal in June, and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar delivered the nation\u2019s view early last month.\n\nPrelogar\u2019s Dec. 10 brief said the United States\u2019 official opinion was that the U.S. Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to weigh in on the decision, and \u201ceven if it did [have jurisdiction], further review at this time would be unwarranted.\u201d Prelogar said that the fossil fuel producers have not proved that any other appellate court would have reached a different decision. Additionally, she said constitutional issues of pre-emption of the lawsuit by federal laws or the Clean Air Act have yet to be addressed by the trial court or the Hawaii Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe existence of those pending constitutional issues counsels against review now, which would risk piecemeal review of federal issues by this Court,\u201d Prelogar said. Prelogar also said that even if the oil producers theory that the Clean Air Act would preclude them from being pursued for actions that took place outside of the state, the government\u2019s position is the suit could still be pursued for in-state deceptive practices or pollution.\n\nHowever, Shell and the other respondents categorized Prelogar\u2019s brief as a reversal of the government\u2019s prior position on Clean Air Act preemptions in a Dec. 23 response brief to the Court.\n\n\u201cThe Government reverses its position that the Clean Air Act preempts claims in these climate cases seeking damages for the alleged effects of transboundary emissions from artfully pleaded causes,\u201d the petitioners wrote. \u201cThat reversal deepens an acknowledged conflict only this Court can resolve.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners \u2014 which also include Phillips 66 Company, ConocoPhillips, Aloha Petroleum, Marathon Petroleum and Woodside Energy Hawaii \u2014 said the government makes no explanation for reversing its prior positions, and an \u201cescalating spate of state-court lawsuits seeking damages for global emissions \u2026 requires urgent review.\u201d\n\nFollowing the oil producers\u2019 response, the justices scheduled a conference to determine the next steps for the case, which will take place this Friday, according to the case docket.",

            "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nView our latest analysis for ConocoPhillips\n\nWhat Is ConocoPhillips's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, ConocoPhillips had US$17.3b of debt, at September 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$6.79b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$10.5b.\n\nNYSE:COP Debt to Equity History January 5th 2025\n\nHow Healthy Is ConocoPhillips' Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that ConocoPhillips had liabilities of US$10.8b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$6.79b and US$4.82b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$35.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\n\nWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since ConocoPhillips has a huge market capitalization of US$130.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.",

However, macro uncertainty could weigh on investor sentiment in 2025. In this scenario, investors looking for regular income can consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios.\n\nTop Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive dividend stocks that offer consistent payments, supported by strong fundamentals.\n\nHere are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.\n\nAres Capital\n\nWe start with Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance provider that offers financing solutions to private middle-market companies. With a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share, ARCC stock offers a yield of 8.7%.\n\nIn a research note on the 2025 outlook for business development companies (BDC), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on ARCC with a price target of $23, calling the stock RBC's favorite BDC name for 2025.\n\n\"ARCC has a leading position in the BDC space, with benefits from scale, strong originations engine in the Ares direct lending platform (coverage across all MM segments), and ~20 years of experience and solid performance in the space,\" said Lee.\n\nThe analyst highlighted ARCC's ability to offer flexible capital across various financing solutions for clients as differentiating it from its peers. Lee also noted other strengths, including the company's impressive history in managing risks through the cycle, access to the resources of the Ares Credit Group, and scale advantages, given that it is the largest publicly traded BDC by assets.\n\nLee also emphasized ARCC's dividends, which are backed by the company's core earnings per share and potential net realized gains.\n\nLee ranks No. 23 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.1%. See Ares Capital Ownership Structure on TipRanks.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nWe move to ConocoPhillips (COP), an oil and gas exploration and production company. In October, the company delivered better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and raised its full-year output guidance to reflect the impact of operational efficiencies.\n\nMoreover, ConocoPhillips raised its quarterly dividend by 34% to 78 cents per share and boosted its existing share repurchase authorization by up to $20 billion. Based on an annualized dividend per share of $3.12, COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3%.\n\nIn a research note on the U.S. oil and gas outlook, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar upgraded ConocoPhillips stock to buy from hold and raised the price target to $134 from $132. \"COP offers an enviable combination of long-duration inventory, a fortress balance sheet and peer-leading cash returns,\" said Kumar.\n\nThe analyst noted that the pullback in COP shares since the announcement of the Marathon Oil acquisition indicates that moderate inventory dilution resulting from the deal has already been priced into the stock. Additionally, Kumar noted the company's confidence about achieving significantly high-than-expected deal synergies. Specifically, ConocoPhillips expects to generate about $1 billion in annual synergies, which is twice its initial target of $500 million.\n\nKumar also emphasized that COP expects its 2025 capital expenditure to be below $13 billion, which could translate into additional free cash flow. The analyst believes that with its growing LNG presence and strong commercial marketing business, the company is well-positioned to gain from the rising global LNG demand and international pricing.\n\nKumar ranks No. 336 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See ConocoPhillips Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.\n\nDarden Restaurants\n\nFinally, let's look at Darden Restaurants (DRI), a restaurant company that owns several popular brands like Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. The company recently announced its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and raised its annual sales guidance.\n\nAlong with its Q2 FY25 results, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, payable on Feb. 3. At a quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share (annualized dividend of $5.60), DRI offers a yield of about 3%.\n\nFollowing the results, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on DRI stock and raised the price target to $205 from $195, saying that \"management has multiple levers to achieve full-year guidance.\" He thinks that while the results were encouraging, the impact of hurricanes and the Thanksgiving calendar shift overshadowed certain favorable sales trends.\n\nHighlighting the strong performance of the LongHorn Steakhouse and Olive Garden chains, the analyst noted that the rise in visits from lower-and middle-income consumers reflected a notable turnaround from the trends observed in recent quarters.\n\nAmong the other positives, Saleh also noted the faster-than-anticipated rollout of Uber Eats delivery and the reducing value gap compared with quick-service restaurants, thanks to Darden's restrained pricing. The analyst expects all these positive factors to drive robust performance in the second half of fiscal 2025. Overall, Saleh views Darden as an industry-leading restaurant operator delivering consistent earnings growth at a lucrative valuation.\n\nSaleh ranks No. 366 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.8%. See Darden Restaurants Hedge Funds Activity on TipRanks.",

END \u2013 Apple News Only Block\n\nIf you receive a typical salary, the top executives in Canada\u2019s oilsands have already been paid more money than you will make for the entire year.\n\nThe Narwhal looked at the compensation received by the highest-ranking executives last year at the top six oilsands producers, a group called the Pathways Alliance.\n\nThose companies include Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Suncor, Cenovus, ConocoPhillips Canada, MEG Energy and Imperial Oil. Three days into 2025, their top-paid executives will have made the median Canadian salary \u2014 and then some.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the lowest on the list \u2014 Derek Evans, president and chief executive officer at MEG Energy, was compensated $5,354,731 in 2023\n\nThat\u2019s about $20,595.12 per day.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u2018median\u2019 Canadian was compensated $213 per day last year. The median salary, drawn from Stats Canada data, represents the midpoint of Canadian salaries. That means half of Canadians made more than this figure, and half made less.\n\nIf each dollar was a kilometre, a median-earning Canadian could get from Ottawa to Montreal, while Evans could travel halfway around the Earth each day.\n\nDerek Evans, president and chief executive officer at MEG Energy, was compensated $5,354,731 in 2023. Photo: MEG Energy\n\nThree days into 2025, Evans has likely been compensated $61,785 \u2014 higher than the median annual income of Canadians between the ages of 25 and 54, which is $55,300. (For the purposes of this analysis, we excluded the youngest and oldest Canadians, who have lower salaries.)\n\nIn the middle of the pack, Brad Corson, chairman, president and chief executive officer at Imperial Oil Ltd., was paid $14,831,530 in 2023\n\nThat means he netted the typical yearly salary in one day.\n\nIf every dollar meant you got a second of vacation, the average Canadian would get a little less than two days off, while Corson would get more than 24 weeks.\n\nAt the top of the list is Richard Kruger, president and CEO at Suncor, but his 2023 compensation \u2014 a whopping $36,946,735 \u2014 was a notable package to draw him out of retirement\n\nThat works out to $141,103 per working day \u2014 or $17,763 per hour, if you assume a regular eight-hour workday. A Canadian (of any age) working full-time was paid a median wage of roughly $1,400 per week last year.\n\nAt his rate, Kruger could have been compensated a typical Canadian\u2019s salary by lunch time on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nOften these executives\u2019 salaries are a small chunk of their final compensation, which is driven by cash and stock incentives. Though compensation fluctuates, overall executives are making more year over year.\n\nRyan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer at ConocoPhillips Canada, was compensated $20,770,673 in 2023\n\nIf every dollar equalled one square kilometre, the average Canadian would have a land base about the size of Lake Michigan, while Lance would have a land base as big as Canada and the United States put together.\n\nRyan Lance, chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips, was one of the top-paid executives at Canada\u2019s most prominent oilsands companies. Photo: Bartolomej Tomic / Flickr\n\nDespite profits, oilsands companies pay low fines, receive government support\n\nFines that these companies pay for significant environmental damage are also notably lower than the annual compensation packages of top executives.\n\nSuncor had $9 billion in 2023 earnings and has polluted the Athabasca River repeatedly, but fines have never exceeded $1 million, PhD student Ben R. Collison reported for The Conversation.\n\nImperial Oil faced a $1.1-million fine this year for a 2021 oil spill in Sarnia, Ont., which included a $225,000 victim surcharge for causing illness to people living nearby. Meanwhile, its top three executives were paid $3.2 million, $5.8 million and $14.8 million, and its profits for 2023 were $4.9 billion.\n\nAlex Pourbaix, executive chair at Cenovus Energy, received a lifetime achievement award from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in 2024. He was paid $8,109,923 in 2023. Photo: Cenovus Energy\n\nAnd despite ballooning profits and sky-high executive compensation, Pathways Alliance is seeking taxpayer money to support its endeavours. The alliance plans to build a large carbon capture and storage network to capture emissions from oilsands facilities and send them down a pipeline to an underground storage area. The group has campaigned for extensive government financial and regulatory support to achieve the $16-billion carbon capture plan, including public subsidies worth up to 50 per cent of their operating costs.\n\nHere\u2019s what the top-earning executive at each Pathways Alliance member made\n\nThe top-paid executives in Canada\u2019s oilsands have already earned the typical Canadian\u2019s salary just one week into the new year, when looking at their 2023 compensation. Illustration: Shawn Parkinson / The Narwhal\n\nTo make these estimates, The Narwhal assumed annual salaries included paid statutory holidays and vacation, and used an eight-hour day to calculate rates. We did not incorporate overtime, taxes and other variables. The Narwhal chose to measure Canadians\u2019 income between 25 and 54 in our central comparison because teens, young workers and people approaching retirement are often being paid less.\n\nThese numbers are based on 2023 compensation for executives and 2022 salary data from Statistics Canada, the most recent years available.\n\nThe Narwhal focused on the oil and gas industry since we cover resource extraction and the natural world, but some of the other top-paid executives in Canada work in industries like telecommunications, transportation and more. A 2023 report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found Canada\u2019s highest-earning chief executive officers received larger pay increases in the previous year compared to regular Canadians, with an average salary increase of 4.4 per cent \u2014 equivalent to $623,000.\n\nIncome equality in Canada has literally never been higher. The income gap between the richest and poorest Canadians is the widest it has been since Statistics Canada started collecting data in 1999.\n\n\u2014 With files from Carl Meyer",

(CITGO)\n\nCaracas, December 31, 2025 (venezuelanalysis.com) \u2013 Delaware District Judge Leonard Stark has ordered the relaunch of a bidding process for Venezuelan-owned refiner CITGO.\n\nOn December 18, Stark determined that the company\u2019s data room be opened to potential buyers. Court-appointed \u201cSpecial Master\u201d Robert Pincus, charged with overseeing the sale, proposed a three-month bidding period. He would then offer his recommendation to the court in April 2025 ahead of a final sale hearing in mid-2025.\n\nIn October 2022, Stark launched an auction of shares belonging to PDV Holding (PDVH), CITGO\u2019s parent company, to satisfy creditor claims against Venezuela. Most of the debt stemmed from international arbitration awards in favor of corporations that had assets nationalized by the Venezuelan state.\n\nThe court recognized 18 claims totaling US $21.3 billion, with firms set to be compensated on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis. Crystallex ($1.0 billion), Tidewater ($80 million), ConocoPhillips ($1.3 billion) and O-I Glass ($700 million) are the first on the list.\n\nThe Delaware court decided to seek new offers following strong opposition to a winning proposal chosen by Pincus. In September, the special master picked a $7.3 billion bid from vulture fund Elliott Management subsidiary Amber Energy as the auction winner. However, creditors rejected both the offer\u2019s amount and sale terms, forcing the bidding process to restart.\n\nThe revamped proceedings may include a so-called \u201cstalking horse bid\u201d which would set a minimum price for CITGO. For its part, Amber stated that its purchase agreement was now \u201cmoot.\u201d Crystallex, Red Tree Investments and Gold Reserve have at different points expressed interest in submitting proposals.\n\nThough the process might yield higher offers, the auction might be affected by parallel lawsuits pursued by some of the Delaware creditors.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Stark ruled out issuing an injunction to block Gramercy Distressed Opportunity Fund, G&A Strategic Investments and Siemens Energy from seeking compensation through separate litigation. The corporations have filed lawsuits in New York and Texas courts in attempts to collect on respective $537 million, $1.1 billion and $194 million debts, stating that their positions on the Delaware creditor list mean they are unlikely to collect on their claims.\n\nPincus had urged the judge to bar the parallel legal efforts to stop creditors from \u201cjumping the line.\u201d He likewise argued that the added risk could hurt potential offers. Nevertheless, Stark rejected the motion to file an injunction as lacking a legal basis.\n\nBesides the separate judicial cases, the CITGO court-mandated sale must also account for the holders of the defaulted PDVSA 2020 bond, for which 50.1 percent of the refiner\u2019s shares were pledged as collateral. Successive protection orders from the US Treasury Department have stopped bondholders from executing the collateral.\n\nSpecial Master Pincus has unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the PDVSA 2020 bondholders. The eventual new CITGO ownership will have to settle with the bondholders, potentially lowering auction offer amounts.\n\nEstimated at $11-13 billion, CITGO has been under the control of the US-backed opposition since 2019 following the Trump administration\u2019s recognition of the Juan Guaid\u00f3-led self-proclaimed \u201cinterim government.\u201d Guaid\u00f3 and his associates have drawn accusations of malpractice and conflicts of interest that ballooned CITGO\u2019s liabilities.\n\nIn 2021, US oil giant ConocoPhillips secured a default ruling to collect on an $8.5 billion arbitration award after \u201cinterim government\u201d lawyers failed to appear in court. The debt has since surpassed $10 billion with interest. ConocoPhillips managed to tag its claim to the Delaware auction in 2023.\n\nFor its part, the Venezuelan government has condemned the court-ordered sale of its most important foreign asset as \u201cthe theft of the century.\u201d The Nicol\u00e1s Maduro administration has vowed to challenge the loss of the refiner. However, because it is not recognized by Washington, it remains barred from presenting its case in US courts.\n\nA subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, CITGO owns three refineries with a combined capacity to process 769,000 barrels per day (bpd). The firm\u2019s portfolio likewise includes a pipeline network and over 4,000 service stations, mostly on the US East Coast.",

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nNearly four years ago, Joe Biden kicked off his presidency by killing the Keystone XL pipeline and suspending new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits on federal land. Now, as he heads for the exit, the administration is going out the same way: siding with efforts by cities and states to use local nuisance laws to punish international energy companies for selling oil and gas.\n\nHonolulu filed a lawsuit against Sunoco, Exxon, ConocoPhillips and other energy companies in 2020, accusing them of creating a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d by producing fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the companies misled the public about the facts about energy and carbon emissions.\n\nThe energy companies argued that claims addressing climate change are regulated by federal laws such as the Clean Air Act, not conflicting state laws, and that allowing cities and states this license will lead to litigation chaos. Last spring, they filed a petition with the Supreme Court, urging it to step in and clarify whether federal laws apply to these claims.\n\nIt\u2019s an analysis embraced by John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the George W. Bush Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cIf Honolulu gets away with such a lawsuit, states could be encouraged to concoct similarly unlimited theories of tort liability that interfere with the nation\u2019s ability to pursue coherent policies on energy and climate change,\u201d Yoo recently wrote in National Review.\n\nThe lawsuit is part of a national effort by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and Democratic-governed cities, counties and states to use state and local power to take action against global energy companies. Lawsuits such as Honolulu\u2019s have been filed from Maine to California. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul recently signed legislation forcing fossil fuel producers to pay the Empire State $75 billion over the next quarter century to address the effects of climate change.\n\nThe administration\u2019s stance in the Honolulu case is a stark reversal of the positions of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. In 2020, the past solicitor general argued cases involving cross-boundary pollution \u201c\u2018may well be thought to \u2018arise under\u2019 federal law for \u2018jurisdictional purposes.\u2019\u201d This opinion involved a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore against global oil and gas companies.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court took up the case reviewing the Baltimore case, then-Assistant Solicitor General Brinton Lucas argued the lawsuit was \u201cinherently federal in nature\u201d because it involved alleged injuries \u201ccaused by emissions from all over the world\u201d that can\u2019t be subjected to conflicting state-based regulations.\n\nThe Supreme Court then ruled 7-1 in favor of the oil companies, directing the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review all of the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional arguments.\n\nIn October 2023, the Hawaiian Supreme Court allowed the Honolulu case to proceed under state laws. Fast-forward to today, the Biden administration is reversing the government\u2019s stance on federal supremacy to keep the Supreme Court from considering the case.\n\nIn a Dec. 10 brief to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar cited lower court rulings as part of her argument that local governments should be allowed to wield this power.\n\n\u201cAfter the change in administration and in light of those intervening developments, the United States has re-examined its position and has concluded that state-law claims like those pleaded here should not be recharacterized as claims arising under federal common law,\u201d Prelogar also wrote in a 2023 brief to the Supreme Court in a different case.\n\nCritics of the administration note Prelogar waited for months to respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s request for input from the administration, not filing her brief until after the November election.\n\nThe energy companies filed a reply to the solicitor general\u2019s brief last week, arguing that \u201cthe consistent position of the United States, as expressed to this court and lower courts in previous cases, has been that federal law precludes the application of state law to transboundary pollution claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s decision flatly contradicts U.S. Supreme Court precedent and other federal circuit court decisions,\u201d added Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., counsel for Chevron Corp. \u201cIn dismissing a nearly identical lawsuit, the 2nd Circuit held, \u2018such a sprawling case is simply beyond the limits of state law.\u2019 The Supreme Court should grant review now to prevent pointless harm to our nation\u2019s energy security.\u201d\n\nHistory appears to be on their side.\n\nIn a 2010 case, Obama administration acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal criticized a \u201cpotentially open-ended series of common-law suits in far-flung district courts\u201d in a Supreme Court brief. Justices were considering a suit by New York City and six states against five private electric power companies over the use of fossil fuels. Katyal suggested a regulatory solution \u201cwill be far better suited to addressing the scope of (climate change) and to fashioning an appropriately tailored set of remedies.\u201d A unanimous Supreme Court agreed with an opinion by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nYoo believes the Commerce Clause in the Constitution grants the federal government the power to intervene. He worries about what could happen if the Supreme Court is not involved.\n\n\u201cStates could punish out-of-state companies for temperature changes brought about by a truly national \u2014 indeed international \u2014 weather dynamic. Energy-producing states would likely respond with retaliatory measures against blue states,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTaylor Millard writes about politics and public policy for InsideSources.com.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A US judge reset the bidding process for the parent company of Citgo Petroleum Corp. late Tuesday, a move that is poised to create competition for Elliott Investment Management\u2019s pursuit of the oil refiner.\n\nJudge Leonard Stark ordered the bidding for the company to be reopened, allowing for new offers to be submitted. Any proposal would have to top the $7.3 billion bid made by an affiliate of Elliott earlier this year.\n\nStark, who heard arguments on the matter on Dec. 13 in Wilmington, Delaware, has now cleared the way for other creditors \u2014 including Gold Reserve, Crystallex International Corp. and Red Tree Investments LLC.\n\nThe decision puts a new twist on a years-long legal battle over control of the parent of Citgo, a Venezuela-owned foreign asset that operates three refineries in the US, pipelines, terminals and fuel distribution channels. The proceeds of the sale will pay back a long list of creditors that are collectively owed around $20 billion by the Venezuelan government and its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, over asset seizures in the country.\n\nCrystallex, which saw its Venezuelan gold mines seized by the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is first in line for a hefty slice of the proceeds. Others include Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips Co. and Siemens AG.\n\nStark, who authorized the auction last year, had hoped to have the sale of the parent company, PDV Holding, finished by the end of the year.\n\nIn his ruling Tuesday, he set a new hearing on the sale for late July in Wilmington.\n\nCreditor Pushback\n\nStark ordered an additional marketing period, to begin as soon as possible. Evercore Inc shall review and evaluate \u201cas to whether other parties that might be interested in participating in the sale process should be contacted,\u201d Stark wrote in the Tuesday ruling.\n\nThe changes come after Special Master Robert Pincus, whom Stark tapped to manage the auction, urged the judge to overhaul the process after some creditors criticized it as lacking transparency and unfairly favoring the bid by the Elliott affiliate, Amber Energy Inc. Pincus suggested that it be restructured, as that creditor pushback mounted.\n\nStark had found that court officials improperly cut off access to information about Amber Energy\u2019s bid and Citgo\u2019s financial health to creditors weighing a bid. He also indicated he was disappointed with the sums generated by the bidding, which would leave many creditors\u2019 claims unsatisfied.\n\nThe sale process is at a turning point, as Stark seeks to maximize revenue for the creditors, some of which have filed separate suits seeking recoveries in courts outside Delaware. Those cases have added another layer of legal risks for any potential buyer.\n\nCh\u00e1vez, first elected in the late 1990s, nationalized major industries as part of a socialist agenda during his 14-year reign. He died in 2013 and was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Affected companies, which also include holders of other kinds of debt, secured judgments and filed them in Delaware in hopes of winning restitution.\n\nBig Refiner\n\nA World Bank arbitration panel in 2016 found that Venezuela owed Crystallex $1.4 billion, of which it is seeking to recover about $1 billion. A pair of Exxon oil projects were expropriated in 2007, and the company is seeking to have $984 million in claims recognized.\n\nCitgo processes more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day and is the seventh-largest US refiner.\n\nThe case is Crystallex International Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 17-mc-00151, US District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).\n\n(Updates with details starting in paragraph eight.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Learn more.\n\n'Remarkably like Normandy\u2019 - Brancaster Beach in the U.K.\n\nAfter spending four days shrapnel hunting on the Normandy beaches, the geologists wrapped up their field trip with a visit to Brancaster Beach in the U.K., gathering sand samples so they could compare the sand on this beach to the sand found on the Normandy beaches.\n\nErin Pemberton displays a magnet with metal and magnetite particles attached to it on Sword Beach.\n\nBrancaster Beach was used by the Allies to test heavy vehicles before the D-Day landings. The goal was to ensure these vehicles wouldn\u2019t get bogged down on the Normandy beaches, a lesson learned from the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid in northern France, a disastrous amphibious assault that left thousands of Allied troops dead and wounded.\n\n\u201cThe military geologists did an amazing job identifying this analog beach,\u201d Laycock said. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkably like Normandy. I\u2019m curious to see how the lab analysis of the sand goes, and just how similar it is.\u201d\n\nGeology played a major part in the D-Day invasion. Dallin Laycock, geologist\n\nPreserving history, delivering insight\n\nBack in the U.S., Hudson and his BYU undergraduate and graduate students have started analyzing the 300 sand samples using a variety of techniques to confirm how much of the magnetic pieces are shrapnel.\n\nThe four geologists collected 300 sand samples from the five D-Day beaches. These samples are from Juno Beach.\n\n\u201cWe are analyzing the sand samples at this stage through particle size analysis,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cSamples were taken along surface transects and through coring to understand how sediment, both shrapnel and sand, is distributed along the beaches of Normandy. This tells us about how ocean waves and tides redistribute sand along this part of the French coast and helps us to understand the dynamics of a complex coastal system like this. The shrapnel is a fantastic tracer of these processes. We know, almost to the day, when some of this material was placed on the beach. If we can understand where it is now (both spatially and at depth), we can better understand how beaches redistribute sediment over time. The shrapnel acts as a fantastic tracer for understanding coastal erosion and deposition.\u201d\n\nThe research results will be published in peer-reviewed international journals.\n\nFor Hudson, this project has provided a unique opportunity, enabling him to pursue his passion for geologic research and honor his grandfather, who served in the Pacific during World War II.\n\n\u201cThis has been a great way for me to feel closer to him and to better appreciate the sacrifices made by so many,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nBy identifying and differentiating between shrapnel and naturally occurring magnetic minerals in the sand, Laycock said researchers may be able to map out the intensity and spread of the battle, providing a clearer picture of where the heaviest fighting occurred.\n\nErin Pemberton collects samples on Sword Beach on June 5.\n\nAnd by documenting and analyzing their geological findings, Laycock said they are helping preserve the history of D-Day for future generations, creating a more detailed and accurate picture of the events that took place during the invasion.\n\n\u201cWe believe our geological research will deepen humanity\u2019s understanding of D-Day,\u201d Laycock said. \u201cThis is about using science to tell a more comprehensive story. We hope our work inspires a deeper interest in both geology and history.\u201d",

            "content": "As ConocoPhillips builds its huge Willow oil drilling project on the western side of Alaska\u2019s North Slope, federal regulators and residents of the nearest I\u00f1upiat village have struck a deal for a new type of environmental oversight to minimize impact of the development.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced this month that it signed a right-of-way agreement with a partnership comprising the Nuiqsut city government, Nuiqsut\u2019s tribal government and the Kuukpik Corp., the Inupiat village\u2019s for-profit Native corporation.\n\nThe three entities, combined to form Nuiqsut Trilateral Inc., have authority over about 1 million acres of land encircling Teshekpuk Lake, the largest lake on the North Slope. The area is key habitat for the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd, among other wildlife populations.\n\nThe right-of-way agreement prohibits any new leasing, roads, any surface or subsurface exploration activities or oil-related gravel or sand mining on that parcel of land for the duration of Willow\u2019s operations.\n\nThe purpose of the agreement, signed Dec. 17, is to \u201coffset the impacts on the herd from the Willow Project by providing durable and long-term protection for the herd by prohibiting certain activities and facilities within the protected property for the benefit of the herd and the herd\u2019s most important habitat,\u201d according to the document.\n\nMap provided by U.S. Bureau of Land Management A conservation right-of-way encircling Teshekpuk Lake, established through an agreement between the U.S. Bureau of Land Managment and Nuiqsut\u2019s city government, tribal government and village for-profit Native corporation, is seen on this map. The map is from the signed right-of-way agreement.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Nuiqsut Trilateral Inc. has the option to waive any or all of the restrictions.\n\nWillow, which lies in the federally managed National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, is set to become the westernmost producing oil field on Alaska\u2019s North Slope.\n\nWillow is expected to start producing oil in 2029, and output is expected to peak at 180,000 barrels per day. In comparison, total production of North Slope oil, which peaked in 1988 at over 2 million barrels per day, averaged 461,000 barrels a day for the 12 months that ended on June 30, according to the Alaska Department of Revenue.\n\nThe new right-of-way agreement does not establish an additional area of protection. The affected 1 million acres holds no active leases and is already part of the designated 3.65 million-acre Teshekpuk Lake Special Area, where development is limited, the BLM said. But it does establish a new type of protection that is led by the community.\n\nKuukpik said it was the entity that first suggested the right-of-way arrangement. Although the Native corporation opposes establishment of any new additional protected areas in the National Petroleum Reserve, the right-of-way concept puts conservation decisions in the hands of the local people and \u201cis a completely community-led effort that BLM has adopted and supported from the ground up,\u201d Kuukpik President George Sielak said in a letter sent to the BLM on Sept. 16.\n\nKuukpik has acknowledged that Willow development will \u201cnegatively impact\u201d the Teshekpuk herd, and additional protections for the caribou were needed to gain the corporation\u2019s support for the project, the letter said. Because of that, Kuupik proposed the arrangement as \u201can additive, forward-looking mitigation measure that was carefully designed specifically to offset Willow\u2019s likely impacts to the herd by preventing oil and gas development during the life of the Willow Project in the core areas that were most vital to the herd\u2019s continued survival and success,\u201d the letter said.\n\nMap provided by ConocoPhillips\n\nThe Biden administration approved Willow development in March of 2023, despite objections from environmentalists about potential climate-change impacts from the additional oil development. Nuiqsut\u2019s tribal and city governments, now part of Nuiqsut Trilateral Inc., opposed Willow at the time, citing potential disruption of movement for the Teshekpuk herd and concerns that more industrialization would impede villagers\u2019 traditional subsistence hunting and food-gathering practices. But the Nuiqsut governments have since changed their position on Willow.\n\nWhile Willow is being built, ConocoPhillips has been developing several smaller production sites on the western side of the North Slope.\n\nThe newest is Nuna, which began producing on Dec. 17, a bit ahead of the expected early 2025 startup. It is a satellite in the Kuparuk River Unit, meaning its oil is processed at existing Kuparuk facilities. Nuna has 29 wells and is the 49th drill site to be developed in the Kuparuk unit, ConocoPhillips said.\n\nOther new sites that started producing oil in recent years on the western side of the North Slope are ConocoPhillips\u2019 Fiord West Kuparuk and Narwhal, both in the Colville River Unit on state land bordering the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. They started production in 2023 and 2022 respectively, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson said.",

So has the president-elect: \u201cBig Tech has run wild for years,\u201d Trump said in a Dec. 4 social media post announcing Gail Slater as his choice to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\n\nTrump has also expressed disapproval of United States Steel Corp\u2019s sale to Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel Corp.\n\nHere are three sectors the Big Law dealmakers are closely watching in 2025.\n\nEnergy\n\nTrump\u2019s goal to boost energy production could mean looser oversight of the oil and gas industry, which has already seen significant consolidation.\n\nSeveral large energy deals were slowed by Biden administration antitrust regulators who used \u201csecond requests\u201d to prevent certain transactions from closing during investigations. The FTC allowed high-profile energy deals to go through following the reviews, but some Republicans criticized the agency for needlessly scrutinizing the transactions..\n\nThe agency in May cleared Exxon Mobil Corp.'s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., on the condition that Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield not join Exxon\u2019s board. The FTC also green-lit Chevron Corp.'s $53 billion purchase of oil rival Hess Corp. in September. ConocoPhillips completed its $17 billion deal to buy Marathon Oil Corp. two months later.\n\nPending energy deals include oilfield services company SLB\u2019s $7.75 billion acquisition of rival ChampionX, which received a second request for more information from the Justice Department in July. It is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.\n\nBanking\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House is likely to pave the way for Capital One Financial Corp.'s takeover of Discover Financial Services, which will create the world\u2019s largest credit card issuer by loan volume. Both companies saw shares spike following Trump\u2019s November win.\n\nThe deal is pending approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, while the DOJ could still weigh in.\n\nRegulators will also inherit several existing cases, including the Justice Department\u2019s September lawsuit against Visa, which alleges that Visa has a monopoly over debit network markets. Meador worked on DOJ antitrust investigations in the first Trump administration, including the department\u2019s challenge of Visa\u2019s proposed $5.3 billion merger with Plaid. The companies walked away from the deal after the department sued to block it.\n\n\n\nTech\n\nTrump and his backers have been vocal critics of the industry, promising on the campaign trail to put tech companies under a microscope in his second term.\n\nAntitrust regulators will inherit ongoing cases against Amazon, Google, and Meta, as well as an investigation into Microsoft. They will have big decisions to make, including whether to continue the Biden DOJ\u2019s push to break up Google.\n\nMeador was an adviser to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) when he introduced a bill that would have forced Google to break up its digital advertising business.\n\nTrump and other Republicans also have long complained about perceived censorship by Big Tech companies.\n\n\u201cAt the FTC, we will end Big Tech\u2019s vendetta against competition and free speech,\u201d Ferguson wrote in a memo circulated after Trump announced Ferguson would be tapped to lead the agency.",

            "content": "Last week, we discussed the \" Dogs of the Dow (and S & P 500) \" investment strategies, in which investors rank the stocks in the respective indices by their dividend yield at the end of each year and rebalance into those with the highest yields. Because this strategy involves selecting the highest dividend-yielding stocks from the S & P 500 , it is potentially attractive for income-focused investors. Dividend yield, representing the annual dividend payout as a stock price percentage, is a key metric in this strategy. While high-yielding stocks can be risky, thorough research into a company's financial health can help mitigate these risks. Last week, for example, we noted that most of the top 10 highest dividend yields in the S & P 500 are from companies whose revenue growth has failed to keep pace with the nominal gross domestic product growth or inflation, meaning that those companies were shrinking in real terms. As we also pointed out in our earlier article, cyclical businesses, such as those that are heavily tied to commodity prices, may not see consistent revenue or earnings growth from one year to the next. However, these companies may exhibit favorable revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth using a longer-term trendline that accounts for the fluctuations through the business cycle. This column is the second in a series of three on trade ideas involving the \"dogs.\" Energy's lackluster performance in 2024 The energy sector materially underperformed the S & P 500 in 2024, with a total return of about 8.7%, including dividends. The price of oil, which has remained unchanged since early 2022, isn't helping. Looking at the primary drivers of oil supply and demand, it isn't difficult to see why. Global oil demand growth has not kept pace with economic growth, even as oil and gas production in the United States, the world's largest energy producer, hit all-time highs . Stagnant demand with ample supply is a poor recipe for higher oil prices. That said, accessible and affordable energy is more broadly positive for the global economy, and business optimism has improved since the election. The December 2024 IEA Oil Market Report estimates that global oil demand growth is set to accelerate, \"lifting consumption to 103.9 mb/d in 2025.\" Meanwhile, OPEC+ delayed unwinding its additional voluntary production cuts by three months. Overall, global oil markets appear well-supplied, so a significant uptick in oil prices isn't anticipated. Nevertheless, several energy companies, including a couple with high-dividend yields, have been performing well enough, even with sub-$70 per barrel oil prices to warrant a look. One of these is Houston, Texas-based exploration-and-production company ConocoPhillips . The company \u2014 which completed its acquisition of Marathon Oil for just under $23 billion on Nov. 22 \u2014 is likely to return more than $10 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks in 2025, more than 8% of the company's current market capitalization. Conoco is trading close to its longer-term average historical multiples at around 12-times forward earnings estimates and 4.9-times EV/EBITDA. COP YTD mountain ConocoPhillips in 2024 Revenues and earnings have been quite volatile \u2014 as expected for an oil company \u2014 but both are considerably higher than five years ago. For example, the FY 2025 revenue estimates of roughly $60 billion are more than 80% higher than FY 2020 revenues of $32.6 billion. The company's consistent dividend growth since 2015 should be maintainable with a strong balance sheet. One way to get some long exposure to the stock while collecting some additional income above and beyond the dividend in options premiums is with a \"buy-write.\" The options trade A buy-write is an options trading strategy involving buying a stock and selling a call option. Investors who seek to generate additional income from their stock holdings while limiting potential upside gains often use this strategy. I favor keeping the short call in a buy-write strategy short-dated and prefer to avoid writing options through quarterly earnings releases, catalysts when a stock can move sharply. Because a buy-write involves owning the underlying stock, it requires equity risk, for which investors should be sufficiently compensated. One should choose call strikes that provide some upside potential for capital appreciation. One can currently purchase Conoco stock for about $95 a share while collecting more than 1% of the current stock price ( > 12% annualized) for selling the $100 strike calls, which expire well before the company's next estimated earnings release in February 2025. Although selling the upside calls does cap potential gains over the next several weeks, between the $1.05/share one should collect for selling the calls and the roughly $5 difference between the current stock price and the strike of the calls, the maximum potential gain between now and January expiration is more than 6% of the current stock price.
