Live minutes away at Liberty Township apartments | Going Up\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption The Enquirer's Going Up series tracks real estate, construction Keep up with local development and construction on Cincinnati.com\n\nReal estate in Greater Cincinnati is booming. Here at The Enquirer, we aim to bring you in-depth real estate coverage about the developments and neighborhood issues you care about the most. Going Up is a series that introduces you to the need-to-know projects around the region.\n\nSubmit suggestions to sfranklin@enquirer.com or tag @Enquirer on social media. Please include the address or cross streets of the project you want us to look into.\n\nThe basics of Relay 129\n\nWhat you need to know about Relay 129: An 18-building community with clubhouse, heated pool\n\nLiberty Township's Freedom Pointe development already includes Butler County's Costco store and gas station. Soon, it will also be home to Relay 129, an 18-building, 402-unit housing community.\n\nBlue Ash-based Hills Properties broke ground on the development in January. Housing options range from one-bedroom apartments to three-bedroom townhomes. The building breakdown includes two walk-up apartment buildings, two buildings with elevators, four buildings with a first-level garage, nine townhome buildings and one clubhouse. The tallest building will be five stories.\n\nHills also left room for a future commercial development. But the aspect they're most excited about is the clubhouse: an almost-10,000-square-foot building with an indoor-outdoor fitness center, deck with grills and a rooftop lounge overlooking a heated pool.\n\n\"I think the big-ticket items here are the rooftop terrace and the indoor-outdoor fitness space,\" said Hills Chief Operating Officer Justin Seger. \"That's something new for us and we're really excited about it.\"\n\nOther community amenities include a private work-from-home space and a business center.\n\nThe complex name, Relay 129, is a two-part nod to the area and its history. The Voice of America Bethany Relay Station was a radio station used during World War II and the Cold War. It was one of the most powerful radio stations in the world at that time and reached millions of listeners across the globe.\n\nThe station is now a museum located at West Chester's Voice of America MetroPark, which Seger said is perhaps the apartment complex's \"greatest amenity.\"\n\n129 is a reference to Ohio Route 129, which crosses Interstate 75 and feeds into the complex.\n\nWhat will Relay 129 apartments look like?\n\nRelay 129 is the largest community Hills has built in Greater Cincinnati. The developer went big inside the homes, too.\n\nAll bedrooms can fit a king-size bed and two nightstands, said Hills Chief Operating Officer Brandon Guttman. The kitchens also offer larger-than-normal cabinets and stainless steel appliances, mosaic glass tile backsplashes, soft-close cabinets and drawers, and quartz countertops. All homes also come with an outdoor space \u2012 a patio or balcony \u2012 and a laundry room. Many units have a guest bathroom.\n\nRental prices are estimated to range between $1,700 and $3,500 depending on the floor plan and style, Seger said.\n\nHere\u2019s where the project stands and what\u2019s ahead\n\nHills broke ground on the project in January. They're aiming to open the homes for rent in early 2026.\n\nSeger declined to provide the project's total cost.\n\nHow will Relay 129 fit into Liberty Township?\n\nRelay 129 has been part of Freedom Pointe since its inception. In 2021, Liberty Township trustees approved a zoning change to make way for the Costco that anchors one side of Freedom Pointe and preliminary plans for Relay 129 on the other. At the time, the development was narrowly approved by the township's zoning commission and got some pushback from residents.\n\nFast-forward to today: Freedom Pointe also has two hospitals, medical offices and a hotel. On the other side of I-75 is Liberty Center, and just up the highway will be the Millikin Road interchange, creating more space for commercial development.\n\n\"It's such a convenient place to live,\" said Seger, who lives in the township. \"You have healthcare, you have shopping, you have dining and entertainment. The Voices of America Country Music Fest has turned into one of the largest country music festivals in the Midwest. You're in the middle of the action.\"\n\nSeger wants Relay 129 to add to that energy. The housing development could bring 750 to 1,000 renters to the area, he said. He envisions renters playing golf at the two courses behind the complex, or watching Mason's Fourth of July fireworks from the rooftop terrace.\n\n\"We love the location here,\" he said. \"Liberty Township is a fantastic place to live.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to add video.",

Strangely, there wasn\u2019t a single report of a stolen car at Costco during the years when the problem was at its worst citywide.\n\nAshley DiMino\u2019s car was stolen on Sunday, March 9th, after she parked just two rows from the front door and was in the store for only 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cI raced my kids to the car and my car was not there,\u201d DiMino said.\n\nWhen police found her car, the driver\u2019s side mirrors and handle were gone, and the inside was trashed.\n\nNews10NBC\u2019s Chief Investigative Reporter Berkeley Brean noted the unusual timing of the thefts.\n\nBerkeley Brean, News10NBC: \u201cYou know the interesting thing is when you look at the data there wasn\u2019t a single car stolen throughout the whole stolen car epidemic.\u201d\n\nAshley DiMino: \u201cRight.\u201d\n\nBerkeley Brean: \u201cAnd then in March, this is a target.\u201d\n\nAshley DiMino: \u201cMine was the fourth one, yeah.\u201d\n\nThe RPD crime tracking portal shows cars stolen at Costco every Saturday and Sunday in March, all in the early afternoon.\n\nBerkeley Brean: \u201cIs there anything Costco can do that you would like to see?\u201d\n\nAshley DiMino: \u201cRight, I would love for them to hire some security. When I talk to the Costco employees they say yeah, this just keeps happening and what are we going to do about it?\u201d\n\nToni Haney\u2019s car was also stolen from the Costco parking lot on Saturday, March 8th, and was found trashed as well.\n\nBerkeley Brean: \u201cDo you think there ought to be more security in the parking lot?\u201d\n\nToni Haney: \u201cI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s that. I think it more that these are young children. And there\u2019s no ramifications for these children.\u201d\n\nBerkeley Brean: \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a store problem, it\u2019s a society problem.\u201d\n\nToni Haney: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that prevents having your car stolen in a parking lot. But I think it\u2019s more that there is no punishment for these children.\u201d\n\nWegmans and Walmart pay RPD to have a marked car in their parking lots on East and Hudson Avenues at a rate of $107 per hour per officer. RPD says it does not have a request from Costco for that security, and not every request is granted.\n\nRPD reports zero stolen cars at the East Ave Wegmans over the last three years. Costco has not replied to News10NBC\u2019s email asking if it\u2019s considering more security.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the RPD\u2019s crime portal shows a spike in stolen cars in 2023, averaging 26 per week. Last year, the average was cut in half to 40 per week, and two years ago, it was 75 per week.\n\nA.I. assisted with the formatting of this story. Click here to see how WHEC News 10 uses A.I.",

While product shortages dropped 25%, mentions of discrimination rose by 16.5%, posing reputational risks that could affect future satisfaction rankings.\n\nTarget, known for prioritizing customer service, saw mixed results in 2024. While reviews showed slight improvements in associate interactions, concerns about return policies and anti-theft measures were still prevalent.\n\nOn Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), Costco remains an outlier, standing firm on its initiatives, while Walmart and Target have scaled back their efforts in this area.\n\nRetailers are taking steps to address these challenges \u2013 improving staffing, training, and operational efficiency \u2013 but the ongoing threat of tariffs and shifting supply chains may continue to create hurdles.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled a list of the top 10 retailers ranked by customer service.

It notes that products subjected to the notice were shipped to a distribution center and retail stores in Florida.\n\nA press release regarding the safety notice was first issued on Oct. 25, 2024, and remains ongoing due to concern over potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes. At the time of the recall notice, buyers of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon were encouraged to return or discard products subjected to the recall.\n\nThe lot number can be found in the upper righthand corner of the product packaging, as shown by the green rectangle in this photo shared by Acme Smoked Fish Corp.\n\nThe recall was initiated voluntarily in October by Acme Smoked Fish Corp., a company that provides smoked salmon to Costco under the warehouse store\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment on the Jan. 22 classification update.\n\nIn its initial Oct. 22 letter to Costco members, Acme Smoked Fish Corp. said it was issuing the recall \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause a listeriosis infection, with symptoms that may include fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.\n\nListeriosis is often not dangerous for people with healthy immune systems, but it can be dangerous or life-threatening for pregnant people, individuals over 65, or people with weakened immune systems, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nCheck your products for the recall\n\nThe Costco smoked salmon recall only affects packages of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon with the lot number 8512801270. The lot number can be found on the front of the package above the \u201cBest By\u201d date.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. says customers who have purchased smoked salmon with the above lot number should not consume the products, and should return the products to Costco for a refund.\n\nThe company also advised consumers to call Acme Smoked Fish Corp. at 718-383-8585 with any questions or concerns.\n\nThis recall comes after Costco also recalled certain chicken products over listeria concerns in October 2024. Those recalls were part of a wider recall of ready-to-eat poultry that affected certain products sold at stores nationwide, including Aldi, Walmart, Target, Giant Eagle, HEB, Trader Joe\u2019s and Kroger.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

            "content": "Investors aren't fans of uncertainty. And there has been a lot of uncertainty rattling the market in the past couple of weeks, mainly related to the tariff announcements made by the new Trump administration. As a result, the S&P 500 trades around 9% off its peak from February (as of March 18).\n\nEven some of the best businesses haven't been spared. Just look at Costco Wholesale (COST -0.98%), whose shares have generated a wonderful 224% total return just in the past five years. This top retail stock is 16% below its record, which was established in February.\n\nI'm sure investors are looking at Costco as a potential buy-the-dip candidate right now. But can the membership-only warehouse club help make you a millionaire?\n\nDriving comps growth\n\nOne of the most important metrics for any retail enterprise is same-store sales (comps) growth. Companies that can consistently grow this figure, which measures the rise in revenue from stores typically open at least 12 months, are doing something right by boosting the productivity of each individual location by a combination of increased foot traffic and higher ticket amount.\n\nHere's where Costco stands out. For its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Feb. 16), the business reported a comps increase of 6.8%. This continues a long-running streak of comps growth.\n\nOver the past five years, a period that included the onset and depths of the pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and the current uncertain economy, Costco's comps kept increasing.\n\nDriving regular comps growth has propelled profit gains as well. In the past decade, the company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased at a compound yearly rate of 11.5%. And between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027, Wall Street analysts believe EPS will rise at the same annualized pace of 11.5%.\n\nMinimal threat of disruption\n\nCostco has made for a great investment in the past because the business proved to be durable. In other words, it's positioned so well that investors don't really need to worry about it being disrupted anytime soon.\n\nThe company's scale is key to its success. It reported $62.5 billion in net sales in the second quarter, making it the third biggest retailer on the planet. And the average Costco warehouse carries about 4,000 stock-keeping units, significantly less than typical supermarkets. As a result, the company has a huge advantage when buying merchandise from its vendors because it can obtain favorable pricing.\n\nThose cost savings are transferred to its members with every-day low prices, and they love this deal. Costco ended the second quarter with 78.4 million membership households. That was up 6.8% year over year, with a renewal rate of 93% in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIt's probably not difficult to figure out what might be one of Costco's top rivals: Amazon and its popular Prime membership. But despite the tech juggernaut's unbelievable success over the past decade, Costco has continued to grow its membership base, revenue, and EPS on a consistent basis, demonstrating it's a consumer favorite and that in-person shopping isn't going anywhere.\n\nShould you buy Costco stock?\n\nHad you invested $33,000 in Costco exactly 20 years ago, you would be sitting on a $1 million portfolio balance right now. Investors are probably wondering if buying the stock today on the dip can set them up for a similar outcome in the future.\n\nI'm not confident that history is going to repeat itself. Costco shares trade at a very expensive valuation: a price-to-earnings ratio of 52.6.

When an item disappears that you enjoy it can be disappointing. It can cause you to no longer visit the place, or perhaps you find something new that you have never tried. It can be heartbreaking to think of a food item you enjoy, knowing you may likely never taste it again when it goes away, but sometimes luck is on your side, and that item returns. Costco has recently announced that they are bringing back an item they got rid of years ago, and customers are excited to see it return.\n\nCostco Bringing Back Hot Turkey and Provolone Sandwich in ID, WA, and UT\n\nCredit: Marcus Reubenstein on Unsplash Credit: Marcus Reubenstein on Unsplash loading...\n\nWith items having left the food court recently at Costco, it is nice to see an item returning that left years ago. During the pandemic a few years back, Costco waved goodbye to the hot turkey and provolone sandwich from their menu. After a few years away, the sandwich is returning to the menu and will be available in Idaho, Washington, and Utah soon. The sandwich will cost $6.99 and be 820 calories. It will consist of sliced turkey breast, provolone cheese, red onions, tomatoes, and mayonnaise, all on a toasted roll. For more on the sandwich returning, you can click on the link above.\n\nCostco Changes in Idaho, Washington, and Idaho\n\nCredit: Marques Thomas on Unsplash Credit: Marques Thomas on Unsplash loading...\n\nCostco has been making many changes recently and some of the changes have been welcomed with fanfare and others have been met with disappointment. One of the most egregious changes recently was when the muffin recipe got changed and the muffins were downsized, but that wasn't the only change to take place. Kirkland chocolate chips will no longer be sold at Costco, and there have also been changes made to the food court. Costco will transition from Pepsi to Coke this year, as well as do away with the roast beef sandwich and the churro. With them bringing back the hot turkey and provolone sandwiche there is a chance that both items could return in the future as well.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nThe next time you visit Costco and decide to eat in the food court, you might have a new option to choose from. It will soon be back on the menu, and there is nothing wrong with having more food options. If you never had the chance to try the hot turkey and provolone sandwich the first time around, now is your chance.\n\nUpdates Coming to Costco Membership Prices How do you feel about these changes?

If you think that's expensive, just be thankful Costco is selling it at all\u2014the Of course, you can always buy some already made, but if you want to DIY it, and can't get your hands on the Costco pistachio spread IRL (some customers reported that it wasn't sold in their area), try this for $16.

But I think it\u2019s more that there is no punishment for these children.\u201d\n\nWegmans and Walmart pay RPD to have a marked car in their parking lots on East and Hudson Avenues at a rate of $107 per hour per officer. RPD says it does not have a request from Costco for that security, and not every request is granted.\n\nRPD reports zero stolen cars at the East Ave Wegmans over the last three years. Costco has not replied to News10NBC\u2019s email asking if it\u2019s considering more security.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the RPD\u2019s crime portal shows a spike in stolen cars in 2023, averaging 26 per week.

What the membership club isn't known for, though, is opening at the crack of dawn.\n\nCostco's warehouses open much later than traditional supermarkets\u2014maybe even later than your local Sam's Club if you have a Plus membership\u2014and many shoppers wonder why. Though we'd love to get in the door before 10 a.m., we finally know why Costco opens later than most stores. It comes down to keeping employees happy, meeting demand, and lowering operational costs.\n\n\u201cThe short answer is because it just works the best,\u201d Jack Jones, a Costco auditor, told Readers Digest. \u201cNothing Costco does is by accident\u2014all of these decisions have been studied and planned out to the last detail.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, there isn't that much demand early in the day. \u201cWe do what\u2019s called a \u2018door count\u2019 every half hour, and that shows us when people are coming into our warehouse,\u201d Jones explains. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t first thing in the morning.\u201d\n\nStore employees also need time to get ready for the day, and that starts much earlier than you might imagine.\n\n\u201cTrucks start arriving around 4 a.m., so we have employees that start between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. each day,\u201d another Costco auditor, Mary Smith, explained to Readers Digest. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot we have to do before the doors open. The time before opening is a lot of controlled chaos!\u201d\n\nSo starting the day earlier might benefit a few customers, but not so much the employees.\n\n\u201cOne of our core values, stated in our mission statement, is taking care of employees,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThis means ensuring they can have a regular schedule and a healthy work-life balance.\u201d\n\nSmith and Jones did let the eager beaver shoppers in on a secret, though: the 9:45 a.m. \"soft open.\" Many Costco warehouses will let you in the door a few minutes early if you're waiting outside. And now you know.\n\n\n\nRead the original article on Southern Living",

Treats \u2013 a giant bag of Pirate's Booty, trail mix, peanut M&Ms \u2013 while I loved them all weren't, to say the least, 100% necessary. There was one thing I wasn't willing to give up, though: Kirkland Signature Parmigiano Reggiano.\n\nWe use a lot of Parmesan. From easy weeknight pasta with red sauce topped with a mound of freshly grated cheese, to creamy asparagus soup and crispy Parmesan croutons, to decadent baked chicken Parmesan, it's truly in heavy rotation in our house.\n\nMaribeth Jones for Country Living\n\nWhy I Love It So Much\n\nFor two reasons. First, the price is spectacular! At about $0.78 per ounce versus $1.70 per ounce at other major grocery stores, the price simply can't be beat. And in specialty markets, the price can be even higher.\n\nSecondly, the quality is excellent. Often referred to as \"the king of cheeses,\" true Parmigiano Reggiano is produced in the Parma and Reggio Emilia regions of Italy. The cheese was first made during the Middle Ages by monks who desired a cheese that had a long shelf life. Parmigiano Reggiano quality and production standards are monitored by an Italian organization named the Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano and also fall under the DOP (meaning Denominazione di Origine Protetta, literally \"Protected Designation of Origin\") regulations that are overseen by the European Union.\n\nCostco's cheese has the mark of both of these organizations on the label, indicating its level of quality. This cheese also has all the attributes you want in a good Parmigiano Reggiano \u2013 dense and crumbly with the telltale crunchy amino acid crystals, and the flavor is fruity, slightly sweet and nutty all at the same time.\n\nWhile there are cheeses that are labeled Parmesan or Parmezan, these do not fall under the strict regulatory guidelines and thus are often of inferior quality.\n\nHow to Store It\n\nThe one downside, though I don't see it that way, is that the wedges at Costco typically weigh around 2 pounds each. Open cheese will last for about two months in the fridge, so if one can't get through it that quickly, it's still important to store it properly. The best way is to wrap the cheese in wax or parchment paper, then in aluminum foil. Avoid plastic wrap as it can hold in too much moisture, causing the cheese to mold. A shout out to my friends and coworkers who keep me well stocked in Costco Parmigiano Reggiano!!\n\n",

After all, it's Costco, right?\n\nCostco is committed to the $4.99 price point as a loss leader as Business Week reports to lure customers and the formula has made Kirkland Signature rotisserie chicken the top seller in the U.S. at 137 million chickens sold (in 2023)\n\nAnd yes, the chickens are very young, raised quickly to maximize production and keep the supply chain moving to meet demand and the $4.99 price point.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nUsing vertical integration, the company produces broiler chickens that are bred for consumption after less than seven weeks and weighing about five pounds according to industry watchdogs. A century ago, chickens were raised for 16 weeks and weighed just 2.5 pounds before they were ready for commercial production.\n\nCostco rotisserie chicken is sold on the shelf at 3 pounds and is larger than you will find at Safeway or Walmart for instance. The company says its product is larger as a result of hybrid breeding techniques and is not raised with hormones which is not permitted under U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations.\n\nI still enjoy a rotisserie chicken from Costco now and then and the decision to consume animal products based on their welfare and conditions they are raised under during commercial production remains an individual's choice to make.\n\nUpdates Coming to Costco Membership Prices How do you feel about these changes?

The store tells us what to buy, and we listen.\n\nOn my most recent Costco run, it was the apple berry pie that whispered to me from the bakery section. As a longtime fan of Costco\u2019s apple pie, I knew I had to try this fun, new spin on a classic. I\u2019d deal with how my two-person household would manage to consume it later. Maybe I\u2019d throw a party?\n\nWith a filling of apples and mixed berries, Costco\u2019s new apple berry pie is essentially the iconic apple pie dressed up for spring. It also features a delicious and beautiful lattice crust, which I\u2019m a total sucker for. For just $15.99, it was coming with me.\n\nMeghan Overdeep\n\nCostco rarely misses on a pie crust, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had nailed it once again. The crust is sweet and soft and somehow both crumbly and doughy. As far as the flavor of the filling goes, it reminds me a lot of strawberry rhubarb, another springtime staple. Raspberries and strawberries lend tartness to the apple and give it a vibrant red hue. There aren't too many seeds in it either, which can sometimes be the case with berry pies. Overall, it\u2019s sweet, but not too sweet.\n\nCostco fans are singing the new pie\u2019s praises over on Reddit. One user gave it an eight out of 10, writing: \u201cDefinitely worth trying, especially if you warm it up and pair it with the Kirkland vanilla ice cream. Can\u2019t go wrong for pie lovers\u201d\n\nMy husband, who isn\u2019t the biggest fan of fruit pies, liked the crust so much that he has been pulling it off to snack on when I\u2019m not looking. I really enjoyed it, but I\u2019ve never met a fruit pie that didn\u2019t have me seeing stars. Given its size, however, I\u2019m unlikely to purchase it again without having somewhere to bring it. Or heck, maybe I will throw that party.\n\nCostco\u2019s new apple berry pie has been available in stores for the past couple of weeks. It\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s a seasonal spring item or if it will stick around through summer, so grab one while you can!\n\n",

Straight Arrow News\n\nJust in time for road-trip season in California, Costco has given shoppers another reason to visit the nation's favorite superstore.\n\nAfter a social media teaser in February, Costco has announced that hours have been extended at its gas station locations.\n\nNow, Costco members have an additional hour on weekdays and an extra hour and a half on weekends to fill up at the pump.\n\nThe new hours are Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday 6 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., according to a Costco Facebook post.\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company\u2019s March 6 earnings call that Costco \"extended our gas station hours in North America during the quarter to make filling up at Costco more convenient for our members,\" according to FOX Business, and while the company will look at warehouse hours, there are no plans to change warehouse hours currently.\n\nCostco advises shoppers on its website there \"may be slight variations in hours for each warehouse\" and to view location information for a warehouse using their Find a Warehouse tool, which will also display any adjusted holiday hours and closures.\n\nWhere are Costco gas stations in California?\n\nAccording to Costco's website, there are 140 stores in California. San Jose has six Costcos, the most of any city in California. Wyoming, West Virginia, and Rhode Island are the states without Costco locations. In total, Costco has 614 stores in the United States.\n\nHave gas prices gone down in California?\n\nThe average gas price in California is $4.65 a gallon as of Wednesday, according to AAA Fuel Prices. That\u2019s several cents down from last week\u2019s average and about 20 cents down from the average cost of gas from one month ago.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a dollar and 55 cents higher than the national average as of Wednesday, said AAA Fuel Prices.\n\nMike Snider contributed to this report.",

For Costco, the big-box store corporation saw an increase of 7.7 million visits.\n\nThe decline in Target\u2019s traffic may reflect its decision to switch things up on customers. One-third of survey respondents knew about the Feb. 28 economic blackout. \u201cThat kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that\u2019s what gets brands like Target in trouble,\u201d said Collage Group\u2019s chief insights officer, David Albert, according to Business Insider. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen here, especially with Target, is that they\u2019ve eroded that trust.\u201d\n\nTarget announced its decision to roll back its DEI initiatives on Jan. 24, BLACK ENTERPRISE previously noted, after President Donald Trump\u2019s order following his inauguration to cease DEI programs. According to a companywide memo, the retail giant stated the changes would better align with the Target consumer base. The retail giant has faced boycotts due to its recent decision. During a Jan. 30 news conference, civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong stood outside the retailer\u2019s Minnesota headquarters and called for a nationwide boycott to begin on the first day of Black History Month. Keeping the momentum, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant announced a 40-day fast from Target, which commenced on March 5. In a press release obtained by BE, the pastor urged 100,000 Black shoppers to \u201chalt all purchases\u201d and \u201cdivest any stock holdings\u201d in the company.\n\nCostco, on the other hand, has stood firm on its DEI commitments. \u201cOur commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d the wholesaler\u2019s board wrote in a memo, per The Independent.

A few still took their chance to chide Costco for replacing their beloved churros with chocolate chip cookies.\n\nCostco\u2019s gas is usually priced lower than traditional gas stations.

In Los Angeles County, gas prices at Costco were $3.89 to $4.09 in coastal cities.\n\nMobil and Shell prices near those Costcos were selling regular gas from $4.20 up to $4.79 (and higher).

Shoppers offer ways you can skip entry scanners\n\nCostco operates 897 warehouses worldwide. It has 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, and 41 in Mexico. Its newest stores in the U.S. include one in Brentwood and the other in Highland.\n\nThe retailer recently completed a new contract with unionized employees.\n\nAccording to an earnings call March 6, the labor agreement includes an immediate $1 hourly wage increase for the company\u2019s \u201ctop of scale\u201d clerks, followed by an additional $1 increase in March 2026 and another in March 2027.\n\nThe company\u2019s entry-level clerks got a $0.50 hourly bump, taking Costco\u2019s minimum wage across the U.S. to $20 hourly.\n\nCostco\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer Ron Vachris said the average pay for its clerks in the U.S. and Canada is now just over $31 hourly.\n\nIf you have questions or tips about Costco, email Samantha Gowen at sgowen@scng.com.",

The warehouse has so many options for pre-installed, surprisingly stylish sheds that can easily turn into in-law suites, right in your own backyard. We've spotted everything from the Solitude Shed we'd use as a solo escape, to the Titan Shed with sprawling space for bigger families. Our latest find is the cutest one yet: the \"Pinnacle Shed,\" with unique features that make it feel a bit more residential.\n\nHandy Home Products Windemere 10x12 Do-it-Yourself Wooden Storage Shed with Floor $3,509 at Wayfair\n\nIf you want to avoid having a run-down shed as an eyesore on your property, the Pinnacle's frame is the right place to start. Costco's Pinnacle Shed comes from the Gorilla Sheds line, also home to the viral Goliath two-story barn. It's sturdy enough to stand up to 115 mph winds, comes with its own flooring, and the roof is weatherproof. You could always just use it as extra storage, but between the split-roof design, clerestory windows, it's primed to be a backyard getaway. Three extra operable windows will keep it well-ventilated, so it feels more like a relaxing room and less like a stuffy shed.\n\nThink carefully about the way you paint this shed. With the right color, it could actually be an ultra-trendy addition to your house. The example on Costco's site has an earthy green tone, this is one of the most popular front door colors of 2025, according to designers. But any paint choice can add to your home's aesthetic, emphasizing a natural flow between indoor and outdoor spaces.\n\nIf you ask us, and several real estate experts, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) will be sticking around for a while. They can add up to 34 percent in your home's value, so if you want to invest in its sellability, an ADU is a smart call. It also helps with aging in place. If you know your in-laws or relatives will want their own space or might move in with you, save yourself the future renovation headache.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram and .",

            "content": "Key Takeaways Costco's Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter is a more affordable alternative to Kerrygold.\n\nFor some shoppers, the butter even has a richer, creamier flavor, despite the lower price.\n\nThere's no doubt that Kerrygold butter is a top-notch butter product. If you aren't familiar, the Irish butter is made with milk from grass-fed cows giving it a deeper golden hue than traditional American butter and an arguably creamier mouthfeel. But this premium product also comes with a premium up-charge.\n\nI've personally found that everything I bake (especially cookies!) turns out so much better when I use Kerrygold rather than generic grocery store butter. So to save a buck, I've been stocking up on it at Costco where I can get four gold bars (the equivalent of eight sticks of American butter) for just $16.95\u2014saving a few dollars compared to my local grocery store in the process.\n\nBut that all changed when I found an alternate on the shelf next to the Kerrygold at Costco: Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter. It even comes in a shiny box similar to that of the Kerrygold packaging, signaling to me that this is Costco's house brand version of the popular butter.\n\nHow Does Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter Compare to Kerrygold Butter?\n\nDevon O'Brien/Allrecipes\n\nLike Kerrygold, the butter is made with milk from cows that (mostly) graze on grass year-round (the package does say the cows get about 5 percent of their diet from grains for nutritional balance). The nutrition labels even list the same amount of fat content, although it's also worth noting my generic grocery store butter also listed the same fat content despite Kerrygold's claim that its butter has a higher percentage of butterfat. The only butter I have found that lists a higher fat content on the nutrition label is the cultured butter I buy. The sodium content in the Kirkland brand is also slightly lower than Kerrygold. (Side note: the Kirkland version is currently only available in salted, whereas Kerrygold is available in salted and unsalted, so to keep the test fair I only compared the salted versions.) The other main difference: Kirkland's grass-fed butter hails from New Zealand, not Ireland, like Kerrygold.\n\nThe biggest difference between these premium butter offerings? The price. At my Costco the Kerrygold pack costs nearly $17, while the Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter costs only $11.69 for the same amount. That will save you over $1 per butter bar which, in this time of rising food costs, is a pretty big deal.\n\nThe bigger question, however, is whether it tastes as good as Kerrygold. And actually, I think it's better. The first thing you notice upon peeling back the foil is that the Kirkland grass-fed butter is an even deeper golden color than the Kerrygold butter (something I didn't think was even possible!). First, we tasted each butter on its own, without the packaging so we didn't know which butter was which, and all the tasters agreed that Kirkland's version had more butter flavor than Kerrygold.\n\nNext, I tried both butters out in a sugar cookie recipe. The butters both performed the same in terms of how they creamed, how the dough handled, and how the cookies baked up. So again, we tried each cookie anonymously (without knowing which one was made with which butter) and again, all tasters agreed that the cookie made with the Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed butter tasted more \"buttery\" than the Kerrygold butter.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile I still love Kerrygold, in the name of saving money, I'll be picking up Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter on my monthly butter run from now on.",

Both charge an annual membership fee to access the deals. Both were directly inspired by the visionary entrepreneur Sol Price's original club stores.\n\nHowever, digging a little deeper into consumer data reveals some notable differences between the two brands' customer profiles.\n\nFor starters, the typical Costco shopper spends nearly twice as much a year and visits more than 50% more frequently than Sam's Club members do, according to 2024 data from consumer analytics firm Numerator.\n\nThe typical Costco shopper visits about 32 times a year and spends a total of $3,086, while the typical Sam's Club shopper makes 20 trips and spends $1,583 in a year, according to Numerator.\n\nAs part of their overall retail budget, Costco shoppers spend roughly one in eight of their dollars at warehouse stores, which is almost 65% higher than the overall US average.\n\nThat wallet share is a bit lower for the typical Sam's Club member, who spends about one in 12 of their dollars at wholesale clubs \u2014 still higher than the US average by about 13%.\n\nCostco shoppers also tend to be wealthier \u2014 earning more than $125,000 household income on average \u2014 while Sam's Club shoppers tend to have more mid-range incomes of between $40,000 and $125,000. Even so, Sam's Club members are slightly more likely to be homeowners than Costco members, Numerator finds.\n\nAnd while both chains are unsurprisingly popular in the suburbs, Sam's Club is more popular among rural households and Costco has more strength with city dwellers, according to Numerator.\n\nThe data indicates that both chains tend to be equally popular among shoppers who identify as white. Walmart-owned Sam's Club is slightly favored by shoppers who identify as Black or Hispanic/Latino.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco is exceptionally popular among Asian-identifying households, who are nearly twice as likely to shop there as at a typical retail brand.\n\nCostco shoppers are also much more interested in organic foods than their Sam's Club counterparts.\n\nIn terms of age, Sam's Club shoppers skew slightly older than Costco shoppers, though Gen X shoppers are equal fans of both.\n\nKantar retail analyst Gina Logan told Business Insider that Gen Z and Alpha shoppers are increasingly seeing the appeal of the club store model, which could bring down the average customer age at both chains.\n\nAnd 2024 was a big year for Sam's Club that saw the rollout of new AI-powered checkout technology and the grand opening of its first new store in seven years.\n\nSam's Club also managed to snatch the top ranking for customer satisfaction in retail from longtime winner Costco earlier this year.\n\nLastly, both chains are seeing a strong start to 2025, with visits up more than 7% from last year \u2014 double the increases for Walmart and Target \u2014 according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.\n\nNumerator's data indicates nearly half of American households shop at either Costco or Sam's Club at least once in the past year, underscoring that US shoppers love finding a good deal.",

And if you happen to pop into Costco, you're likely to come across a frozen treat that customers can't seem to get enough of.\n\nAcross social media, Costco shoppers have been on the hunt for the somewhat elusive Chocolate Honeycomb Sandwich. The ice cream bar features caramel ice cream with sugar bits sandwiched between two Speculoos biscuits. Similar to another viral Costco ice cream sandwich, half of the bar is dipped in chocolate.\n\nIn a Reddit thread about the Chocolate Honeycomb Sandwich, users have described the dessert as \"incredible\" and have rated it an impressive 10 out of 10.\n\n\"Really sad my location dropped them quickly,\" said one person\n\n\"I wish my location had these they are 10/10,\" another user added.\n\nDespite the praise the ice cream bars have received, there were some critiques. One Costco shopper in particular pointed out that the cookie unfortunately doesn't cover the entire bar.\n\n\"When I bought these I thought the whole thing had the biscuit part and half was dipped in chocolate. But it\u2019s half chocolate and half biscuit,\" they wrote.\n\nOthers would have preferred a biscuit that was \"a little crunchier,\" while some weren't a fan of the cinnamon flavor.\n\nThere were also several comments about some Costco locations dropping the ice cream bars not long after they were made available, so be sure to act fast if you spot a box!\n\nYou Might Also Like",

The spicy poke ahi tuna is yet another addition to its rotation of delicious and convenient protein choices. The spicy ahi tuna is cubed fresh tuna tossed in a mayo-based spicy poke sauce and sold without any additional sides, so you'll want to pair it with either rice, noodles, nori, or some other kind of base to make a meal of it. It's topped with red tobiko, or flying fish roe, and scallions for a little texture and additional seasoning. The spicy ahi tuna is not a staple item, so you'll have to keep an eye out for it in your local Costco's refrigerated deli section.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to get your hands on this rare Costco item, you're in for a treat. Reviewers across Reddit and grocery blogs have positive things to say about the flavor and portion size of the tuna. If there is one complaint, there seems to be a general consensus that there are some bits of tuna that are too chewy or gristly. That's somewhat understandable, given that Costco is a grocery warehouse and not a fish market. But with an average price of around $20 a pound (it varies by region and store), sacrificing perfect texture to get your poke fix is a fair trade.",

Leagues ahead of those canned peaches. The syrup is not cloyingly sweet or thick and you can just straight up add some ice and water to get a nice drink out of it.

I haven't seen these at Costco in months and I need them to come back! I'm on a diet and these were a total game changer.

            "content": "Safe to say my first Costco trip was a real experience\u2026 (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nCall me boring if you want, but I love a good supermarket shop.\n\nTake me to big Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s and I\u2019ll be in my element looking at homeware and cute pyjamas that I don\u2019t really need, before stocking up on my favourite snacks. Simple pleasures and all that.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise then, that going to Costco for the first time ever would be a big deal for me.\n\nStanding outside the warehouse in Hayes, I was giddy with excitement. It wasn\u2019t quite on par with the way a child feels at Disneyland for the first time, but it was up there.\n\nThe wholesale chain has pretty strict membership criteria and I\u2019d never previously met the requirements to get in. But thanks to my husband switching jobs, that had all changed.\n\nFinally armed with my very own Costco card I headed inside the store\u2026 and was met with utter chaos.\n\nI never knew what I was going to find\u2026 (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to Costco before, it\u2019s my duty to warn you never to go on a weekend \u2013 it\u2019s akin to being in London when the Christmas lights are switched on, or at a UK beach in the height of summer. There were people absolutely everywhere and endless queues, both to get into the store and for the checkouts. It isn\u2019t for the weak.\n\nThe layout of the shop itself was also rather chaotic, although this is definitely part of the experience. I never knew what I was going to find from one moment to the next \u2013 there were sports bras on a shelf next to blenders, and children\u2019s toys near power tools.\n\nWhile I was busy adapting all of this, my husband, who usually hates any form of grocery shopping, was having a blast. According to him it\u2019s because the warehouse set up feels remarkably like being in a B&Q, thanks to the really tall shelving, as well as the drills and furniture for sale.\n\nThe warehouse layout reminded my husband of B&Q or Homebase (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nWe quickly realised we\u2019d never be able to do a proper grocery shop here. Everything is sold in bulk, which is ideal if you\u2019re running a business or feeding a large family, but rather unnecessary for just the two of us, as there\u2019d be too much waste.\n\nThat said, there were some store cupboard essentials, that would not only last for ages, but proved to be better value when bought this way.\n\nFor instance, a 600g tub of Marmite cost us \u00a35.99 at Costco, while a 250g jar is \u00a33 at Sainsbury\u2019s (our nearest shop). Similarly, Twinings English Breakfast Tea Bags are \u00a34.80 for 80 bags at Sainsbury\u2019s, but \u00a37.99 for 300 bags in Costco.\n\nStore cupboard essentials can be cheaper to buy like this from Costco (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just kitchen staples, there were more bargains to be found in the toiletries section, with a 96 pack of Tampax Pearl Compak costing \u00a311.99. In comparison, a 16 pack is \u00a33.25 at Sainsbury\u2019s. You do the math.\n\nFor the Micellar Water girlies, this is also notably cheaper to buy at Costco, with a two-pack of 700ml Garnier bottles costing \u00a38.49 \u2013 at Boots, one 700ml bottle is \u00a39.99.\n\nNot everything was necessarily good value for money though, especially products in the bakery section. A 12 pack of croissants was priced at \u00a35.49, whereas 12 croissants in Sainsbury\u2019s work out at \u00a33.20.\n\nI also audibly gasped when I saw that a six-pack of chocolate muffins was going for \u00a37.99, but thankfully a kind stranger pointed out the fine print on the label, which said you could get two packs for \u00a37.99. There were a few sneaky offers like this, so definitely worth keeping your eyes peeled to get the most bang for your buck.\n\nOutside of nabbing a bargain, you can get pretty much everything and anything from Costco, including an eye test for \u00a319.99 at the in-store opticians. Over the course of our two hour exploration of the store we also found a \u00a373,000 diamond ring (who is buying this from Costco?!), smutty fantasy books, and salvage palettes which contained everything from clothing, to nappies and washing machines.\n\nWho is spending \u00a373,000 on a ring at Costco?! (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nThere were two things that really surprised me during our visit though \u2013 one positive, the other not so much. We\u2019ll start with the negative.\n\nI was gobsmacked by how much money we spent, despite shopping pretty carefully. Our haul was mostly practical purchases like cereal, spaghetti, cheese, vegetables, condiments, and butter.\n\nWe\u2019d tried to limit the number of \u2018rogue\u2019 items we added in for the hell of it, although we did also take home a tub of pretzels bigger than my head, a pack of 36 Babybels and a tray of 24 of the viral cookies (sadly not worth the hype, too artificial tasting).\n\nOur total spend came to over \u00a3100, which is more than our weekly shop, and we had much less food to show for it. I was flabbergasted, and had immediate buyer\u2019s remorse. I pushed the trolley from the till to the food court by the exit in a bit of a daze.\n\nWe ended up spending over \u00a3100, and while most of it was practical, we couldn\u2019t resist a few impulse purchases (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nAfter all that shopping, we\u2019d definitely worked up an appetite so we ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, a hot dog and soda.\n\nLittle did we know that this pit stop at the back of the store would be the highlight of the whole visit.\n\nI was sceptical about the kind of food we\u2019d receive from what was essentially a hatch at the back of a warehouse, especially given that it was so cheap \u2013 \u00a31.50 for a hot dog and drink and \u00a31.99 for a slice of pizza \u2013 but the food really blew me away.\n\nThe food court was an unexpected surprise (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nThe pepperoni pizza was better than the likes of Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut or Papa John\u2019s. That\u2019s fighting talk, I know, but I\u2019m not the only one who thinks it. Reddit users agree, even going as far as to proclaim it the \u2018best takeaway pizza in the whole of the UK\u2019.\n\nI enjoyed it so much, I was already chomping away before I remembered to snap a quick pic for this article, hence the giant bite mark.\n\nMy husband felt similarly about the beef hot dog, which can be ordered with or without onions, and along with a soda of your choosing for less than \u00a32. He could have added in an ice cream as well and the price would still have put supermarket meal deals to shame.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more on the menu, including a chicken sandwich, jacket potato, chicken and bacon bake, gelato, plus those famous cookies, which can be bought individually \u2013 something I wish I\u2019d known before buying 24 of them.\n\nEverything was under \u00a35, except for whole pizzas which cost \u00a39.99, but in today\u2019s climate, that\u2019s still felt like a steal.\n\nA slice of pizza cost \u00a31.99 (Picture: Courtney Pochin)\n\nThe only downside was that there were only a handful of seats in the food court, and like the rest of the store it was heaving with people. Being too hungry to wait for a table, we tucked in there and then slumped over the handlebar of our trolley.\n\nThe pizza was messy and theawkward standing position made for one of the most undignified eating experiences of my life, but I enjoyed the meal none the less.\n\nWill I be going back to Costco again any time soon?\n\nI\u2019d go back for another slice of the pizza in a heartbeat, but I\u2019m no longer feeling the same levels of excitement about shopping there. But that\u2019s ok, because it\u2019s not really meant for me.\n\nIf I\u2019m ever planning a big dinner party it could be worth another visit, but otherwise I think I\u2019ll be sticking with Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco for now.\n\nDo you have a story to share?\n\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\nArrow MORE: Bakery chain \u2018superior to Greggs\u2019 confirms high street return after closing all stores\n\nArrow MORE: Nestl\u00e9\u2019s \u2018best ever\u2019 discontinued chocolate bar is finally back in UK shops\n\nArrow MORE: \u2018Top notch\u2019 supermarket hot cross buns revealed as best for Easter 2025",

Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nTrump's second term likely means changes for retailers.\n\nTariffs are top of mind for many companies and would represent new costs for consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, tax cuts may spur spending, and regulators could have a softer touch on mergers.\n\nDonald Trump's return to the White House is likely to usher in sweeping changes that affect retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Costco \u2014 from new tariffs to tax cuts and a new regulatory environment.\n\nTrump's campaign promises, as well as his first term, offer some insights into what major retailers can expect from his second term.\n\nIn the lead-up to Election Day, companies including Tractor Supply Co., Best Buy, and Dick's Sporting Goods said on their earnings calls that the presidential race contributed to a generally more cautious US consumer.\n\nHowever, the unambiguous election result may comfort retailers heading into the critical holiday shopping period.\n\n\"Elections are very distracting for the consumer,\" Neil Saunders, a GlobalData retail analyst, told Business Insider last week. \"It's not massively bad, but it's just not helpful for consumer confidence and the consumer attention.\"\n\nHe added: \"Retail wants really a clear victory \u2014 whichever way. Then they can understand the policies and how to react, and then the consumer can start focusing on the holidays and opening their wallets.\"\n\nWalmart, which operates thousands of stores in both red and blue states, was measured in its outlook in an August earnings call.\n\n\"Good thing about elections is they come along every four years and we get to have a lot of history with seeing the impact of that,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey said.\n\nWith Election Day in the rearview, here are four key areas that retailers are expected to watch closely during this transition period.\n\nTariffs are the biggest question\n\nTop of mind for many companies is the question of tariffs, experts said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his campaign proposals of 10% to 20% tariffs on most imports and 60% to 100% tariffs on goods from China, it would significantly change the way retailers do business.\n\n\"It would be a massive upheaval to most of the cost structures for these companies,\" Chris Walton, a former Target executive and cofounder of Omni Talk, said.\n\nGiven the expense of reorganizing supply chains, large retailers are still in the research phase, rather than committing to a new strategy, Walton said.\n\nWhile retailers may absorb some of the costs associated with tariffs, US households would likely lose up to $78 billion a year in spending power, found an analysis from the National Retail Federation, a lobby group representing the industry.\n\n\"A tariff is a tax paid by the US importer, not a foreign country or the exporter,\" Jonathan Gold, the NRF's vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said. \"This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"\n\nStill, Tinglong Dai, a Johns Hopkins University business professor, said the retail industry handled prior rounds of tariffs without too much disruption to prices and the flow of essential goods.\n\n\"Retailers have become incredibly adept at absorbing these frictions,\" he said.\n\nSaunders said of Trump's proposals: \"You can say it's a negotiating strategy and it won't actually come to pass, or you can say will come to pass, maybe in a diluted form and not that severe, but it's causing a lot of nervousness.\"\n\nTaxes matter, but it takes time to see results\n\nTrump is expected to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire next year. He's also likely to cut corporate taxes further, backed by his supporters in the House and Senate.\n\nSaunders said tax cuts would lead to more disposable income for consumers, which could lift spending.\n\n\"The whole of retail is very dependent on the middle class and what you can eke out of their spending levels,\" he said.\n\nAny changes to the tax code are likely to be less disruptive than tariffs since they would take many months to flow through the economy.\n\nPlus, Walton said, retailers routinely manage tax changes at every level of government, from local to national.\n\n\"What's different,\" he added, \"is this is of a size and scope that the retail industry hasn't seen in 100 years.\"\n\nImmigration presents a mix of challenges\n\nPast studies from the Pew Research Center suggested relatively few of the retail industry's 15 million employees lived in the US illegally, so a crackdown on illegal immigration likely wouldn't complicate retailers' hiring efforts.\n\nStill, a widespread deportation effort could negatively affect people throughout the industry, as well as consumers and communities.\n\n\"Everyone's going to feel the brunt of that,\" Walton said. \"If that were to happen, it's a tough thing to prepare for because the collateral damage from it could be pretty expensive.\"\n\nA more pressing concern, Saunders said, is a tightening of legal immigration, including through the H-1B visa program for skilled workers. Giants such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target increasingly rely on tech workers that obtain those visas.\n\n\"That's actually very unhelpful for a lot of retailers, especially in areas like technology, which a lot of retailers are involved,\" he said.\n\nOther experts told BI that concerns over national security and the availability of workers are far different compared with eight years ago, which could persuade Trump to soften his position.\n\nRegulation down, deals up\n\nSaunders said Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission's chief who has launched investigations into corporate price gouging, is likely to be one of the first to go under the new Trump administration.\n\nIn place of her aggressive antitrust posture, he added, a more deal-friendly FTC is likely to emerge.\n\nMergers like the one proposed between Kroger and Albertsons could find a more receptive audience in Washington, and other consolidations may soon follow.\n\nWhile a Republican administration is usually considered more business-friendly, Walton said it might not always be so straightforward under Trump.\n\n\"It can wax and wane to whatever the flavor of the month is in terms of where his administration wants to focus or who he wants to benefit,\" he said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Retailers like Costco and Trader Joe\u2019s are capping the number of cartons each shopper can buy. Some Americans are reporting that eggs in their local stores are selling out within 10 minutes of becoming available.\n\nWith indications that the egg shortage is likely to continue and even worsen, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently offered a solution on Fox News: Americans might consider raising chickens in their backyards\u2014a suggestion she was roundly mocked for, with the HuffPost describing it as \u201cclucked-up.\u201d\n\nDid her advice sound a little apocalyptic?

Robin Jerstad / Contributor\n\nNews broke this week that the United States Department of Agriculture halted $1 billion in federal spending, which included two programs that facilitate the purchasing of food from local farms and food manufactures for schools and food banks.\n\nThe USDA has not formally announced the spending cuts at the time of writing, but Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller addressed the cuts on Thursday, March 13, citing that \"even well-functioning programs that deliver real results are undergoing reviews to ensure fairness.\" The San Antonio Food Bank confirmed to MySA the impacts to its organization that serves 29 Texas counties and supports 100 Texas-based farms and businesses through the grant program.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe two programs are the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFS) and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), both of which the USDA has said in the past Texas was a participant in. There are 20 food banks in the state of Texas.\n\n\"These changes also provide an opportunity for states to assume greater responsibility in shaping their own programs,\" Miller said in the statement. \"Texas and the Texas Department of Agriculture do not depend on this funding to maintain a strong program. We\u2019ve been at the forefront for years, developing sustainable initiatives. Texas will continue to effectively operate successful Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs.\"\n\nMiller cites that \"$257.8 million was spent by Texas schools on local foods,\" but it is not immediately clear what timeframe that figure includes and where the funds that schools used were allocated from.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nLFS funds can be used to pay for the direct purchase, transportation, and storage of unprocessed or minimally processed foods where purchases are made with producers and small businesses or through distributors, according to the Texas Department of Agriculture's website. The LFPA aimed to \"support small and underserved producers to increase the number of products distributed to underserved communities in the state.\"\n\nAccording to CEO Eric Cooper, the San Antonio Food Bank coordinates with between 110 and 120 farmers and food manufacturers via the LFPA program that are impacted due to the cuts. The impact on Texas schools from the LFS cuts are not immediately known.\n\nThe San Antonio Food Bank serves 105,000 people per week across 29 southwest Texas counties. Cooper said that all 20 food banks across the Lone Star State work together to serve the needs of Texans by helping stock food pantries in small towns and serving families through mobile distributions.\n\nCooper explained that, through LFPA, they received two of the three rounds of funding from the current agreement, that covered purchases in 2023 and 2024, though the processes around what is happening with the third round of funding have been complicated.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"It's probably caught in the semantics of 'did the funding just end? or 'was the funding cut?\" Cooper said. \"There were dollar set aside for this initiative and those dollars are not going to be directed in the way that we perceived and so 100 percent we believe that we are not getting that funding at the current strategy or program. But we know that rural Texas has a huge need, and farmers are struggling. Something will need to be done to accommodate that need.\"\n\nCooper said the food bank had purchase agreements in place with more than 100 Texas farms and food manufacturers tied to the program, which provided them with approximately $3 million last year.\n\n\"At this time, any future funding is contingent on federal appropriations,\" the Texas Department of Agriculture said in a statement to MySA. \"There will be initial gaps created by the lack of funding, but there are other opportunities to explore either through state or private sponsorship to make up the difference or at least come closer to it.\"\n\nOne such program, the state agency pointed out, is the Texas Surplus Agricultural Grant Program which was established in 2022 that was created to to provide funding for collecting and distributing surplus agricultural products to food banks and other charitable organizations that serve needy or low-income individuals.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nCooper said that, in a year's time, the food bank will distribute about $180 million in food to southwest Texas. For now though, the San Antonio Food Bank is taking it in stride and remaining optimistic that an improved system could be on its way.\n\n\"I think the No. 1 strategy for adapting is optimism that the federal government will continue to do something. It might look different, it might have some targeted focus or requirements or efficiencies, but the need for strengthening American farmers and feeding food insecure households will continue,\" he said said.\n\nCooper noted the food bank currently has \"enough food to meet demand\" to continue serving its clients, and said that the organization will rely more on private donors for food and funding donations amid the changes.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

I've got several shopping hacks to share with you.\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n>\n\n(By the way, if you recognize this gif, then we are now friends, ha!)\n\nI used to live alone so I didn't cook that much and didn't need to buy stuff in \"bulk.\" Then I had a baby, and I was suddenly thrust into BabyDiaperland. Money was pretty tight, so I decided to get myself a membership and make \"Costco Runs\" like my friends.\n\nI only bought two things in bulk that year with my Costco membership: baby diapers and cans of tuna.\n\nNow my \"baby\" just turned 14 years old. I let my membership lapse, so it's safe to say I haven't set foot in a Costco since 2012!\n\nCostco Membership: Does it REALLY have its perks?\n\nI really like shopping at WinCo. It gives me that Costco feel without the membership card. Score! The turning point for me was when I went to a friend's party last month and they had desserts that you can only get at Costco. I finally bit the bullet and renewed my membership.\n\nOne visit down since then, and I just have to say, I had truly forgotten what it is like to shop in a Costco. There's still a bunch of people everywhere and the shopping carts are so HUGE. Thankfully, they still offer free samples of food!\n\nA lot has changed since I was last inside of a Costco: I was floored to find out they FINALLY have self-checkout lanes for those of us only buying a couple of items! Where was this option when I needed it fourteen years ago?!\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nIf you live in Washington and you're renewing your membership like me or are getting one for the very first time, here are six Costco hacks I wish I had known a long time ago.\n\nCOSTCO HACK #1\n\nNotice a price dropped on something you bought at Costco? Get free \"Price Adjustments\" within 30 days of the date of your purchase.\n\nDo You Know About These Washington Costco Hacks? Paula Bronstein Getty Images loading...\n\nCOSTCO HACK #2\n\nSave $$ on pricey car repairs: All Costco members (Gold Star, Business and Executive) can ask for a 15% discount on parts and services at their auto center no matter where their car was bought. (The 15% offer is good only up to $500.)\n\nCostco Profits Rise In Weak Economy Tim Boyle/Getty Images loading...\n\nCOSTCO HACK #3\n\nAn asterisk beside the price means it is about to be discontinued (so if you can, I'd suggest you stock up on it if you like it)! There are also meanings behind some of those prices (like prices ending in \"9\", items with an asterisk \"*\", and so forth). This article from the FW explains it in better detail than I can.\n\nSome Costco Prices Have Hidden Meanings Tim Boyle/Getty Images loading...\n\nHold on, there's still three more hacks left (and the best one is at the end)!\n\nCOSTCO HACK #4\n\nSame Day Deliveries: Love Costco but don't like to be around crowds or stand in line?

Revenue of $62.15 billion also beat expectations of $61.98 billion.\n\n\"Our members are willing to spend as inflation comes down\" as long as there's \"newness of items, quality, and value,\" CFO Gary Millerchip said on its earnings call.\n\nSame-store sales, excluding fuel, grew 7.2% in the quarter, boosted by its US business, followed by international and then Canada.\n\nFoot traffic, up 5.1%, missed the 6.87% jump Wall Street hoped for, but ticket size grew 0.1%, besting the 0.40% decline the Street predicted.\n\nMillerchip added there's a \"bifurcation\" among consumers when it comes to food shopping with some buying higher-priced meats, while others going for lower priced items like poultry, some cuts of beef and pork.\n\nCostco shares are flat Thursday after the results. Year to date, its stock is up over 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nThe earnings rundown:\n\nHere's what Costco reported for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nRevenue: $62.15 billion versus $61.98 billion\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $4.04 versus $3.81\n\nTotal company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 7.2% versus 6.26%\n\nUS same-store sales growth: 7.2% versus 6.14%\n\nCanada same-store sales growth: 6.7 % versus 5.68%\n\nOther international sales growth: 7.1% versus 7.08%\n\nE-commerce growth: 13.2% versus 14.1%\n\nMembership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.17 billion\n\nPotential tariffs under President-elect Donald Trump are catching the eyes of management. It's \"difficult for anyone to predict\" due to \"uncertainty around the timing and scope of changes,\" said Millerchip, calling tariffs \"not something that we see as a positive in general.\"\n\n\"We believe that our merchants and buyers are equipped ... [to] work through and navigate and manage that situation,\" he said.\n\nA few options include pulling forward inventory buying, working with vendors to mitigate costs, considering alternative sourcing locations, or reconsidering which items to sell.\n\nA quarter of Costco's business is non-food items that will be affected, though only a \"subset\" of that category is imported.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. This was the first full quarter since the price hike.\n\nMembership fee income grew 7.8% to $1.17 billion, compared to the $1.08 billion reported last year.\n\nThe company hadn't raised its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned.\n\nIn the first quarter, renewal rates reached 90.4%. In total, there are 138.8 million cardholders, a 7.2% increase year over year.\n\nCostco operates 897 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter, up from 891 last quarter. Vachris said he expects roughly 30 warehouses to open per year, with a \"good portion, not quite half\" outside the US.\n\nIts e-commerce business grew 13.2% but missed estimates of 14.1%.\n\nOnline sales were boosted by gold and jewelry, in addition to hardware, gift cards, home furniture, sporting goods, and health and beauty aids.\n\nFrom a year ago, the average value per online order grew 4% and site traffic grew 16%.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a \"Top Pick.\"\n\n\"We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum,\" he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise \"from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands.\"\n\nParikh said a stock split could be in the future. The stock is currently hovering around $1,000 per share.\n\nMillerchip said a stock split isn't in the plans currently. The \"ability now to buy fractional shares\" makes the argument for it \"a little bit less clear\" than in the past.\n\n\"We do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investors and employees who are very important constituents for us, so we'll continue to evaluate over time,\" he added.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

H John Voorhees III/Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nDANBURY \u2013 The Shops at Marcus Dairy retail plaza is looking to add Cava, a popular Mediterranean restaurant, to its mix of tenants on Sugar Hollow Road, according to city records.\n\nAttorney Neil Marcus, who represents The Shops at Marcus Dairy, submitted an application to change the use of a vacant space in the plaza\u2019s AT&T building from retail to \u201crestaurant without the sale of alcoholic beverages,\u201d according to a letter from Danbury Associate Planner Allie Smith.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nApproval of Marcus\u2019s application was \u201cgranted strictly for the proposed change in use,\u201d Smith stated in her letter, adding that any additional changes to the site layout would require a revised site plan application. Additionally, the restaurant should not exceed 29 seats, according to Smith\u2019s letter.\n\nMarcus\u2019 application called for a change in use to allow the restaurant Cava Mezze Grill, also known as Cava, to occupy 2,570 square feet of space in the AT&T building located in the front of the plaza near Backus Avenue, Smith stated in her letter. The proposed restaurant would require 14 parking spaces out of the shopping center\u2019s 411, according to Smith\u2019s letter to Marcus.\n\nThe city's Planning and Zoning Department approved the waiver for the change of use, Smith told Hearst Connecticut Media Group. The permit for a \"tenant fit-out\" at The Shops at Marcus Dairy is now under review by multiple departments, including the Zoning Department, Fire Marshal, Public Utilities and others, according to Tim Rosati, assistant director of permit coordination.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nCava, which offers a selection of Mediterranean bowls and pita meals as well as dips, drinks and desserts, has three Connecticut locations, in Westport, Greenwich and Newington.\n\nThe Shops at Marcus Dairy is already home to a variety of tenants across more than 79,000 square feet of space, including Whole Foods, Duluth Trading Co., AT&T and Sleep Number. It is located across the street from the Danbury Fair mall.\n\nWithin the past three months, it has experienced a few changes, with tenants expanding their sites or relocating to new spaces within the plaza. Interior construction is currently underway for the expansion of Petco into the plaza\u2019s former Panera space, according to Marcus. Completion is targeted over the next five months, though construction is \u201chard to predict,\u201d according to Marcus.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

            "content": "Costco Wholesale recently reported a strong second quarter earnings performance, with sales and revenue showing considerable year-over-year growth, yet this did not translate into positive shareholder returns over the last quarter as the company's stock dropped by 6.20%. Despite recording higher sales and net income for both the quarter and first half of the fiscal year, the impact of broader market trends cannot be ignored. During the same period, major stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite experienced significant declines, with market sentiment overshadowed by economic uncertainties and the effects of tariff concerns. Moreover, challenges such as labor negotiations and the retirement of its CFO might have contributed to investor caution, overshadowing otherwise strong financial growth. These factors together may have influenced the decreased share price, even as Costco demonstrated solid earnings performance.\n\nUnderstand the uncertainties surrounding Costco Wholesale's market positioning with our detailed risk analysis report.\n\nNasdaqGS:COST Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nCurious About Other Options? Diversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence.\n\nOver the last five years, Costco Wholesale shares have delivered a total return of 227.72%. This impressive performance is supported by consistent earnings growth, where profits have surged annually at a rate of 13.9%. Moreover, the company's earnings growth in the past year outpaced the Consumer Retailing industry average, demonstrating its competitive edge. Specifically, Costco's earnings growth of 12.3% last year significantly exceeded the industry growth of 3.6%. Despite trading at a high price-to-earnings ratio compared to industry and peer averages, Costco's robust return on equity of 29.8% highlights its strong financial foundation.\n\nAdding to the company's sustainable growth are recent announcements, such as the January 2025 vote by Costco Teamsters highlighting labor negotiations. Additionally, the launch of new products like Chef Jos\u00e9 Garces' Yucatan Chicken in Costco locations reflects the company's dedication to expanding its offerings and customer base. While challenges like executive changes may impact sentiment, Costco's capacity for delivering high-quality earnings remains evident.\n\nHold shares in Costco Wholesale?

It was the worst-kept secret.\u201d\n\nSherman said they have waited to make the announcement about Costco while final documents were signed to place the retail warehouse club store at the site of the mall. There is no immediate timeline on when construction will begin, but county officials have said they hope to begin demolishing the old mall soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been huge,\u201d Sherman said about the decision for Costco to come to the site. \u201cThe mall has been dilapidated for 11 years.\u201d\n\nThe two Republican commissioners highlighted the development during their \u201cstate of the county\u201d discussion during the all-day expo that brought commercial and residential experts to W&J College to discuss how to make Washington County thrive.\n\nSouth Strabane Township supervisors will consider an application from developer 79/70 Associates for a \u201cretail warehouse club\u201d at the current site of Washington Mall during a public hearing scheduled at 6 p.m. March 25. A Campers Inn RV center is already slated to be built on the property, while there are expected to be other retail shops built around the Costco store.\n\n\u201cKnocking down the mall, I think that\u2019s getting more shares on Facebook than anything else we do,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nDuring an earlier session discussing economic development, Tony Rosenberger of Chapman Properties, which is spearheading the redevelopment project at the old mall, discussed the need for community buy-in when it comes to economic opportunities that come with reimagining places like Washington Mall.\n\n\u201cThe lesson to the community is you have to invest,\u201d Rosenberger said. \u201cWithout investment in infrastructure, you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d\n\nBurns Scalo President Brian Walker, who was on the economic development panel with Rosenberger, said he has heard complaints from some in the community about the decision by the commissioners to use federal American Rescue Plan Act money to demolish the old Washington Mall. But he said that stimulus money funneled through the county\u2019s blight mitigation fund is a perfect use for it since it will create new development in a place that would otherwise remain stagnant.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been controversial (but) from an economic standpoint, numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat mall would keep sitting there until it caves in.\u201d\n\nThe cost of the demolition is not known, although bids are expected to be requested shortly to perform the work soon.",

By contrast, Costco saw nearly 7.7 million more visits during the same period.\n\nNeither company immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nWhile Numerator said the changes \"may be linked\" to the companies' respective DEI stances, a number of other factors, such as persistently high consumer prices and the availability of eggs, may have contributed to the shifting market share between the two retailers.\n\nStill, the shifts were most pronounced among Black and Hispanic/Latino households \u2014 especially during the first week of February. Specifically, Numerator said that Hispanic or Latino households drove more than one-third of Costco's gains, nearly twice the rate that would be expected based on demographic representation alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart \u2014 which never made DEI a big part of its brand identity \u2014 saw relatively consistent performance during the same four-week window, even though it scaled back some of its DEI efforts late last year.\n\nAdditionally, Numerator found that frequent Walmart shoppers were generally less concerned with DEI and social justice issues than frequent Target shoppers.\n\nThe numbers suggest that being known for one position and then changing course could push some customers away.\n\n\"That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble,\" Collage Group's chief insights officer, David Albert, recently told BI.\n\n\"We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say, and they don't say what they do,\" Albert said.\n\nNumerator also found that more than one-third of consumers in the survey were aware of the February 28 economic blackout, with younger and more diverse households more likely to participate.",

Three such will be relocations, resulting in a net increase of 25 new buildings for the fiscal year.\n\nVachris said the company has also recently extended gas station hours across North America, keeping stations open an hour later than previously and opening some locations earlier.\n\nThe CEO also said Costco introduced its updated employee agreement this month in the United States and Canada, raising the minimum hourly wage to $20 and pushing the top-of-the-scale wage for U.S. service clerks to $31.90 per hour. When hourly bonuses are factored in, the average wage for employees across the United States and Canada now exceeds $31 per hour.\n\nCompany Finances\n\nAccording to Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 reached $1.788 billion, representing an increase from $1.743 billion during the same quarter last year, he said during the call.\n\nOperating income increased by 12.3 percent compared to last year, with Millerchip noting a partial offset due to a \u201c$70 million year-over-year headwind in interest\u201d and other factors.\n\nNet sales for Costco\u2019s second quarter rose by 9.1 percent compared to the same time last year, totaling $133.36 billion for the first half of fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe company also boasted sales growth internationally, as U.S. comparable sales rose by 8.3 percent, Canada by 4.6 percent, and other international comparable sales increased by 1.7 percent, with such figures slightly larger when adjusting for gas deflation and foreign exchange impacts.\n\nCostco also reported income from increased membership fees during this period\u2014up by $82 million or 7.4 percent year over year. Executive members now account for nearly half of all paid members, at 47.1 percent, and generate nearly three-quarters of worldwide sales, a total of 73.8 percent.\n\nDespite uncertainties, including tariffs imposed on imports from the Trump administration and other economic factors, Vachris assured that Costco\u2019s strategy will continue to bring value to members.\n\nHe said that so far, there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable impact from those uncertainties, but it\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cThe impact of some return of inflation and the potential impact of tariffs could flow through,\u201d Vachris said.\n\n\u201cIn uncertain times, our members have historically placed even greater importance on the value of high-quality items at great prices, and our teams will continue to rise to this challenge by leveraging our global buying power, strong supplier relationships and innovation,\u201d he said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCostco Wholesale\u2019s newly updated employee agreement \u2014 which among other changes raises the minimum wage paid by the company by 50 cents to $20 an hour \u2014 will create a \u201cheadwind\u201d to SG&A that the company will look to offset with increased \u201clabor productivity\u201d and other improvements, the warehouse club retailer\u2019s CFO Gary Millerchip said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Issaquah, Washington-based company\u2019s CEO Ron Vachris noted that the \u201ctop of scale\u201d wage for U.S. service clerks rose $1 to $31.90 an hour with the average wage for the company\u2019s employees in the U.S. and Canada now standing at a little more than $31 an hour including hourly employee bonuses, according to a transcript of the call.\n\nAsked by an analyst about opportunities to mitigate the increased labor costs, Millerchip said the company would continue to \u201cto find ways to be more efficient, because we are committed to continuing to invest in our employees.\u201d Part of the company\u2019s code of ethics is \u201cto make sure that we're delivering industry leading wage and benefits for our employees,\u201d he said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe new employment agreement comes as the company \u2014 which offers some of the best pay and benefits in the retail industry, according to Retail Dive \u2014 has faced union pressure this year.\n\nOn Friday, Costco Teamsters voted to ratify a contract covering 18,000 of the retailer\u2019s workers, in a deal they said secured higher wages and a 22% increase in pension contributions, according to a post on the Teamsters\u2019 X account. The deal came after Costco Teamsters voted to authorize a strike in January, after negotiations on a National Master Agreement expired Jan. 31.\n\nCostco \u2018s continued investment in wages is not surprising as they have historically sought to maintain favorable above-market pay and their reputation for doing so seems both warranted and sustainable, according to Noah Rohr, an equity research analyst with Morningstar.\n\n\u201cKroger has cited an average hourly wage of $25 including employee benefits. Walmart cites its average hourly wage at about $18. And considering Costco\u2019s SG&A as a percent of sales is still very low relative to most other retailers, the wage rate seems durable,\u201d Rohr wrote in an email response to questions, adding that only about 5% of Costco\u2019s workforce is represented by unions.\n\nCostco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newly updated employee agreement.\n\nBut, this year\u2019s wage increases appear to follow on the heels of similar hikes made during Costco\u2019s 2024 fiscal year ended Sept. 1, 2024, according to a 10-K filing. In July, the company increased what it characterized as the \u201cstarting wage\u201d to at least $19.50 in all entry level positions in the U.S. and Canada, and increased all other \u201csteps of the wage scales\u201d by $0.50 to bring the average hourly rate for hourly employees to about $31 an hour at the end of 2024.\n\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 an hour. Even though President Donald Trump in December said he would consider pushing that amount up, it\u2019s not clear whether that will occur, according to a recent report from law firm Venable, which states it\u2019s also possible the president may take the more typical Republican approach of leaving the matter for states to decide.\n\nSeparately, Costco for its fiscal second quarter ended Feb. 16 reported net income rose to $1.78 billion from $1.743 billion in the year-earlier period, with net sales rising 9.1% to $62.53 billion in the year-earlier period. Despite its earnings per share of $4.02 missing consensus estimates of $4.10, JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday that they remain \u201coverweight and disciplined buyers,\u201d citing a share price target of $1,070 and noting that the company is expanding its efforts in its retail media and digital offerings.\n\n\u201cThe COST fundamental story challenges all of the best companies in our coverage (and in consumer), in our view,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Christopher Horvers wrote. \u201cNo other major retailer has succeeded in every country it entered and the club model ranks near autoparts, the top of the best sector in retail, in our view. As such, it remains a core holding and we remain Overweight.\u201d",

            "content": "Costco Wholesale Corporation COST reported its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results last Thursday after the closing bell, sparking fresh debate among investors about the stock's future direction. As a dominant player in the retail sector, Costco has long been known for its stability and strong customer base, even in the face of broader economic headwinds. Now that its latest earnings are out, investors are contemplating whether to increase their stake or hold tight to their current investments.\n\nBreaking Down Costco\u2019s Performance: A Mixed Bag of Results\n\nShares of Costco have declined 9% since its second-quarter earnings release. This drop can be attributed, in part, to the prevailing negative sentiment in the market driven by tariff concerns, as well as Costco\u2019s mixed performance in the last reported quarter. While the quarterly revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, earnings fell short of the same. (Read: Costco Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates, E-Commerce Comp Sales Rise 21%)\n\n\n\nThe company's ability to generate strong comparable sales across regions highlights its effective pricing strategy and member loyalty. Comparable sales, excluding gasoline prices and foreign exchange impacts, rose 9.1%. In the United States, comparable sales increased by 8.6%, while Canada and Other International markets saw gains of 10.5% and 10.3%, respectively.\n\n\n\nCostco ended the quarter with 78.4 million paid household members, up 6.8% from the prior year. Executive memberships, a more profitable category for Costco, grew by 9.1% year over year to reach 36.9 million, now accounting for 47.1% of all paid members and driving 73.8% of worldwide sales. The company's commitment to value and quality has fostered strong loyalty among members.\n\nHow Consensus Estimates Stack Up for Costco Post Q2 Earnings\n\nOver the past seven days, analysts have decreased their estimates for the current fiscal year by 8 cents to $17.95. However, for the next fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen by a penny to $19.70. These estimates indicate expected year-over-year growth rates of 11.4% and 9.7%, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCostco\u2019s Strong Membership Base: A Key Catalyst\n\nCostco\u2019s resilient business model, centered around a membership-based structure, continues to be a major growth driver. The company\u2019s high membership renewal rates, coupled with its efficient supply chain management and bulk purchasing power, ensure competitive pricing. Importantly, the renewal rate remained extremely strong at 93% in the United States and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. This robust model has allowed Costco to thrive, even during economic downturns.\n\n\n\nMembers pay an annual fee for access to Costco's warehouses, where they can purchase goods at significant discounts. This model not only ensures a steady inflow of revenues but also creates a sense of exclusivity and value among its members. Membership fee income rose 7.4% year over year to $1,193 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The recent membership fee increase contributed about 3% to membership fee income in the quarter, with most benefits expected in the next four quarters and the largest impact in the final quarter of the current fiscal and the first quarter of the next fiscal.\n\n\n\nCostco continuously adapts to market trends and consumer preferences. The company regularly updates its product offerings to include a mix of everyday essentials and unique, high-demand items. Through market analysis and tailored offerings, Costco has expanded its presence, both domestically and internationally.\n\n\n\nThe company plans to open 28 new warehouses in fiscal 2025, of which three will be relocations. This includes 15 new U.S. stores, three in Canada and seven in other international markets, highlighting its strong domestic and global footprint. International expansion is particularly promising, as Costco continues to build its brand in high-growth markets like Mexico, Taiwan and Korea.\n\n\n\nCostco's digital and e-commerce initiatives continue to gain traction, contributing to overall sales growth. The company registered e-commerce comparable sales growth of 20.9% in the second quarter. Costco Logistics had a record holiday shopping season with more than 500,000 deliveries. As more consumers shift to online shopping, Costco is positioning itself to capture a greater market share.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Can Costco Stay Ahead?\n\nCostco's impressive sales figures are part of a larger retail picture where competition is intensifying. Rivals like Walmart WMT and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club BJ, which also cater to value-conscious consumers, are investing in expanding their e-commerce capabilities and enhancing customer experience. Amazon AMZN continues to dominate online shopping, pushing traditional retailers to innovate rapidly.\n\n\n\nMoreover, margins remain a critical area to monitor, with potential concerns stemming from any deleverage in the selling, general and administrative rate. Additionally, foreign exchange volatility and potential tariffs create uncertainty. Meanwhile, consumer spending is shifting toward essentials, with discretionary seeing weaker demand.\n\nValuation: Is Costco Stock\u2019s Price Justified?\n\nCostco stock has been a standout performer, with shares rallying 26.8% over the past year, outpacing the industry's rise of 7.9%. This impressive growth underscores investor confidence in Costco\u2019s business model.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the stock is trading at a significant premium to its peers. Costco's forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at 49.39, higher than the industry\u2019s ratio of 30.32 and the S&P 500's 20.63.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestors should evaluate whether Costco's growth trajectory justifies its premium valuation while considering the associated risks, particularly in a changing macroeconomic environment. For those with a long-term investment horizon, Costco's historical performance and strategic initiatives may present a compelling case for holding the stock.\n\nIs Costco Stock Worth Holding Post Q2?\n\nCostco\u2019s second-quarter performance underscores its resilient business model, strong membership growth and expanding global footprint. With aggressive store expansion and e-commerce growth, the company is well-positioned for sustained long-term gains. However, its premium valuation compared to peers, foreign exchange fluctuations and tariff risks remain potential challenges. While current investors should hold the stock, new investors should wait for a pullback before buying. Costco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "content": "Reported profits from big-box retailer Costco missed Wall Street's expectations, as tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties loom over the industry.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings of $4.02 per share during the fiscal quarter that ended February 16 missed the average estimate of $4.11 compiled by Bloomberg. Higher supply chain costs weighed on costs during the period. Costco\u2019s shares fell 7% midday on March 7, following the company\u2019s quarterly report.\n\nRetailers have taken a more cautious outlook in recent weeks. Target said that some goods like fresh produce could get more expensive soon due to tariffs, while cautioning it\u2019s too early to predict when prices would change at its own stores. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s said that they\u2019re not anticipating a notable shift with interest rates or the broader housing market.\n\nIn an interview on March 7, Costco\u2019s chief financial officer Gary Millerchip said Costco\u2019s goal is to minimize the impact of tariffs on consumers, and that the company is working with suppliers to identify areas to lower costs. Since the first round of China tariffs, Costco has shifted more product sourcing to other countries like Vietnam, he added.\n\n\u201cThe picture does change and therefore you have to make sure that you\u2019re adopting plans,\u201d Millerchip said.\n\nCostco has been purchasing and storing more inventory in recent years due to supply chain constraints, Millerchip said. That\u2019s pushed up Costco\u2019s costs, he said, though having extra orders will help the retailer respond to tariffs.\n\nConsumers are willing to spend but they\u2019re being \u201cchoiceful\u201d about what they buy, Chief Executive Officer Ron Vachris said on a call with analysts on March 6. Shoppers could become even more selective, as some items such as meat get more expensive and tariffs potentially affect prices. U.S. consumer confidence declined in February by the most since August 2021, over concerns about inflation, tariffs and employment.\n\nVachris said it\u2019s difficult to predict the impact of tariffs. A third of Costco\u2019s U.S. sales are imported from other countries, and less than half of these items are from China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nThere continues to be a bifurcation in fresh food spending, he added, where people are buying both premium meat items and less expensive cuts.",

And Coke fans have been excited to see images of the new partnership swirling around social media. But, before you head to your local warehouse to get an ice-cold Coke, you need to know that the nationwide launch is still a few months away.\n\nAccording to a Coca-Cola spokesperson, the change \"will begin rolling out across all Costco warehouses in July.\" That means shoppers still have a few months of Pepsi products before the change takes place, but all locations in 14 countries will be impacted.\n\nKathleen Sheffer\n\nA Coca-Cola executive spoke out on the change. Pamela Stewart, Chief Customer Officer \u2013 Retail, North America Operating Unit, The Coca-Cola Company, told Country Living, \"Nothing beats the perfect pairing of a hot dog and an ice-cold Coca-Cola, and now, Costco members in Brentwood are the first to enjoy the return of Coca-Cola beverages to the food court\u2014a change we know will delight fans of both brands.

At Costco, they\u2019re at their best price point, according to our assistant general manager Penelope Wall.\n\n\u201cI couldn't believe what a good deal it is: a 10-pack for less than $15. Still a splurge, to be honest, but 75% less than their typical retail price,\u201d Wall says. \u201cI decided to give them a try. They are quite tasty, I like that they don\u2019t have any added sugar, and the flavor is spicy and peppery with a hint of sweetness from the pineapple. It\u2019s a nice little jolt to start your day.\u201d\n\nTurmeric has been a buzzy ingredient as of late, and it\u2019s for great reasons. The spice packs an anti-inflammatory punch and is loaded with antioxidants, and when combined with ginger\u2014like in this shot\u2014it can help relieve symptoms of common cold or stomach bugs. Plus, black pepper helps your body absorb the immune-supporting nutrients in turmeric, and it adds a little kick to these shots.\n\nThis leads us to something to keep in mind before trying these turmeric shots: if you don\u2019t like spice, it may not be for you, per Wall.\n\n\u201cThey are quite spicy and peppery. I wouldn\u2019t recommend them for people who are sensitive to spicy foods, but that\u2019s the reason I like them so much,\u201d she explains.\n\nAnother point is that these shots are not independently verified. While they include supplemental ingredients like echinacea and probiotics for immune-healthy benefits, the listed doses of these ingredients may be inaccurate. This is why it\u2019s important to find supplements that are independently verified to confirm that the label is correct and you know exactly what you\u2019re taking.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking for convenient turmeric shots at a good price, we recommend Suja Organic with Costco\u2019s price tag\u2014just be sure to drink them moderately. But honestly, our favorite way to enjoy immune-supporting drinks is by making our own anti-inflammatory shots at home. This Frozen Lemon-Ginger-Turmeric Shots recipe is a great choice. Since you can store them in the freezer for months, you\u2019ll always have them on hand for sick days.",

            "content": "The resilient retailer is still a rock-solid investment.\n\nCostco's (COST -3.93%) stock dropped 6% on March 7 after the company posted its latest earnings report. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on Feb. 16, the warehouse retailer's revenue rose 9% year over year to $63.72 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates by $640 million. Its adjusted comparable store sales also grew 9%.\n\nIts net income rose 3% to $1.79 billion, or $4.02 per share, but it missed the consensus forecast by $0.09. That earnings miss, which it mainly blamed on higher merchandise costs, clearly rattled its investors. However, I think this pullback represents a compelling buying opportunity in the evergreen retailer, for five simple reasons.\n\n1. Its comps are rising in a tough macro environment\n\nCostco's adjusted comps, which exclude its fuel sales and fluctuating foreign exchange rates, rose 10.6% in fiscal 2022, 5.2% in fiscal 2023, and 5.9% in fiscal 2024. In the first half of fiscal 2025, its adjusted comps rose another 8.1%.\n\nThat robust growth indicates that Costco is still well insulated from inflation, which generally drives consumers to make more bulk purchases to save money. During the conference call, CFO Gary Millerchip said inflation had been \"relatively flat\" for Costco \"up until this quarter,\" when its overall inflation ticked up by the \"low single digits.\" It attributed most of that pressure to its meat, bakery, and other fresh-food categories.\n\nThose inflationary headwinds could persist over the next few quarters, and the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs could prolong that pressure. Nevertheless, Costco's resilient business model has withstood several inflationary spikes since its IPO in 1985 -- and it should continue to resist that pressure and grow faster than many of its industry peers.\n\n2. It's still gaining new cardholders\n\nCostco can afford to sell its products at a low margin because it generates most of its profit from its high-margin membership subscriptions. Last September, it raised those fees for the first time in seven years.\n\nBut in the second quarter, its total number of cardholders still rose 6.6% year over year to 140.6 million. That ongoing expansion indicates that Costco is retaining its pricing power in this challenging market. As a result, its gross margin expanded five basis points year over year to 10.85% during the quarter, as its operating margin rose 10 basis points to 3.63%.\n\nSo while inflation had a greater-than-expected impact on its costs, it largely offset that pressure by gaining more cardholders. During the call, Millerchip said the company felt \"good about the overall margin\" and its \"ability to keep investing in the member.\"\n\n3. Its renewal rates are holding steady\n\nCostco is also retaining its existing members. In the second quarter, its worldwide renewal rate stayed flat year over year at 90.5%, while its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada, where 81% of its warehouses are located, rose 10 basis points to 93%.\n\nThose healthy renewal rates indicate that its memberships are sticky, and they should keep its shoppers away from smaller competitors, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club. Its rising renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada could also give it a firm foundation for its ongoing overseas expansion.\n\n4. It's still opening new warehouses\n\nOver the past few decades, many struggling retailers shrank their brick-and-mortar footprints as their comps and margins declined. Yet Costco has consistently opened new warehouses since its public debut four decades ago.\n\nIts number of year-end warehouses rose from 838 in fiscal 2022 to 890 in fiscal 2024, even as inflation and high interest rates curbed the expansion plans of many of its retail peers. Its number of warehouses rose to 897 at the end of the second quarter of 2025. Those consistent openings indicate that Costco isn't too worried about the near-term macro headwinds.\n\n5. It deserves its premium valuation\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Costco's revenue and earnings per share to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7% and 10%, respectively. Those growth rates might seem a bit low for a stock that trades at 48 times next year's earnings, but I believe Costco's evergreen business model justifies that higher valuation.\n\nSo unless Costco's comps and margin decline, it stops gaining cardholders, its renewal rates slip, and it halts its ongoing brick-and-mortar expansion, I think it will continue to command a higher multiple than many of its retail peers. That's why its recent pullback should be considered an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nCostco Wholesale\u2019s newly updated employee agreement \u2014 which among other changes raises the minimum wage paid by the company by 50 cents to $20 an hour \u2014 will create a \u201cheadwind\u201d to SG&A that the company will look to offset with increased \u201clabor productivity\u201d and other improvements, the warehouse club retailer\u2019s CFO Gary Millerchip said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Issaquah, Washington-based company\u2019s CEO Ron Vachris noted that the \u201ctop of scale\u201d wage for U.S. service clerks rose $1 to $31.90 an hour with the average wage for the company\u2019s employees in the U.S. and Canada now standing at a little more than $31 an hour including hourly employee bonuses, according to a transcript of the call.\n\nAsked by an analyst about opportunities to mitigate the increased labor costs, Millerchip said the company would continue to \u201cto find ways to be more efficient, because we are committed to continuing to invest in our employees.\u201d Part of the company\u2019s code of ethics is \u201cto make sure that we're delivering industry leading wage and benefits for our employees,\u201d he said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe new employment agreement comes as the company \u2014 which offers some of the best pay and benefits in the retail industry, according to CFO Dive sister publication Retail Dive \u2014 has faced union pressure this year.\n\nOn Friday, Costco Teamsters voted to ratify a contract covering 18,000 of the retailer\u2019s workers, in a deal they said secured higher wages and a 22% increase in pension contributions, according to a post on the Teamsters\u2019 X account. The deal came after Costco Teamsters voted to authorize a strike in January, after negotiations on a National Master Agreement expired Jan. 31.\n\nCostco \u2018s continued investment in wages is not surprising as they have historically sought to maintain favorable above-market pay and their reputation for doing so seems both warranted and sustainable, according to Noah Rohr, an equity research analyst with Morningstar.\n\n\u201cKroger has cited an average hourly wage of $25 including employee benefits. Walmart cites its average hourly wage at about $18. And considering Costco\u2019s SG&A as a percent of sales is still very low relative to most other retailers, the wage rate seems durable,\u201d Rohr wrote in an email response to questions, adding that only about 5% of Costco\u2019s workforce is represented by unions.\n\nCostco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newly updated employee agreement.\n\nBut, this year\u2019s wage increases appear to follow on the heels of similar hikes made during Costco\u2019s 2024 fiscal year ended Sept. 1, 2024, according to a 10-K filing. In July, the company increased what it characterized as the \u201cstarting wage\u201d to at least $19.50 in all entry level positions in the U.S. and Canada, and increased all other \u201csteps of the wage scales\u201d by $0.50 to bring the average hourly rate for hourly employees to about $31 an hour at the end of 2024.\n\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage stands at $7.25 an hour. Even though President Donald Trump in December said he would consider pushing that amount up, it\u2019s not clear whether that will occur, according to a recent report from law firm Venable, which states it\u2019s also possible the president may take the more typical Republican approach of leaving the matter for states to decide.\n\nSeparately, Costco for its fiscal second quarter ended Feb. 16 reported net income rose to $1.78 billion from $1.743 billion in the year-earlier period, with net sales rising 9.1% to $62.53 billion in the year-earlier period. Despite its earnings per share of $4.02 missing consensus estimates of $4.10, JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday that they remain \u201coverweight and disciplined buyers,\u201d citing a share price target of $1,070 and noting that the company is expanding its efforts in its retail media and digital offerings.\n\n\u201cThe COST fundamental story challenges all of the best companies in our coverage (and in consumer), in our view,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Christopher Horvers wrote. \u201cNo other major retailer has succeeded in every country it entered and the club model ranks near autoparts, the top of the best sector in retail, in our view. As such, it remains a core holding and we remain Overweight.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, provided important guidance to investors last Friday, emphasizing the difficult market conditions ahead. He highlighted the instability caused by President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. Cramer warned that this uncertainty could lead to further losses for investors. Looking ahead to the coming week, Cramer pointed out a significant event on Wednesday when the consumer price index (CPI) data will be released. He added:\n\n\u201cI'll tell you this, If we get a soft CPI and a soft PPI on Thursday, the drumbeat of a rate cut will grow so loud, so loud, it might even overshadow the pained forecast for the White House. With cool inflation meetings, the Fed has no reason not to cut.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Commented On These 6 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer and Analysts Like These 10 Stocks\n\nCramer turned his attention to Friday when the Michigan consumer sentiment number will be reported, acknowledging that this indicator was not something he paid much attention to during President Biden\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI didn't focus on this number much at all under President Biden because Biden was very predictable so it was easy to make plans. Sure, Wall Street's hated many of Biden's policies, especially on interest, but he rarely took us by surprise. Trump surprises us every day.\u201d\n\nCramer pointed out the importance of consumer sentiment, stating, \u201cWe\u2019re a consumer-driven economy, people.\u201d He explained that if optimism prevails, some stocks that might seem risky could actually be good buys.\n\nOn the other hand, if pessimism takes hold, many fund managers may sell off stocks tied to the economy, only to see those same stocks rebound once the selling pressure subsides. Cramer also highlighted an important point: while markets can absorb negativity, they cannot handle uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: Look, it's one of the toughest markets I've seen in years... So if you wanna buy a stock, make sure not to buy it all once. Buy slowly because the stock you purchase might be down five points by the time you get your report.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 7. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.",

The warehouse giant\u2019s stock was up 5% year-to-date, until very recently, outperforming the S&P 500 which was down 2%. Now, in the past week, COST stock has lost over 10%, while the S&P lost 3.8%. Year-to-date the stock is still ahead, dropping 2.5% vs. a 6% drop for the index. However, the stock is acting weak, as of mid-day on Thursday, March 13, and is down a further 3.6% today, with the S&P sliding 1.3%. Amidst rising living costs, Costco\u2019s value-centric proposition has resonated with consumers, as evident in its 9% y-o-y sales growth in January 2025, outpacing the U.S. retail sector\u2019s 4% sales growth.\n\nBut Here\u2019s The Thing: Even Costco isn\u2019t immune to economic downturns. As recently as 2022, Costco\u2019s stock price plummeted by as much as 30% over just a few quarters, highlighting its vulnerability to market volatility. This historical precedent raises concerns that Costco\u2019s current share price of around $940 could potentially drop to $650 levels if similar market conditions recur. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.\n\nWhy Is It Relevant Now?\n\nAgain, while Costco might be promising great things with its plans for international expansion, widening product offerings, and exclusive membership rewards, there is a larger risk to the U.S. economy, which is worth factoring in right now.\n\nCostco\u2019s business model is dependent on international trade, with approximately one-third of its U.S. sales generated from imported products. Notably, the company\u2019s import exposure is diversified, with less than 20% of imports sourced from China, Mexico, and Canada.The proposed 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports poses a significant risk, potentially driving up grocery prices and leading to shortages of essential items in the U.S. Additionally, tariffs on Chinese imports may also drive up the prices of electronics and furniture sold at Costco.\n\nWhile inflation fears have eased, they still linger. Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on tariffs and immigration has reignited concerns about inflation\u2019s potential return. This uncertainty, combined with the U.S. economy\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn, raises the specter of a recession. See our analysis here on the macro picture. The global geopolitical climate has grown increasingly volatile, marked by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, escalating trade tensions, and frayed relationships with traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe. These factors introduce substantial risks, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring the macroeconomic outlook.\n\nHow resilient is COST stock during a downturn?\n\nCOST stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.\n\nInflation Shock (2022)\n\n\u2022 COST stock fell 30.6% from a high of $600.04 on 8 April 2022 to $416.43 on 20 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023\n\n\u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $1,076.86 on 13 February 2025 and currently trades at around $940\n\nCovid Pandemic (2020)\n\n\u2022 COST stock fell 13.6% from a high of $324.08 on 20 February 2020 to $279.85 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500\n\n\u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 July 2020\n\nProtecting Wealth\n\nIn summary, it also doesn\u2019t help that Costco\u2019s stock is still expensive. The company stock\u2019s current valuation of 58 times last year\u2019s earnings appears stretched, significantly exceeding the pre-pandemic price-to-earnings range of 25 to 30. Now, Costco\u2019s Revenue growth has slowed down, with FY 2024 marking the slowest growth in seven years. So yes, while we all love Costco for low prices and convenient services \u2013 ask yourself the question: do you want to hold on to your Costco stock now, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $800, $700, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy.

            "content": "There are many beloved Costco items warehouse shoppers swear by, but none could ever dethrone the famed rotisserie chicken. The $4.99 favorite is known for consistently moist and delicious meat, and it\u2019s the perfect starting point for an endless number of easy meals.\n\nWe\u2019ve relied on this convenience dinner for over two decades, so now it\u2019s time to find out where these birds actually come from and how, through years of ever-rising grocery prices, they\u2019ve been able to stay shockingly low-cost.\n\nWhere Do Costco\u2019s Rotisserie Chickens Come From?\n\nCostco roasts and seasons its chickens in-house, providing customers with a meal that's ready to eat right from the deli counter. But, before those chickens arrive at Costco's warehouse locations, they must first be \u201charvested\u201d from a grower. And, just as we learned in our Kirkland bacon investigation, the story\u2019s not as simple as tracking down one certain grower.\n\nWe spoke to poultry processing expert, Ryan Stegall, to get answers about Costco's rotisserie chickens\u2019 origins.\n\n\"Costco traditionally utilizes single-source suppliers for most of [its] other products, however, because of the meat industry, it\u2019s very difficult to use a single source depending on where they\u2019re going to get it from,\" he explained.\n\nFang Zheng/Getty Images\n\nAt one point, Costco was buying all of its chickens from Tyson and Foster Farms, but, after reported fall-outs with these companies, Costco made some big changes to its chicken production to vertically integrate the poultry process and essentially own everything. In 2019, the grocer established its own massive chicken production complex in Fremont, Nebraska, and partnered with a company called Lincoln Premium Poultry (LPP) to manage it.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, with this system, Costco owns the facility but pays the private company to raise the chickens from eggs to pullets to broilers, slaughter them, and ship them out raw to stores. Not only does this take a whole lot of liability off Costco\u2019s shoulders, but it also helps keep costs low for the consumers.\n\n\"Costco will have the ability to audit that,\" Stegall adds. \"Essentially, if you screw up they\u2019ll take it from you and sell it to somebody else, almost like a franchise model.\"\n\nCurrently, LPP aims to supply Costco with 500,000 hens per month\u2014that\u2019s six million chickens per year. Even though that number sounds massive (because it is), Costco sells over 100 million chickens per year, so it\u2019s really a small percentage of the total marketplace.\n\n\"But, that Lincoln Premium Poultry model is the model Costco\u2019s going to use moving forward,\" confirmed Stegall.\n\nThe benefit of supplying this way is that Costco is 100% in control, and when it comes to producing a food product known for its low cost and consistency, that oversight is important. For the Costco customer, it means you can rely on purchasing a juicy, spit-roasted chicken right around three pounds every single shopping trip.\n\nSo, whether it\u2019s turned into a white chicken chili, spicy chicken enchiladas, or a creamy chicken salad, a rotisserie chicken from Costco is guaranteed to be in good hands from start to finish.\n\n",

This lead many disgruntled shoppers to start a petition called \u201dBring back the Costco turkey pesto sandwich\" in March 2022 where some called discontinuing the item the store\u2019s worst move.\n\n\u201cEver since it left my life has not been the same,\u201d one petition supporter said, according to Tasting Table.\n\nNow, they can return to their local Costco food court to order the long-awaited sandwich once again in a few days \u2014 and hope it becomes a permanent fixture, like the $1.50 Kirkland hot dogs.\n\nThis is the latest in a slew of Costco food court menu updates. Just last month, Costco debuted a #3 strawberry banana smoothie that has already become a fan favorite menu item.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

            "content": "What's that? You're not fully aware of the myriad of Costco membership benefits that come with being part of the club? Here's a closer look at some additional ways your membership can save you money and, in some cases, make your life a little (or a lot) easier.\n\nA Costco membership is a wise move to help stretch your grocery or household budget, and that's hardly a secret now. The discounts for members are everywhere! But did you know that budget-friendly household purchases are merely the start of the Costco perks? The savviest Costco members are doing far more than stocking their pantries at the big box retailer.\n\n01 of 15 Costco Direct First of all, you don't need to be in a store to save. Costco members can take advantage of the wholesaler\u2019s online-only Costco Direct savings program. The more eligible items members buy, the more they save, with discounts ranging from $100 to $400. Tagged products include big-ticket items like appliances and outdoor furniture, and each offer is valid while supplies last. Every Costco membership can redeem this offer twice, and all orders must be checked out at the same time and shipped to the same address to qualify.\n\n02 of 15 Costco Next Similar to Costco Direct, Costco Next is a program that provides exclusive online deals. But these discounts are negotiated between Costco and third-party manufacturers, so you won't be buying from Costco directly. Once you find a deal on the Costco Next page, you'll be redirected to the supplier's page, which will handle payment and shipping. Some brands featured include Viking, Green Pan, Otterbox, and Kingston Kitchen & Bath.\n\n03 of 15 Costco Optical For those who do not have vision insurance, undergoing routine eye exams and purchasing eyeglasses can be extremely costly. This was the case for Carter Seuthe, VP of Content at Credit Summit, who turned to Costco's vision offerings for help. \"Your Costco membership entitles you to discounts at their in-store clinic as well as deep discounts on glasses and contacts,\" says Seuthe. Costco Optical provides vision services to members whether or not they have vision insurance (though it also accepts most major insurance coverage).\n\n04 of 15 Member Prescription Program Members who currently don't have prescription drug coverage can enroll in Costco's Member Prescription Program, which enables them to get lower prices for an extensive list of prescriptions. Savings are estimated between 2% and 80% off, and pet medications are available as well.\n\n05 of 15 Costco Travel One of the most noteworthy Costco perks is Costco Travel. This one membership benefit alone pushed Linda Chavez, founder and CEO of Seniors Life Insurance Finder, to join Costco. \"I'm a frequent traveler, but believe it or not, I book my vacations through Costco and save a lot of money,\" says Chavez. Costco Travel offers members the ability to book destinations, hotels, and cruises through the club. More importantly, the wholesale behemoth uses its substantial purchasing power to negotiate serious deals that it passes along to members. In Chavez's case, using Costco's travel benefit consistently translates into serious savings. \"My husband and I paid $1,775 per person for seven nights at an all-inclusive resort in the Maldives in February,\" she says. \"Flights, airport transfers, and all-inclusive accommodations were all included in this price. When we tested American Express, the same package cost $1,950 per user. We spent the $350 we saved booking through Costco on a dolphin cruise and had a great time.\"\n\n06 of 15 Kirkland Signature Gasoline If you live anywhere near a Costco location, you've likely encountered the lines of cars waiting for their turn at the Costco gas station. There are several benefits to buying gas at Costco, not the least of which is the price discount. Costco also touts its gas as having performance and environmental benefits, including helping clean up dirty engines and restoring fuel economy by promoting cleaner engines. The Kirkland gas used by Costco also promises to reduce tailpipe pollution caused by intake valve deposits and plugged fuel injectors. \"The fuel is top tier, which means it follows a high-quality level and includes detergents to keep your engine clean,\" says Chavez. 14 Best Kirkland Signature Products That Are Worth Your Money\n\n07 of 15 Discounted Gift Cards Even when it comes to something as minor as purchasing gift cards, your Costco membership can come in handy and keep more cash in your pocket, says Chavez. \"Costco offers deals like two $50 gift cards for $79.99 or four $15 gift cards for $44.99,\" notes Chavez. \"These offers make stocking up on gift cards for Christmas or birthdays a breeze. Gift cards for movie theatres, theme parks, performances, activities, and more are also available.\"\n\n08 of 15 Author Signings Undoubtedly one of the lesser-known perks of membership, Costco is not only a great place to get a deal on the price of a new book, but you may also meet a book author or two. In the past, the club has hosted book signings, says Chavez.\n\n09 of 15 Remember Insurance Costco members can get car insurance at a discount through the wholesale club via CONNECT from American Family Insurance. Brian Dechesare, founder of the website Breaking Into Wall Street, suggests obtaining a quote from Costco to see how rates compare to what you're currently paying. \"With its buying and influential power, a massive business like Costco can negotiate inexpensive group rates and pass those savings down to their customers,\" says Dechesare. You can also shop for discounts on home, life, and pet insurance through Costco's Remember Insurance. Some health insurance plans are available to business owners. As far as savings, one example is their pet insurance through Figo, which is 15% off for members only.\n\n10 of 15 Extended Warranties Through its warranty services, the club automatically provides extended warranties of up to two years for various purchases like televisions, projectors, computers, and major appliances. \"Costco's extended warranty on electronics is the best in the business. For example, if you buy an iPhone at Costco, you will receive an additional one-year warranty beyond the manufacturer's warranty,\" says Scotty Kilmer of Car Windshields. \"If you buy the same phone at Best Buy or any other major electronic retailer, you will not only not receive an extended warranty, but you will also have to pay an additional fee for [it].\"\n\n11 of 15 Technical Support So you finally splurged on that new TV, but now you have no idea how to set it up? Not to worry: You can receive free tech support over the phone for any major appliance you purchase from Costco, whether it's a flat screen TV or a piece of exercise equipment.\n\n12 of 15 Affordable Office Furniture While you may not find a wide variety of office furniture in-store, Costco sells affordable desks, office chairs, printers, computers, and other necessities online for those starting up a business, says Texas-based entrepreneur Andrey Doichev, founder of the website Inc and Go. \"It can be delivered directly to your location, and most items will have a warranty protecting your purchase,\" says Doichev. \"I've used Costco to ship my workstation directly to my home office...the convenience was important as I have pretty packed days with consulting and developing Inc and Go. I comparison-shopped first and found I was saving 10 to 15 percent on the cost of furnishings.\"\n\n13 of 15 Business and Personal Checks Been meaning to order new checks? Offered in a wide variety of designs, Costco members can buy business and personal checks, as well as forms and other accessories (envelopes, ink stamps, address labels, etc), for an average of 50 percent off typical bank pricing.\n\n14 of 15 Water Delivery Need to add a water cooler to your home or office? Purified, distilled, and artesian water are all available for delivery with your membership. Exclusive pricing for members starts at $7.49 per five-gallon bottle. Dispenser rental prices are discounted, as well.",

I mean, my mind is still stuck on that TikTok\u2019s cheese hotdog hack (which totally works, I might add!) and the pizza-in-a-ziploc bag trick . So yeah, things are already pretty epic at the Costco food court. But now it\u2019s even better because Costco has *finally* brought back one of their most famous items. Us food court fans are losing it.\n\nLaura Lamb of CostcoHotFinds \u2014AKA the queen of Costco\u2014announced the retailer is now offering the iconic hot turkey and provolone sandwich. Starting next week, the sandwich will be available to order in all locations. It\u2019s already available in a few Oregon locations, according to some Redditors who\u2019ve ordered the sandwich.\n\nICYMI, the hot turkey and provolone sandwich was a food court favorite before it was discontinued during the pandemic. Now, Costco has quietly added it back to its menu. The new sandwich isn\u2019t that different from the original, aside from a price hike (it now retails at $6.99 instead of $3.99) and includes more turkey deli slices and pesto mayo. It\u2019s also made in batches and warmed in the ovens like the pizzas instead of being made-to-order. Other than that, it\u2019s the same sandwich we just ate a few years prior.\n\n\u201cThe bread was so warm and soft and it had a crunch,\u201d Lamb said, per the clip. \u201cI love the garlic mayo. This one is so filling and just incredible.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Costco Replaced Its Churros With A Cookie & Shoppers Are Not Having It\n\nFans quickly commented under Lamb\u2019s video, sharing their thoughts and excitement over the news. \u201cStopppp, absolute best thing ever,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cI used to love those sandwiches when I worked at the store,\u201d read another comment.\n\n\u201cYAYYYYYYYYYYYYY\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73. This was the ONLY item I ate at the food court for years!!!!!,\u201d one fan raved.\n\nMost fans are psyched about this rerelease, but some are hesitant about the price difference. \u201cWhat happened to it being $3.99 \ud83d\ude06,\u201d one person wrote. Another pointed out that the higher price should automatically make the sandwich a combo meal. \u201cFor $7, it better come with a side and drink,\u201d they advised. As of right now, it\u2019s unconfirmed whether the sandwich is retailed separately or comes as a combo.\n\nUltimately, most of us are excited that this new addition is coming to stories. Now if only they could bring back the combo pizzas and brisket sandwiches. Sigh.",

The research positioned Market Basket as the supermarket with the lowest prices in the country. It highlighted it as the most competitive grocery retailer today.\n\n| Instagram, @costco\n\nAt Costco, an annual membership is required, while Walmart has seen price increases.

Under his leadership, sales grew, and the employee workforce increased.\n\nHowever, in 2014, a dispute in the board of directors led to his dismissal. A family member voted in favor of Arthur S. Demoulas, a descendant of George, who managed to regain control of the business.\n\nDespite these conflicts, Market Basket continues to grow and establish itself as an economical alternative for consumers in the United States.

With the right decor touches (and, you know, plumbing), these multipurpose sheds can become the perfect retreat right in your own backyard. If you\u2019re dreaming of creating a compact, cozy haven without breaking the bank, Costco right now has a deal you can\u2019t miss. Now through March 31, Costco members can save up to $4,000 on the Yardline Upton wood shed\u2014a stylish and versatile option to embrace the small-space lifestyle.\n\nAdmittedly, reading the word \"shed\" might conjure visions of craft stations and tools as far as the eye can see, but this Yardline structure can be so much more. It features a 96-inch set of double doors that are 48 inches wide and three operable windows that can be placed however you'd like. This pick even comes with an optional floor, so it can turn into an extra play area for your kids or as a fitness studio if you love to work out. Thanks to its generous 12-foot-by-24-foot floor plan, this structure is incredibly roomy.\n\nThe Yardline Upton comprises pre-cut pieces for a DIY project. However, if you're looking to ease off the elbow grease, you can also pay to have it installed on your behalf. That's exactly what Laura Lamb of Costco Hot Finds did\u2014and she shared her experience with this on Instagram. \"That\u2019s what we chose, and they had it done in one day,\" she captioned her IG Reel. I can\u2019t say enough good things about their incredible team, too.\"\n\nWe're not the only ones intrigued by this shed: Lambs' IG followers are equally smitten. \"My family got this shed due to your post. It is so easy to build and an absolutely amazing shed. Second to none,\" one viewer wrote. \"I'd turn that into a nice bar mini nightclub,\" a second commented. Meanwhile, several more people were musing about what they'd do with the shed, throwing around ideas like turning it into an office, an in-law studio, or a home gym. \"This would make the cutest little guest house,\" one person said.\n\nOne caveat to this product: The Yardline shed is on sale, but it's by no means cheap. While flooring and professional installation cost an additional fee, pricing for this structure is $5,000 (the lowest) and $10,000 (with floor and installation included)\u2014yes, that's with the discount. But when you think about how much extending an area of your house can cost, this shed is a worthy alternative.\n\n",

The company also scored nearly $8 million in tax incentives last month for its first store in New Braunfels.\n\nThe locations in Prosper and Weatherford, both suburbs of the sprawling Dallas-Fort World metroplex, are slated to open in March along with new stores in California, Michigan, and Massachusetts. In April, the company will be opening stores in Stuart, Florida, along with Minami Alps in Japan and Ardeer in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Q2 earnings call took place on Thursday, March 6. Ron Vachris, President and Chief Executive Officer at Costco, said the company increased its \"bottom-of-the-scale wage\" by 50 cents on March 3, increasing it to $20 per hour.\n\nThe average wage for U.S. and Canadian Costco employees is more than $31 per hour, according to Vachris, who noted that a majority of the wages for employees at the top of the pay scale are based on tenure.\n\nThe company is also now offering paid vacation time for new employees in the first year of employment, while employees working at Costco for more than 30 years will qualify for six weeks worth of paid time off.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the second quarter of the year, Costco posted $62.53 billion in net sales which was a 9.1 percent increase from Q2 in 2024 which had $57.33 billion in sales, along with 5.7 percent increased traffic in stores, according to the company. It also saw 90.5 worldwide membership renewal rate, with U.S. and Canadian customers boasting 93 percent in renewals. Costco has more than 78.4 million paid members, according to the Q2 data.\n\n\"Given events over the last week, it is difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, but our team remains agile and our goal will be to minimize the impact of related cost increases to our members,\" Vachris said. \"About a third of our sales in the U.S. are imported from other countries, and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico, and Canada.\"\n\nCostco came under fire in January after 19 Republican attorneys general, including Texas' Ken Paxton, issued a scathing open letter to the private business over its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices and policies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

Despite being tiny, this fan is mighty and keeps you cool all summer long.\n\nIf you haven't seen the Woozoo yet, you'll want it immediately once you do!\n\n\"My favorite little fan is back at Costco. This one provides the best white noise for sleeping,\" said TikTokker Costco Hot Finds. \"This is the WooZoo and I swear it gets better every year. This fan oscillates in multi directions, it has a timer, remote and touch controls. It cools up to 350 square feet and it does have a function to turn off those LED lights.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok, for once, was in agreement about the little but strong fan. \"For real this is the BEST! Ours has probably been on for two and a half straight years at this point \ud83d\ude02\" commented TikTok user JK. \"Same!! I don\u2019t think we ever turn off the ones next to our bed lol\" replied Costco Hot Finds. \"I have a couple of these and love them,\" commented GeekManGreg.\n\nAll About the Woozoo\n\nThe Woozoo fan also has almost 3000 5 star reviews on Costco. \"This is the third Woozoo 5-Speed Globe Fan which I have purchased. This latest purchase was to replace a fan that I purchased several years ago and used in my bedroom at night and sometimes in the adjacent room in which I work during the day. The volume of air which he moves is amazing,\" shared reviewer Jo Collier. \"On low-medium speeds, the fan is so quiet that I can\u2019t hear it. The pitch/sound of the fan on higher speeds adds sufficient 'white noise' to block out noise when I sleep. I\u2019ve like these fans so munch that I bought another fan which I use in the living room to additional air circulation. The remote control for the newer model was slightly changed vs. the older models.\"\n\nSome customers did mention that the fan doesn't tilt down very far, so this is important to keep in mind if you planned to place the fan somewhere up high. It works best at a more level location.\n\nThe Woozoo 5-Speed Globe fan retails for $47.99 and customers say it's well worth every penny. You can find the fan in store or on Costco's website.\n\nSIGN UP for the Parade Home & Garden newsletter for a weekly dose of our favorite house hacks, decor trends and shopping deals\n\nRelated: Costco Just Dropped the Dreamiest Egg Chair\u2014And It\u2019s Perfect for Spring",

It has five nesting boxes, comes with a waterer and feeder, and two roosts.\n\nSome comments on social media claim that a chicken coop can be made at home for half the price, which we don't deny, but if you don't have experience with building something from the ground up or have much practice with power tools, a DIY chicken coop might not be an option. You can find some more affordable chicken coops online, it's true, but we have to admit this one looks pretty nice! (This exact coop is also in two additional colors\u2014classic red and coastal blue.)\n\nSome other features include moisture resistant flooring and siding, two vents, and and two screened windows that open and close. The roof is designed to have rain water run off the back of the coop and keeps the runoff water away from the nesting boxes.\n\nIt claims to only take 60 minutes to put together, and with only a screw gun (and three to four people). Despite the price tag, this coop has great reviews boasting its sturdiness, spaciousness, and ease of assembly.\n\nSo if you're looking for a coop that comes with all the bells and whistles that you don't have to make yourself, this could be a good option for you and your brood. Plus, with those windows and painted trim, you know it's going to look oh so cute in your backyard!",

Costco said fewer than 20% of its US inventory comes from the three nations.\n\nCostco shares fell Friday after second-quarter results reflected cautious consumer spending, per Yahoo Finance.

This travel agency, exclusive to Costco members, offers a unique opportunity to unlock substantial savings on airfares, hotels, rental cars, cruises, vacation packages, and more.\n\nLet's explore how Costco Travel works, including its membership requirements, the array of travel services it provides, and how it stacks up against other methods of booking travel.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nCostco Travel is a travel agency that you can access with a Costco membership. It offers a variety of travel packages and options. However, flights must be booked as part of a package, as standalone flight bookings are not possible.\n\nCostco Travel allows members to book a wide range of travel-related services. These include flights with airlines like United, hotels, rental cars that you can pick up at your destination, cruises such as Disney and Royal Caribbean, and package deals to inclusive resorts.\n\nWith its significant buying authority, Costco Travel offers savings on travel packages. This often translates into lower prices for popular destinations across North America, including Alaska, Canada, and Mexico's Cancun and other locations. Moreover, it also extends to sought-after destinations like Hawaii and countries in Europe, such as France, Spain, Italy, and Greece.\n\nWhat is Costco Travel?\n\nCostco Travel is an in-house travel agency run by the membership-only warehouse club, and it's designed to provide savings specifically to Costco members.\n\nTo use Costco Travel to book some or all of your next trips, you need to be a member. There are four membership options available:\n\nGold Star: $60 annually\n\n$60 annually Gold Star Executive: $120 annually\n\n$120 annually Business: $60 annually\n\n$60 annually Business Executive: $120 annually\n\nOnce you're a member, you can book flights, hotels, rental cars, cruises, vacation packages, theme parks, and select experiences. You cannot, however, book a flight on its own through the service. Your flight needs to be part of a Costco Travel package.\n\nWhen booking your trip, you can run a search on the Costco Travel website just like you would with Priceline or Expedia to compare options and prices from several travel providers.\n\nBecause of Costco's buying authority, it can manage to score savings on different aspects of your trip \u2014 or the whole thing \u2014 that you might not be able to find on your own, even with intense research.\n\nCostco Travel packages\n\nIn September 2023, for instance, I found a Costco vacation package for eight nights in a deluxe villa at Palms at Wailea on Maui. This getaway vacation came with round flights from Tampa, Florida, as well as a full-size rental car for a total of $5,594.15.\n\nThe package also included a $116 digital Costco Shop Card and resort fees such as damage protection and cleaning fees within the total price. However, there was a cancellation fee of $200.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I searched for the same stay at the hotel during the same period, the price tag for the stay alone was $5,561.90.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Costco Travel compares to other booking methods\n\nWhile Costco Travel can furnish discounts and savings you might not be able to find on your own, it's still a good idea to research all of your options. That includes using other third-party travel websites such as Priceline and Expedia or booking directly with airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and so on.\n\nOther travel websites\n\nWhile Costco has the negotiating power to provide savings on its vacation packages, it's not the only travel agency that can do that. Depending on what you're trying to do, you may be able to find a similar package on a website like Priceline, Expedia, or Orbitz for less than what you'd pay through Costco Travel.\n\nAlso, you may find certain features on other discount travel sites that you won't get with Costco Travel and vice versa.\n\nFor example, Priceline and Expedia allow you to book a flight without bundling it with a hotel or vacation package. You may also have a different selection of airlines, hotels, rental car companies, experiences, and more.\n\nIn contrast, one nice feature of Costco Travel is that you see the full price from the start. With some booking websites, the initial pricing may not reflect taxes and fees, which can make for an unpleasant surprise when you get to the checkout stage.\n\nBooking directly with travel providers\n\nWhile travel agency websites like Costco Travel can provide significant savings, they don't give you access to every airline, hotel, or rental car company.\n\nFor example, Costco Travel provides rental car quotes from specific brands such as Alamo, Avis, Budget, and Enterprise. As a result, it's essential to shop around to make sure you're not missing out on savings Costco Travel can't show you. Comparing car rental options on Autoslash makes it easy to check prices and make sure you're getting the best deal. If you have a favorite airline or hotel brand, you should also check with them directly to price shop.\n\nHow to save even more on Costco Travel\n\nOn its own, Costco Travel can offer incredible savings. But there are some things you can do to maximize your savings when using the website.\n\n1. Get a Costco Executive membership\n\nAs an executive member, you'll earn 2% cash back on every eligible purchase you make through Costco Travel, which is on top of the rewards you'd earn using your credit card. There are, however, some exclusions, such as travel purchased through a third party, trip protection, gratuities, taxes, and fees.\n\nAlso, executive members may get special perks with Costco Travel vacation packages, such as resort credits.\n\n2. Consider using the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi\n\nThe Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi is one of the best store credit cards on the market. Not only can you use it anywhere Visa is accepted, but it comes with an impressive rewards structure.\n\nYou'll earn 5% cash back rewards on gas at Costco and earn 4% cash back on other eligible gas and electric vehicle (EV) charging purchases for the first $7,000 combined spend per year, and then 1% thereafter; 3% on restaurants and eligible travel purchases; 2% on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com; and 1% on all other purchases.\n\nThe only downside is that you get your rewards only once a year in the form of a certificate you can cash or use to make purchases at Costco warehouses.\n\n3. Pay with another rewards credit card\n\nWhile Costco only accepts Visa credit cards and debit cards at its warehouse clubs, you can use a Visa or Mastercard credit card to make payments through Costco Travel. Also note that if you're booking a rental car, you can reserve your car without providing credit card information upfront.\n\nWith this in mind, you may be able to get more value out of another rewards credit card. For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers 3X on other travel and dining.\n\nPoints are also worth 50% more when you redeem them for travel booked through Chase Travel\u2120. That gives you a higher possible redemption rate on travel purchases you make with Costco Travel, and you could potentially get even more value if you transfer your points to one of Chase's travel partners.\n\nAnother option is the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card, which also offers 3X points on restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, popular streaming services, and phone plans. The card doesn't offer bonus value when booking travel, but it doesn't charge an annual fee and offers bonus rewards on a lot of other everyday spending categories.\n\nCostco Travel FAQ\n\nCan I use Costco Travel if I am not a member? No, you can't use Costco Travel without a valid Costco membership. You can become a member by visiting the Costco website or by visiting your local Costco warehouse. The Gold Star membership costs $60 per year, while the Gold Star Executive membership costs $120 per year. Does Costco Travel only take Visa? Costco Travel accepts Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards.

That\u2019s a 9.1% increase over $57.33 in the year-ago period. In the U.S., Costco comparable sales grew 8.3% year over year.\n\nOperating income also grew in the quarter, to $2.32 billion from $2.06 billion the prior year.\n\nConsumers shopped 5.7% more frequently in the quarter compared to Q2 the year before. Along with that, average order value (AOV) grew 1% globally and 2.6% in the U.S.\n\nLooking ahead, CEO Ron Vachris said he expects foreign exchange to negatively impact the retailer. Given the shifting policies surrounding U.S. imposed tariffs, it\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d to predict how they will impact Costco, he said.\n\nAbout a third of Costco sales in the U.S. are imported from other countries, Vachris said.

View Details\n\nCostco ecommerce sales Q2\n\nIn its fiscal Q2 2025, Costco ecommerce sales grew more than 20% year over year for the third time since the retailer\u2019s fiscal Q3 2021.\n\nCostco ecommerce sales grew 20.9% in Q2. It was the sixth consecutive quarter that Costco increased ecommerce sales after four straight with year-over-year declines for its entire fiscal 2023.\n\nCostco\u2019s new warehouse tool in its app, which allows members to view local warehouse item availability and prices, had more than 43 million visits in the quarter, said chief financial officer Gary Millerchip.\n\nFor the first time, Millerchip said, Costco sent out multiple versions of its digital multi-vendor mailers. It personalized those different versions to members based on their previous shopping behavior.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do in this area and are excited about the potential to improve the member experience through more relevant targeted messages and experiences,\u201d Millerchip said. \u201cWhile strength in bullion was a meaningful tailwind to ecommerce sales, home furnishings, small electrics, hardware and sporting goods were a few of the other departments that grew double-digits year over year.\u201d\n\nCostco Logistics also marked a record holiday season in the retailer\u2019s fiscal Q2, Millerchip said. It completed more than 500,000 deliveries while growing share in \u201cbig and bulky\u201d items.\n\nCostco Next, the retailer\u2019s marketplace, also had record holiday sales, he said, not quantifying the amount. The marketplace is approaching 100 vendor sites and \u201csignificantly grew\u201d AOV in the quarter, he added.\n\nHow many members does Costco have?\n\nCostco ended its Q2 with 78.4 million paid household members. That\u2019s 6.8% more than the prior year\u2019s Q2. It\u2019s also an increase from 77.4 million in Q1.\n\nThe retailer also grew its number of cardholders 6.6% year over year to 140.6 million.\n\nAdditionally, Costco finished its Q2 with 36.9 million paid executive memberships. That marks 9.1% growth over Q2 the year before. It\u2019s also more than the 36.4 million executive members in Q1.\n\nWorldwide, 90.5% of members renewed their memberships in Q2. That figure was higher in the U.S., where it was 93%.\n\nExecutive members now represent 47.1% of Costco paid members and 73.8% of worldwide sales.\n\nCostco membership fee income accounted for $1.19 billion in Q2 revenue. That\u2019s 7.4% growth (or $82 million more) than the prior year\u2019s Q2.\n\nHow many countries have a Costco?\n\nAs of the end of its fiscal Q1 2025, Costco operates 897 warehouses.

Given events over the last week, it is difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, but our team remains agile and our goal will be to minimize the impact of related cost increases to our members,\u201d he said, noting that about a third of Costco\u2019s U.S. sales are from items imported from other countries, and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico and Canada.\n\n\u201cIn uncertain times, our members have historically placed even greater importance on the value of high-quality items at great prices,\" he said. \"And our teams will continue to rise to this challenge by leveraging our global buying power, strong supplier relationships and innovation.\u201d\n\nVachris also pointed to future growth potential. For example, although only one new warehouse opened in the second quarter, more are planned for the rest of FY2025, with six sites opening this month. \u201cWe're projecting 28 new openings during fiscal year '25, of which three will be relocations for 25 net new buildings,\u201d he reported.\n\nAs more warehouses open, the leaders expect shoppers to remain mindful. \u201cWe believe that the member is probably as much focused now on quality, value and newness as they have been for quite some time. But they are still showing that willingness to spend, but they're being very choiceful where they're spending their dollars. And we think that's likely to continue and maybe even become more choiceful as the impact of some return of inflation and the potential impact of tariffs could flow through as well,\u201d Millerchip remarked. \u201cI'd say we're also seeing a continued sign of what I mentioned last quarter, where there's some indication that members are spending a little bit more on food at home versus food away from home overall.\u201d\n\nCostco is spending a bit more on its employees, too. Starting this month, workers\u2019 hourly rates will increase by $1 per hour to $30.20, with more $1 increases coming in each of the next two years.\n\nCostco currently operates approximately 900 warehouses, including 600-plus in the United States and Puerto Rico, 100-plus in Canada and 41 in Mexico.

It\u2019s the perfect place to decompress after a long day. Plus, getting a Solitude shed is much easier than knocking down walls in your home and starting a months-long renovation project . If you're worried about how it'll hold up to rain or snow, note that the roof is made from plywood treated with an ice and water shield, so you won't need to tear the whole thing down come winter.\n\nThe sheds range in size, from 10' by 12' to 16' by 16'.

News 13 requested notes from the meeting as part of an open records request.\n\nHere is what we know about the proposed project.\n\nThe proposed Costco will include 152,000 square feet. The parking lot plans include 839 parking spaces, a 4x4 fuel facility with 32 pumps and an out parcel for future development. There will be two onsite retention ponds on either end of the lots. It will also have a tire center that is only for tire changes.\n\nThe project will require an amendment to the existing conditional zooming, which requires approval by the city and county, and review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The amount of proposed parking exceeds the maximum allowed in the UDO and would either need to be reduced, included as a technical modification, or meet the standards for parking spaces above the maximum.\n\nTo develop the site, there are conditions under the current Conditional Zoning process which includes preserving the Enka Clock Tower along with interpretative signage of the American Enka Company and a seating/amenity area. There is also an easement for the proposed Hominy Creek Greenway along the western edge of the site that will need to be preserved.\n\nStaff during Wednesday\u2019s meeting encouraged the developers to reference the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, specifically the \u201cUrban Center\u201d future land use designation, to make the design and operational changes to the site that would enhance the project\u2019s compatibility. This could potentially include the following:\n\nSiting of the building on street frontages with human-scaled design elements\n\nSidewalks, paths and other amenities that enhance the pedestrian environment and safety\n\nBike lanes along the entrance drive\n\nConnection point and \u201ctrailhead\u201d to the proposed Hominy Creek Greenway\n\nThe \u201cUrban Center\u201d designation encourages a mixed-use style of development that is walkable and human-scaled, according to city information.\n\nSince the site currently lacks trees, Costco will also need to meet the 15% TCP requirement by planting new trees or paying a fee in lieu of planting of upwards of $875,000. For the site size, Costco would need 3.7 acres of trees to meet the requirements.\n\nDevelopers were also informed about how they will need to manage stormwater runoff.\n\nBecause of the size of the development, the North Carolina Department of Transportation must oversee a traffic impact study.\n\nWednesday's pre-application meeting was just the first step in the development process.\n\nBefore the developer can submit an application, according to the city\u2019s process outlined on Asheville\u2019s website, the developer must have a pre-application meeting and neighborhood meeting to notify property owners within 200 feet of the proposed development site.\n\nThe next step is the permit application and then the review process starts.\n\nNotes from Wednesday's meeting did not include a timeline for the project.",

The store will officially open at 8:00 a.m.\n\nThe retailer with stores across the Nation and Bay Area has eyed the City of Brentwood for some time. This new store will represent one of the City\u2019s largest sales tax generators. It will also serve as the first commercial development to break ground and open in the City\u2019s highly anticipated Innovation Center; a 260-acre town center development strategically situated along Highway 4 between Lone Tree Way and Sand Creek Road.\n\nMayor Susannah Meyer shared the following as it relates to Costco\u2019s effect on the city, \u201cThe arrival of Costco in Brentwood marks a significant milestone for the development of the Innovation Center at Brentwood. Costco is creating hundreds of good-paying jobs, boost our local economy, and generate millions in tax revenue to fund local improvements and community services, including public safety, road maintenance, and many other City services.\n\nCostco\u2019s new store provides well over 150,000 local residents of both Brentwood and our surrounding East Contra Costa County neighbors reduced travel times to Costco, decreasing traffic congestion and improving air quality. This store will also serve as a catalyst to attract new national retailers to the remaining four acre site adjacent to the store and continue to strengthen Brentwood\u2019s role as a leader in the East Contra Costa County shopping experience. The new store will also help foster a planned mixed-use development just south, along Heidorn Ranch Road as part of the Innovation Center.\n\nCity Manager Tim Ogden stated, \u201cBrentwood is excited to have Costco make a home here and offer great jobs for so many. The additional revenue to the City will continue to help maintain the high quality of life residents enjoy. Costco will also be a catalyst for more commercial development to follow in our Innovation Center @ Brentwood master planned community.\u201d\n\nThe City\u2019s Economic Development staff are pro-actively seeking a developer(s) to acquire and assemble approximately 25 acres just south of Costco and adjacent to a pedestrian and bicycle trail which will create a new town center. The town center will consist of townhomes and apartments with upwards of 100,000 square feet of retail and office development in a Main Street format. To learn more about this mixed-use development opportunity, please contact the City\u2019s Economic Development Team at https://www.brentwoodca.gov/business/economic-development.\n\nPrevious",

However, their average price target of $1,063 is just 3% above Thursday's intraday price.\n\nSecond Quarter Reflecting Membership Fee Hike\n\nThe quarter will mark the second since Costco's first membership fee bump in seven years went into effect in September. Executives have said that because of moves to raise employee wages and lower prices, the impact of the higher membership fees on margins will likely be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year and into fiscal 2026.\n\nEarlier this month, Costco said its comparable store sales for January rose 7.5% year-over-year, with a 9.2% jump in the U.S. and a 13.6% jump in online sales. For the full quarter, analysts expect the metric to come in at 6.6% growth from the same time last year.\n\nJPMorgan analysts said following the sales data release that executives suggested there were no one-time effects like tariffs or weather driving sales. That trend indicated that Costco \"continues to gain share while the consumer is better than they were last summer,\" the analysts wrote, calling the retailer's stock a \"core holding.\"\n\nCostco shares edged 1.5% lower in recent trading to $1,031.62 amid a broader market decline. They've gained over 30% over the past 12 months after hitting an all-time high on Feb. 13.\n\nUPDATE\u2014March 6, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.",

            "content": "Costco on Thursday reported an earnings miss, but beat expectations for revenue for the second quarter as quarterly comparable sales rose.\n\nShares ticked down over 1% in extended trading on Thursday evening.\n\nHere's how the wholesale company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 16, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $4.02 vs. $4.11 expected\n\n$4.02 vs. $4.11 expected Revenue: $63.72 billion vs. $63.13 billion expected\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris said although it's difficult to forecast the impact of tariffs, the company aims to minimize cost increases for members. A third of its U.S. sales are from imports, he said, and less than half of those come from China, Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"In uncertain times, our members have historically placed even greater importance on the value of high-quality items at great prices, and our teams will continue to rise to this challenge by leveraging our global buying power, strong supplier relationships and innovation,\" Vachris said.\n\nCiting tariff implications for groceries specifically, Vachris said margins are \"much tighter\" in that area, but that Costco will work with suppliers to mitigate the fallout for consumers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and doubled his tariff on China to 20% this week, though the White House said Thursday that the U.S. will exempt goods that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade until April 2. Retailers like Target and Best Buy have warned that tariffs would likely lead to price increases.\n\nCostco's second-quarter revenue increased 9% to $63.72 billion, from $58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024. Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1% to $62.53 billion, compared to $57.33 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nMembership fees for the quarter totaled $1.19 billion, up from $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders. Worldwide, Costco's membership renewal rate came in at 90.5%, an increase of 0.1% from last quarter.\n\nThe retailer raised its annual membership fees for the U.S. and Canada in September for the first time since 2017, though CFO Gary Millerchip said the impact of the increase on this quarter's fee total was only 3%.\n\nCostco reported a net income for the second quarter of $1.79 billion, or $4.02 per share, compared with a net income of $1.74 billion, or $3.92 per share, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nQuarterly comparable sales, which Costco defines as sales from warehouses and e-commerce sites open for more than a year, rose 6.8% year over year, compared with the StreetAccount estimate of 6.4%, and were up 8.3% in the U.S. Comparable sales for e-commerce rose 20.9% year over year.\n\nOn a monthly basis, comparable sales growth did fall from 7.5% in January to 6.5% in February. Extreme weather last month caused \"some hits here and there,\" Vachris said, but the company recovered most of that lost business.\n\nShopping traffic grew 5.7% year over year, with an increase of 5.6% in the U.S. The company's top sales categories included gold and jewelry, furniture, hardware and toys, all of which grew double digits year over year, according to Millerchip.\n\nConsumer behavior, Millerchip said, hasn't changed much over the past few quarters. Costco members are selective with the products they purchase, he said, and would become even more so if tariffs and inflation grow more significant.\n\n\"We believe that the member is probably as much focused now on quality, value and newness as they have been for quite some time, but they are still showing that willingness to spend,\" Millerchip said.\n\nCostco's fresh foods category experienced growth in the high single digits, Millerchip said. Continuing a trend from last quarter, sales of meat increased by double digits, Millerchip said, as consumers shifted toward lower-cost proteins like ground beef. Customers continued to spend more on food at home, he added.\n\nThe meat and bakery sections drove the fresh foods category to lead Costco's categories in inflation, though overall inflation was in the low single digits, he added.",

Here are 13 grocery item prices that are already rising at Costco due to the new tariffs.\n\nCanadian Beef\n\nThe U.S. is the largest importer of Canadian beef, so expect there to be less choice and higher prices in the Costco meat department. \"There's logistical challenges at the beginning,\" Jesse Witkowski, the founder of Deal Flow Xchange, tells NBC Boston. \"There's certainly going to be a slowdown of sorts temporarily in the supply chain. There will be some things that need to be figured out, but at the end of the day if costs are going up to produce something then they usually are passed on to the end consumer, and in this case they certainly will be.\"\n\nKirkland Tequila\n\nCostco carries imported alcohol like Kirkland tequila, which comes from the Santa Lucia distillery and could go up in price if the tariffs against Mexico go into effect next month. \"When I used to drink tequila, I tried Kirkland and compared it to a bunch of other ones, including some pretty expensive ones, e.g. $100 a bottle. Kirkland was my favorite,\" one Redditor said.\n\n7 Costco Kirkland Items Shoppers Say Have Gone Downhill\n\nFruit and Berries\n\nCostco's fresh berries could go up in price if the tariff's go into effect. In fact, berries come second only to avocados as Mexico's biggest produce export to the U.S. According to The Packer, 85% of total U.S. strawberry imports in 2022 came from Mexico.\n\nFlowers\n\nThe price of fresh-cut flowers in Costco could go up depending on how much they import from Canada, which exported $90 million in 2022, with $89.9M going to the U.S., according to OEC. \"I do think that when we look at our produce department, that's where we're going to see empty shelves,\" food industry analyst Phil Lempert told ABC7. \"The one other thing we do get from Canada is fresh cut flowers, so leading up to Valentine's Day, we might have a shortage of fresh cut flowers as well,\" says\n\nChocolate From Canada and Mexico\n\nThe U.S. imports a huge amount of chocolate from Canada (almost two billion USD in 2023 alone), and the second-highest chocolate imports to the U.S. come from Mexico, so Costco shoppers may find their favorite treats going up in price.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\nPork Products\n\nCostco meat department enthusiasts may notice the price of pork going up, as Canada exports millions of livestock and meat to the U.S. every year. \"It's the uncertainty of not knowing that forces you to completely rethink that (business) model,\" Ontario pig farmer Stewart Skinner, who sells 95% of his product to the U.S., tells Reuters. \"The market for our pigs is in the USA, not here in Canada.\"\n\nVegetable Oil\n\nThe U.S. imports a significant amount of cooking oil from Canada, so those giant Costco cans of oil may soon go up in price. \"The U.S was the largest export market for Canadian cooking oils (81.5% market share) valued at US$4.2 billion,\" according to Agriculture and Agri-food Canada.\n\nAvocados From Mexico\n\nThe U.S. imports 2.4 billion pounds of Mexican Hass avocados every year, according to the Produce Blue Book. Mexican avocados are a staple in Costco's grocery department. \"The new data validates the positive economic impact spurred by Americans' embrace of the fruit, the mutually beneficial relationship between our two countries, and the importance of maintaining strong trade ties,\" said Ron Campbell, Executive Director of the Mexican Hass Avocado Importers Association (MHAIA).\n\nCostco Food Court Just Made Major Change and Fans Say 'About Time'\n\nMexican Beer\n\nCostco sells popular Mexican beer brands such as Modelo and Corona, which are very popular in the U.S. \"The most popular beer brand in the entire country right now is Modelo,\" Malcolm Purinton, an assistant teaching professor of history at Northeastern University, tells Northeastern Global News. \"The thing is the demand isn't going to go away, but the costs are going to go up. \u2026 You'll see all the Mexican beers, also tequila, mezcal, any agave spirits, it's going to dramatically affect the costs of those.\"\n\nFresh Tomatoes\n\nGetting good quality fresh tomatoes from Costco could become a challenge, as the U.S imports most of its tomatoes from Mexico. \"The United States is Mexico's top tomato export market, with 1.82 MMT in exports valued at USD 2.7 billion in 2023, up by one percent in terms of volume and ten percent in value compared to 2022,\" says the USDA. \"Investments in greenhouse technology in recent years has enabled producers to deliver better quality products.\"\n\nMaple Syrup\n\nCanada is America's largest supplier of maple syrup, so expect prices for Costco's maple syrup to go up. \"It could mean the consumer [will decide] to use something else instead of the maple syrup,\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Dion, the president of the New Brunswick Maple Syrup Association, tells CBC. \"Certainly it's going to be a roller-coaster, another four-year roller-coaster, I think.\"\n\nCanadian Cookies and Cakes\n\nThe U.S exports a huge amount of confectionery from Canada, which could impact Costco cookie and chocolate prices. Not only that, but the U.S. also gets 15% of its raw sugar imports from Mexico, which could further affect grocery prices and availability.\n\nGas Prices\n\nEven filling up at a Costco gas station may not be the deal it usually is thanks to the trade war with Canada. \"What you are seeing is a great reshuffling of oil about to begin,\" analyst Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates tells CNN. \"You'll see something at the pump in the next five to seven days. Depending on where you are in the country, it could be up to another 15 cents a gallon.\"",

            "content": "Photo by AppHunters.io on Unsplash\n\nMarch 5, 2025\n\nCostco will be announcing its Q2 earnings on March 6. An early preview of these earnings suggests that the company has been experiencing strong growth, and some credit the company\u2019s DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) policy that flies in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive orders. Let\u2019s look at what we know.\n\nCostco Q2 Earnings Preview: Strong Growth, Possibly Good Stock Buy\n\nAccording to Seeking Alpha, one of Costco\u2019s most significant assets is its members\u2019 faith in the organization. Its revenues derive from membership fees, which provide a consistent and stable up-front income stream that Costco mostly reinvests to construct new warehouses without incurring debt.\n\nThe warehouse giant is a very conservatively run corporation with almost no debt and a large cash balance on its books. This business model also helped Costco avoid the problem of stealing. It is also a business where employees are satisfied with their jobs, customers believe they are getting excellent bargains, and shareholders see a company creating billions in free cash flow (FCF), which is subsequently given to them through regular dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the current expectation, the company\u2019s Q2 earnings (anticipated on March 6) will be quite favorable, with sales growth of roughly 8% and EPS increase of more than 10% year-over-year. Analysts predict declared revenues of $63 billion and earnings per share of $4.08. However, all eyes will be on the retention rate now that the membership cost increase has been implemented. If it remains above 92%, the few bears on Costco will most likely become invisible, while bulls may be encouraged.\n\nMAGA Boycott, But They Didn\u2019t Care\n\nPart of the reason investors are so bullish about the company is its uptick in membership following the threatened MAGA boycott. Donald Trump supporters were furious that the company refused to roll back its DEI policies following President Trump\u2019s executive orders all but barring the practices.\n\nDespite some retail executives suggesting that DEI was bad for the company, investors and shareholders clarified that Costco\u2019s core strength lies in its celebration of diverse cultures and ethnicities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEI initiatives were never intended to exclude qualified individuals from any group, but rather ensure that opportunities are awarded based on merit rather than historical biases. Their goal is to prevent unqualified candidates \u2014 regardless of background \u2014 from taking positions over equally or more qualified individuals. While concerns about reverse discrimination exist, studies, including one from Upstate Medical University, show that white women have been among the biggest beneficiaries of DEI policies.\u201d\n\nCostco has synthesized these realities of DEI and incorporated them into its own company practices. In a near-unanimous decision, the company refused to give in to pressures from reactionary conservative groups, and the decision paid off.\n\nShortly after its decision, Costco announced that it would increase its hourly pay rate for its employees to over $30 per hour.\n\nThe hike will begin with a $1 raise in the first year, increasing the rate to $30.20, followed by an extra $1 per year for the next two years, according to a corporate memo. Employees at the bottom of the pay range will get a compensation increase of 50 cents to $20. \u201cWith these changes, we believe our hourly wages and benefits will continue to far outpace others in the retail industry,\u201d the company stated in a memo signed by CEO Ron Vachris.\n\nThis pay increase followed a recent vote by Costco Teamsters union members in favor of a nationwide strike as they entered the last stages of contract negotiations before the Jan. 31 deadline. However, the strike was averted, at least for now, according to CNN, though full terms of the agreement were not available at the time.",

Partner Martin Lewis did not respond to a request for comment, but rumors have swirled about a possible Costco at the site for years.\n\nThe Watchdog reached out to Costco but did receive a response before publication.\n\nFletcher Partners bought the 200-acre site in 2008, when the Great Recession hit. The city of Asheville approved site plans, but development was slow to come.\n\nIn mid-February, Lewis; officials with Samet Corp., which just completed a large warehouse on the property and has two more buildings planned; and elected city and county officials attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for the warehouse and a bridge leading into the property. The bridge was started nearly a decade ago but just opened last month.\n\nJosh Drye, development manager with the Samet Corp., said at that ceremony that the company plans to start the second spec building when the first is 50 to 75 percent leased. That first building is ready for leasing.\n\nReached Tuesday, Drye declined to comment on a potential Costco. \u201cThat\u2019s not my project,\u201d he said.\n\nDrye referred The Watchdog to Samet\u2019s president of real estate, but he didn\u2019t respond by deadline.\n\nPlans on file with the city show the Costco situated on a 25-acre site within Enka Commerce Park, with 839 parking spaces. The plans also show the nearby historic Enka clock tower, which Samet has committed to preserving.\n\nA bridge into Enka Commerce Park off Smokey Park Highway recently opened. // Watchdog photo by John Boyle\n\nComing before the Technical Review Committee is an early step in a project\u2019s development. The eight-member body consists of six staff, a representative of the Urban Forestry Commission, and a member representing the Buncombe County Metropolitan Sewer District.\n\n\u201cAs proposed, the project would require a conditional zoning since it is over 100,000 square feet,\u201d Palmquist said. \u201cAfter the project is reviewed by the TRC, it would be reviewed by the Planning & Zoning Commission, and their recommendation would be forwarded to City Council for the final decision.\u201d\n\nThe TRC was established in 1997 for consideration of site plans, subdivision plats, master plans for Planned Unit Development, plans for conditional use permit or other land development matters consistent with the provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance, according to the city\u2019s website. \u201cThe members shall ensure that the proposed project complies with the development requirements and applicable City standards,\u201d the site states.\n\nCostco has more than 600 stores, or warehouses, in the U.S. The nearest Costco is in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and for years Asheville shoppers have made the 70-mile trek down I-26 to buy groceries in bulk.\n\nBuncombe County resident Evan Rosenberg said the development with Costco is \u201cAwesome news,\u201d as he\u2019s been making regular trips to the Costco store in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been Costco members for many years now, and when we moved from Maryland (about five years ago) we\u2019ve missed my regular pilgrimages to our favorite big box store,\u201d Rosenberg said via email. \u201cAnd it\u2019s even better news that the Enka Commerce Park will be only a few minutes away!\u201d\n\nAsheville Watchdog is a nonprofit news team producing stories that matter to Asheville and Buncombe County.

The company's sales and earnings numbers are nothing short of impressive, thanks at least partly to an advantaged business model. But does all of this make the stock a buy right now?\n\nWhat does Costco do?\n\nBefore getting into Costco's financial performance, it is important to understand the business. From a big-picture perspective it is a retailer, but when you dig into the model there's an important nuance. Indeed, Costco is a club store, which means customers pay a membership fee for the privilege of shopping in Costco's stores. This changes the dynamic dramatically.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2025, Costco generated roughly $2.2 billion in operating income. Membership fees generated nearly $1.2 billion in revenue. Membership fees don't have material costs associated with them, so most of that revenue just falls down to operating income. And that means that over half of Costco's operating income is directly attributable to the membership fees it collects.\n\nThe most important job Costco has is to keep its members happy since they are, effectively, an annuity-like income stream. With an over 90% renewable rate, the company is clearly doing that job well. But how does Costco achieve this? By offering good products at attractive prices. Those membership fees are helpful here, too, since that revenue allows the company to be aggressive (meaning it works hard to have low prices) when it comes to the prices it charges. Being an industry giant, with an over $460 billion market cap, helps there, as well, since it can be more demanding of its suppliers.\n\nCostco is a differentiated, and attractive, business and it is performing very well right now.\n\nCostco is hitting on all cylinders\n\nThe fiscal first quarter is the proof of Costco's model. The top line grew an impressive 7.5% with same store sales up a huge 5.2%. Earnings per share came in at $4.04 per share, up from $3.58 in the same quarter of the previous year. This is a very strong showing, noting that store traffic rose 5.1%. That basically means that Costco's membership fee-paying customers are happily coming back to buy even more from the company's stores.\n\nThere is a very good reason to like Costco as a business. There's just one problem for investors. Sometimes, as famed value investor Benjamin Graham liked to highlight, a good company can be a bad investment if you pay too much for it. It looks like Wall Street is well aware of how well Costco is doing today.\n\nThere are different ways to look at this issue. Just from the price chart, Costco is within 5% of its all-time highs. That has pushed the dividend yield down toward the low end of its historical range. Both of these facts hint at an expensive stock.\n\nUsing more traditional valuation metrics, Costco's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are both well above their five-year averages. That alone hints at a steep price, but there's another little wrinkle. When you look at historical graphs and the P/S and P/E ratios, you see that both are also near the highest levels in the company's history.\n\nBasically, when you examine Costco's valuation you can only come away with one take -- the stock is historically expensive. Yes, it is a good company, but it probably isn't a good stock to buy right now.\n\nBide your time with Costco\n\nJust because Costco is an expensive stock today doesn't mean it will always be an expensive stock. In fact, the stock has seen drawdowns of more than 40% multiple times in the past. So there's a chance that it could, someday, see a price decline that would make it a buy. But, right now, the best place for this advantaged retailer is probably on your wish list.",

And also, a treasure hunt atmosphere; there\u2019s always something new at Costco.\u201d\n\nFor more than a week, shoppers have stopped by the new warehouse, signing up for a membership, helping to propel the retailer forward in its mission to be a good community partner.\n\n\u201cWe want to be more than a retailer. We want to be a good neighbor and friend. We look forward to the quality jobs that we bring to the area as well as the economic impact,\u201d Mulholland said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to draw people in, and they\u2019re going to spend money, not only in Costco, but also in the community.\u201d\n\nThe new location has already made its impact on the local economy by hiring more than 100 workers with the possibility of adding more positions in the future as needed.\n\n\u201cWe have great employees, we offer great jobs, and it\u2019s wonderful to take care of our important members,\u201d Mulholland said.\n\nHe has already reached out to the United Way and Habitat for Humanity as part of the company\u2019s charitable work for the surrounding community.\n\nSubscribe to the TV5 newsletter and receive the latest local news and weather straight to your email every day.\n\nCopyright 2025 WNEM.

            "content": "Asheville Costco plans submitted. Could be be built near iconic Enka clock tower\n\nASHEVILLE - With the recent opening of a long-awaited bridge connecting Smokey Park Highway to Enka Commerce Park, a long-sought-after business may now be coming to the commercial district: Costco.\n\nThe city of Asheville will discuss plans to build a Costco at Enka Heritage Parkway during a March 6 Technical Review Committee pre-application meeting. A single page of development plans has been submitted to the city, indicating the wholesale company would build a new location on a nearly 40-acre parcel.\n\nThe pre-application meeting is not a guarantee that an application will be received by the developer proposing the company, City Principal Planner Will Palmquist told the Citizen Times. The project would need a conditional zoning, meaning that it would go before Asheville City Council. Plans were first reported by Asheville Watchdog.\n\nCostco currently operates 897 warehouses \u2014 617 of which are in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The company is well known for its offerings of bulk products, similar to Sam's Club.\n\nThe March 6 meeting is just a preliminary discussion. It's not a guarantee of a development submission.\n\n\"It allows for an informal dialogue between staff and the applicant on the sketch site plan. It is a required step prior to any formal submission,\" Palmquist said.\n\nCostco has been a long-rumored possible tenant for the site, which has been in the process of being redeveloped since 2008. In 2020, the Greensboro-based Samet Corp. began submitting plans for development in Enka, as the \"bridge to nowhere\" slowly made progress. The parcel was obtained by Samet in 2022.\n\nPreliminary plans sent to the city indicate that the Costco would include a fuel station, 839 parking spaces and would be built adjacent to the historic Enka clock tower. The Costco would be built off of Enka Heritage Parkway and the company has committed to preserving the clock tower.\n\nCostco does not comment on locations that are opening more than three months out, according to the company's website.\n\nThe bridge to Enka Commerce Park was opened on Feb. 12, capping a decade of investment from Buncombe County Board of Commissioners.\n\nThe Citizen Times has reached out to Samet Corp. for comment.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nWill Hofmann is the Growth and Development Reporter for the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA Today Network.

            "content": "It's easy to splurge at Costco, as it sells everything from top-grade meats to big-screen TVs and diamond engagement rings. However, most people who shop at Costco are there to stock up on reasonably priced items in bulk quantities. Once upon a time, under-$5 items at Costco were the norm. However, due to inflation over the last couple of years, you have to search harder to find steals at your local store. We took a trip to Costco this week and found 20 under-$5 steals that shoppers are stocking up on this week.\n\nOnions: $3.79\n\nOnions are a great item to stock up on at Costco. This bag, five pounds of Peruvian sweet onions, is currently just $4.49, averaging less than $1 per pound. Yellow onions are currently cheaper than sweet ones. The 5-pound bag is $3.79. Fun fact: Onions can last one to three months if stored properly, so don't worry about these going bad anytime soon.\n\nSweet Potatoes: $3.79\n\nSweet potatoes are on almost every nutritionist's must-eat list. The fibrous-root veggies can last up to three months if stored in the fridge. At $3.79 for five pounds, this bag will provide several meals and is perfect for weekly meal prep.\n\nElla Moss Cardigan: $5\n\nCostco is a great place to shop for bargain clothes. I was surprised to find this Ella Moss cardigan for just $5 in the clothing section. The ridiculously soft sweater is available in a few color options and feels and looks significantly more expensive than a bottle of super cheap wine.\n\n8 Most Surprising Items I Found at Costco This Week\n\nMixed Peppers: $4.39\n\nLots of diet and fitness influencers are fans of these hothouse-grown mini peppers. The bag is filled with colorful peppers, perfect for roasting, sauteeing, stuffing, or eating raw with a delicious dip. 1.5 pounds for $4.39.\n\nJose Garces Yucatan Marinated Chicken: $4.99\n\nWhile likely a regional item, as Jose Garces is a famed Philadelphia chef, I was shocked to find this ready-to-eat protein for under $5, currently half off at my local shop. For two pounds of precooked chicken, that is a total steal.\n\nTwo Baguettes: $4.99\n\nWhile there aren't tons of bakery items in the under-$5 range, there is one you shouldn't skip. Just one baguette is about $5 at most bakeries. At Costco, you get two for $4.99. Insider tip: Many Costo shoppers slice these up and freeze them so they can be enjoyed later.\n\nRotisserie Chicken: $4.99\n\nOne of the most popular items at Costco is their famous rotisserie chicken. Where else can you get a giant, tasty bird that can feed an entire family with leftovers for under $5?\n\nMushrooms: $3.59\n\nProduce is always reasonably priced at Costco and comes in handy when feeding a family. Right now, 24 ounces of white mushrooms costs $3.59. We also saw Baby Bella mushrooms for under $5.\n\nRomaine Lettuce: $4.39\n\nWhile bagged lettuce is clearly more convenient, Romaine lettuce is a better deal at the warehouse. Six lettuce heads for just $4.39? Who can pass up a produce buy like that?\n\nBlackberries: $3.49\n\nWhile blueberries and strawberries are a little over $5, for just $3.49, you can get a reasonably sized container of blackberries, perfect for smoothies.\n\n11 Costco Items Shoppers Say They'll \"Never Buy Again\"\n\nBaby Spinach: $4.29\n\nHealth influencers always stock up on spinach when they hit Costco. This one-pound container costs $4.29 and can be used for salads, sauteeing, and smoothie making.\n\nKirkland Water: $3.99\n\nAnother must-buy item at Costco I saw in almost everyone's cart? 40 bottles of Kirkland Signature purified water for $3.99. If you do the math, that is just 0.10 cents a bottle.\n\nMilk: $4.94\n\nIt's hard to find a gallon of milk for less than $5 anywhere. However, you can stock up for $4.94 a gallon at Costco. While Costco milk usually lasts long, my mom always buys and freezes a few. They stay suitable for up to three months if you freeze them sealed.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\nGoGurt: $4.59\n\nMy kids are big fans of GoGurt, currently on sale for $3 off, bringing the price down to just $4.59 for 4.5 pounds or 32 tubes. These can also be frozen and eaten as frozen yogurt or thawed later.\n\nBananas: $1.49\n\nIf you are a smoothie drinker, head to Costco weekly for bananas. You likely won't find a better deal anywhere else, as they sell for $1.49 for three pounds.\n\nWe Just Spotted These 7 Hidden Costco Deals\u2014But They Won't Last Long\n\nJus-Rol Pizza Crusts: $4.97\n\nCostco is known for selling some of the best frozen and fresh pizzas in town. However, if you are thinking about having a \"make your own pizza night,\" you can get a lot of bang for your buck with this box of four Jus-Rol Pizza Crusts for $4.97.\n\nLesser Evil Spaceballs: $4.99\n\nI am obsessed with Lesser Evil products, which I usually buy at Whole Foods. I was shocked to find this bag of healthified cheese balls (17 ounces) on sale for $4.99\n\nLike Air Puffcorn Cinnamon Bun: $3.99\n\nAnother organic snack is on sale this week. Like Air Organic Cinnamon Bun Puffcorn, currently $3.99 for 14 ounces. At just 50 calories per cup with no artificial ingredients, this gluten-free treat is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth.\n\nMorton Kosher Salt: $2.89\n\nWhile most items in the seasoning aisle are over $5, a 3.31-pound box of Morton Kosher Salt costs just $2.89 and is perfect for everything from brining meat to pickling veggies. You can also pick up a box of iodized salt for just $1.49 and sea salt for $3.39.\n\nCraize Crisps: $4.97\n\nCraize Crisps are thin, crispy sweet corn crackers inspired by the arepa. If you haven't tried them, pick up a bag for $4.97 and eat them on their own, with your favorite dip, or crumble them on a dish.",

            "content": "The first time I ever bought Maldon sea salt flakes was nearly two decades ago when I was following a chocolate chip cookie recipe that called for them. Once the dough was finished, the recipe instructed to portion it into balls, arrange them on a baking sheet and sprinkle the sea salt flakes over the top prior to baking.\n\nWhen the cookies came out of the oven, I let them cool slightly and then bit into one. It had a puddle of rich, melty chocolate; a sweet, buttery flavor; and a very welcome contrasting hint of saltiness and a little crunch from the sea salt flakes. I was hooked. I\u2019ve been making chocolate chip cookies\u2014and more\u2014with Maldon sea salt flakes ever since. I even travel with a small container of them, so I can add a little flavor to dishes in a pinch!\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve spent $10.95 on an 8.5-ounce box. So imagine my joy when I recently came across a 20.12-ounce tub of the shimmery, pyramid-shaped flakes at my local Costco for just $6.99. I immediately put one in my cart. It will take me a while to get through a tub of that size, even considering how often I use the flakes, but it will keep for years\u2014it is salt, a preservative, after all. To me, these tubs are an absolute steal.\n\nWhat Are Sea Salt Flakes?\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve likely noticed that salt comes in all shapes and sizes, ranging from the tiny table salt granules to larger kosher salt and sea salt flakes. There are even specialty salts out there, like fleur de sel and Himalayan pink salt. And chefs have strong opinions about which salts to use when.\n\nSea salt flakes are a finishing salt. You wouldn\u2019t want to, say, dump them into a pot of boiling water to season pasta\u2014that would be a waste\u2014and you wouldn\u2019t want to bake or cook with them, as they wouldn\u2019t add the right level of saltiness to your food (unless you did some amount conversions, but again it\u2019s kind of a waste to use them this way). What you do want to use them for is adding a much-needed bit of salt to something before serving.\n\nHow Do I Use Sea Salt Flakes?\n\nAfter reading that, you might be thinking that sea salt flakes sound so cheffy and fancy, but I promise you there are plenty of everyday uses for them. The simplest, and perhaps my favorite, is that you can just sprinkle the sea salt flakes (be sure to crumble them as you sprinkle) on softened or whipped butter and spread it on fresh bread. It\u2019s a match made in heaven. I\u2019ll also often drizzle toast with olive oil and sprinkle some flakes on top. Here are some other ways to use the flakes.\n\nAvocado toast. Expanding on my love of toast with olive oil and sea salt flakes, I\u2019ll also make my avocado toast with the flakes. I just toast a nice piece of sourdough or a seedy whole-grain bread, spread sliced avocado on top, drizzle on some olive oil, grind a little pepper over it and sprinkle the sea salt flakes on top. If you haven\u2019t tried this, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a nice way to perk up everyday avocado toast. This works with things like cottage cheese toast too.\n\nExpanding on my love of toast with olive oil and sea salt flakes, I\u2019ll also make my avocado toast with the flakes.

Just crumble and sprinkle a few on top, and it will instantly make that grilled cheese taste a whole lot better (not that a grilled cheese could ever really be bad).\n\nHave you ever made a grilled cheese sandwich and felt like it was good, but it could use a little something?

Any sort of salad that\u2019s thoughtfully prepared and arranged could likely benefit from some sea salt flakes. I\u2019m talking about something like a caprese salad with its layers of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella. I\u2019ll usually drizzle some good-quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil on top and then sprinkle on the sea salt flakes. They help bring everything together. The sea salt flakes are even a nice addition to a citrus salad.\n\nAny sort of salad that\u2019s thoughtfully prepared and arranged could likely benefit from some sea salt flakes.

This past Christmas, I made a beef tenderloin, and after I had sliced and plated up the perfectly pink meat, my brother looked at it and suggested that it needed some finishing salt. He was right. I dug through the bin of kitchen stuff I\u2019d brought to my parents\u2019 house for the holidays and found my travel container of sea salt flakes. The little crystals were the perfect touch, adding not just to the appearance but to the overall taste.

They might sound fancy, but you can use them in everyday applications. And, hey, if that makes your dishes seem more fancy, I say just own it and accept all the compliments that come your way. I love these little flakes so much that I always have them on hand in my own kitchen, but I also bring them with me on vacations where I know we\u2019ll have a kitchen and be cooking or when I go to my parents\u2019 house for the holidays, where I know I\u2019ll be in charge of making a caprese wreath and a roast beef tenderloin. If you can find them at your local Costco, I encourage you to invest in a tub. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find myriad uses for it.\n\n",

            "content": "The warehouse club giant has an important financial update on Thursday.\n\nIt may not always be a bull market, but for Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) investors it's always a bulk market. The country's leading warehouse club operator has been a consistent wealth creator, a 400-bagger since going public 32 years ago. Success is measured in decades, not quarters. However, shareholders should still pay attention when Costco steps up with fresh financials this week.\n\nThe iconic chain will report its fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday, shortly after the market close. The shares have been resilient lately. Costco is trouncing the market with a 14% gain this young year against a surprisingly flattish S&P 500 through the first two months of 2025 trading. It has risen by more than 40% over the past year. Expectations are reasonable, but Costco may have to perform better than that to keep its recent upticks.\n\nYou don't need a Costco membership to enter into this financial preview. Let's go take a look around.\n\nHoping to stick the Kirk-landing\n\nWall Street pros see revenue rising 8% to hit $63 billion for the 12-week period ending in mid-February. The bottom-line forecast is even more modest. Analysts are modeling a profit of $4.10 a share, less than a 5% year-over-year increase. Costco has landed ahead of the market's quarterly profit targets over the past year, but they have all been just single-digit percentage beats.\n\nThe market tends to have a good read on Costco -- at least on the top line -- because the retail stocks bellwether puts out monthly updates for the first two months of a reporting period. Costco has already said that total sales rose 9.2% in December, accelerating to a 9.9% jump in January. Domestic comps also stayed north of 9% in each of those reports, with e-commerce sales clocking higher and its international performance languishing relative to its home market. Will February be bad enough to drag fiscal second-quarter sales down to the 7.8% increase that analysts are projecting?\n\nWhat about the bottom line? Analyst estimates have been inching higher since the last financial update. Wall Street pros went from eyeing a quarterly per-share profit of $4.01 three months ago to $4.05, $4.07, and now $4.10 in the subsequent months. Food retail has seen some inflationary spikes in products including eggs and coffee, but Costco has a track record of managing the ups and downs of retail pricing. It would also be ironic if margins are getting squeezed after Costco pushed out a $5 to $10 increase for its annual membership plans in September.\n\nThe increase itself isn't likely to have rattled Costco's rolls. Increasing its entry-level Gold Star plan from $60 to $65 and its business-geared Executive tier from $120 to $130 is actually less than many bulls expected. It's the smallest increase on a percentage basis of the eight hikes it has pushed out since opening its doors back in 1983. It had also been seven years since the last membership boost, the longest gap between hikes that had previously happened between two and six years apart.\n\nThe model just works\n\nCostco serves its customers with thin markups. Membership fees account for roughly 2% of its total sales, but with a trailing net margin of 2.9% the memberships translate into the lion's share of its bottom line. An increase -- even a lower-than-expected one -- should materially boost its profitability.\n\nThe chain earned $4.04 a share in its fiscal first quarter, its first full financial period with the new pricing in place. Analysts were only holding out for a profit of $3.80 a share. This should be yet another earnings beat for Costco, unless the operating landscape for warehouse club operators soured faster than the market is currently modeling for.\n\nCostco can't afford a miss. The stock isn't cheap at 57 times this fiscal year's net income projection or even 52 times fiscal 2026's target. The shares have outpaced the fundamentals over the past year, but the same can be said for even longer stretches of time. Costco has earned the right to a hefty market premium. It has earned its all-weather stripes. There was only one year -- a 1.5% decline in fiscal 2009 during the Great Recession -- in which Costco didn't deliver positive top-line growth in its more than three decades of public trading. CEO Ron Vachris has only been at the helm for a year now, but he's a Costco lifer who began working at the company as a forklift operator 40 years ago -- the chain hasn't skipped a beat in the handoff.\n\nBetting against Costco because the stock isn't as cheap as its value proposition for members hasn't paid off for the naysayers in the past. Costco should be able to prove its worth to the market on Thursday afternoon, too.",

            "content": "5% price move projected as the stock trades near all-time highs\n\nCostco reports quarterly earnings Thursday, after the stock market closes, and the stock could split soon, making it more affordable.\n\nThe company is expected to report earnings-per-share of $4.08 on $63.03 billion in revenue.\n\nThe chain will continue to lean on high membership renewal rates and store expansion plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nCostco (COST) will report quarterly earnings after the market closes Thursday, and the stock price is trading near all-time highs at around $1,050 per share. The wholesaler will look to continue posting strong earnings figures for the quarter, and many investors are wondering whether we'll see a stock split.\n\nThe company is expected to report earnings-per-share (EPS) of $4.08 on $63.03 billion in revenue. It has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row but has had a spotty revenue estimate record, missing half of the reports in the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, Costco released its January sales report, and the numbers looked good\u2014a net increase of 9.2% compared to last year. While inflation and stagflation worries remain high, consumers will always look to pinch pennies where they can. The company offers that to consumers by way of bulk purchasing everyday items.\n\nA not-so-surprising fact about Costco is the membership retention rate, which is over 90%. That means when people sign up, they don't usually leave. Combine that with an effort to continue expanding internationally and domestically, and you've got yourself a nice sustainable business model.\n\nOn the last earnings call, Costco reported a 7.8% membership income growth rate along with a 90.4% global membership renewal rate. Three new stores were built in the U.S. and Canada, with another three built internationally. Costco estimates its 890 stores will grow to 916 by the end of FY \u201925.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the implied volatility of the options market enables us to see how options prices reflect the uncertainty of the binary event that is Costco's earnings announcement this week. Surprisingly, there is only a +/- 5% stock price move projected for this earnings call. The implied stock price move is +/- $44.05 from the current price of $1,050 per share.\n\nThat puts Costco on the lower end of the implied volatility range for most companies that reflect around 5%-10% of the notional value of the stock price. Low implied volatility means the market isn't projecting anything too crazy to happen with COST stock, regardless of whether the report is good or bad.\n\nLooking to options cycles later this year, we see the April options cycle has a +/- $69.20 expected stock price range. That tells us that even though the overall implied volatility for Costco earnings is low, this week's implied movement still accounts for over 60% of the implied price range over the next 45 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullish on Costco stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on COST stock for earnings, you're looking for continued strength in EPS and revenue figures for last quarter. With the stock trading near all-time highs, it seems necessary for a double earnings beat if we're to see the stock soar to new highs. Costco exhibits very low implied volatility for this earnings call, which means the market isn't expecting anything too surprising. Some might say this creates some stability around the current stock price, but we've seen crazy things happen during earnings announcements before. I'm speculating on a stock split announcement at some point this year, and if that happens we could see the market react favorably to the news.\n\n\n\n\n\nBearish on Costco stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bearish on COST stock for earnings, you're looking for some weakness in the forecast for 2025, an EPS miss, revenue miss or a combination of all three factors. Costco is a strong brand with strong consumer confidence, so it would really take something rattling to see the stock drop in a dramatic way this week.\n\nTune in to Options Trading Concepts Live at 11 a.m. CST on Thursday for some options trading strategy ideas ahead of earnings announcements after the market closes from Costco and Broadcom (AVGO).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Butler, tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

            "content": "Some people make their weekly Costo run a couple's date night, while others, including single moms like me, carve out the time as an unconventional form of \"me time.\" During my most recent expedition, I noticed lots of new products, great deals, and even really surprising items at my local warehouse. From designer rugs and highly rated ice makers to my favorite healthy sweet treats, here are 8 of the most surprising items I found at Costco this week.\n\nYasso Greek Yogurt Bars\n\nMy daughter and I are obsessed with Yasso Greek Yogurt bars, a guilt-free version of an ice cream bar that fitness pros and nutrition experts endorse as a healthier alternative. I usually buy them at Whole Foods, where they retail for about $1.75 a bar. However, my Costco now carries a 15-pack of cookies and cream for just $11.99 \u2013 just 0.80 cents a bar!\n\nFrigidaire Gallery Ice Maker\n\nI was over at my friend's house the other day, and she had just purchased a Frigidaire Gallery Ice Maker on Amazon for $250. \"I did lots of research and it's the best one for the price,\" she told me. While perusing my store's aisles, I spotted the same one for $199.99 \u2013 $50 less than at other stores. I immediately tossed it in my cart and have been enjoying crunchy little ice pellets (identical to Chick-fil-A ones) all week.\n\n11 Costco Items We Saw in Almost Every Shopper's Cart Today\n\nRuggable Rugs\n\nRuggable rugs are incredible but, honestly, quite expensive. I've seen off-brand alternatives at Costo, but during this trip, I noticed actual Ruggable branded ones, and they were indeed a steal. While patterns were limited, they were less than half off \u2013 just $299 for an 8\u00d710 rug, compared to $659 and up on the website.\n\nPost Malone Oreo and Double-Stuffed Variety Pack\n\nPost Malone's Oreo partnership was one of the most unexpected. However, I was delighted to find a variety pack of 15 packs of the rapper's unique flavor alongside 25 Oreo Double Stuffed Cookies for $13.99. My son and I are obsessed with the limited-edition salted caramel and shortbread-flavored creams, sandwiched in between a chocolate and golden cookie.\n\nBobo's PB&J Sandwiches\n\nAnother Whole Foods find now available at Costco? Bobo's PB&J Sanwiches. The delicious vegan and gluten-free treats made with whole grains and pronounceable ingredients generally average to about $1 per sandwich. However, Costco's variety pack is selling 20 for $11.59 \u2013 which averages about 0.57 cents each.\n\nGodiva Spring Box\n\nGodiva is one of my favorite chocolatiers on the planet. The gourmet chocolate isn't cheap, but it's affordable at Costco. My store was stocked with the Godiva Spring Box, retailing for $17.99. It comes with various popular pieces, like Midnight Swirl, Milk Chocolate Creme Puff, Milk Chocolate Hazelnut Heaven, Milk Chocolate Almond Caramel, Dark Chocolate Lava Cake Truffle, and more.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\n7 Costco Items That Have Gotten 'Way More Expensive,' Say Shoppers\n\nPurple PurpleRenew 11-Inch Gel Grid Mattress\n\nI have been writing about mattresses for decades. One of the most popular and comfortable I have slept on is Purple, with its superior \"Gelflex Grid\" technology. The brand has an exclusive mattress that sells at Costo, and it's just $899 right now for a Queen-size and $1099 for King. While they don't sell the exact same model on their website, if they did, it would probably retail for at least double.\n\nTake and Bake Roman Style Pizza\n\nCostco is famous for not only selling delicious frozen pizza but take-and-bake as well. They recently introduced a new Take and Bake Roman Style Pinsa Pizza, with a thicker crust in a rectangular shape. While it might seem pricey for a Costco pizza at $17.99, the pie is huge and Redditors confirm it is \"worth every penny\" and \"fabulous and worth it.\"",

The spit-roasted birds are great to have on hand when you don't feel like doing the whole cooking rigamarole. There isn't much to crack in terms of the whole bird's appeal with shoppers. Tender, fall-off-the-bone meat, a golden skin that crackles and shines. They're simply handy for on-the-fly dinners or as short-cuts to quick enchiladas or stews, and the price\u2014 oh boy, the price \u2014 is a downright bargain at just five bucks.\n\nCostco formally hit the scene in 1983, and in about a decade, the retailer would begin hawking the spit-roasted delicacies on a permanent basis, where they've stayed in the rotation ever since. Just in 2023, card carriers took home 137 million chickens \u2014 20 million more than the year prior \u2014 so it seems doubtful customers will stop flocking to the meal prep staple anytime soon.\n\nPlanning how to shred and chop the poultry to its potential is just half the story behind the best-selling bird. What prompted Costco's move into the chicken business? Who came up with the idea to sell them? Why are they so inexpensive? There's a lot more than longtime members might know, and the dozen tidbits we've laid out here are proof.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), AT&T Inc. (T) and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC), as well a micro-cap stock Air T, Inc. (AIRT). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+62.9% vs. +48.9%). The company remains focused on business transformation efforts to augment operational efficiency and facilitate the optimum utilization of resources to enhance value. Solid 5G traction and fiber subscriber growth are key growth drivers.\n\n\n\nAT&T has collaborated with Microsoft to move its 5G mobile network to the latter\u2019s cloud. This will enable the company to enhance productivity and deliver large-scale network services to meet customers\u2019 needs. Collaboration with Nokia to streamline network services, improve automation and accelerate deployment timelines is a positive factor.\n\n\n\nHowever, intensifying competition in a highly saturated wireless market will likely impact profits. The steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services is a potent headwind. Healthy discounts and freebies to woo customers dent margins.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\n\n\n\nMarsh & McLennan\u2019s shares have gained +15% over the past year against the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry\u2019s gain of +34.6%. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates. Marsh & McLennan is well-positioned for growth due to strategic acquisitions, new product launches and diversification into emerging markets. Its $7.75 billion McGriff acquisition is expected to significantly expand its middle-market reach.\n\n\n\nMMC\u2019s revenues have surged owing to its broad geographic presence, robust client retention and the solid performance of the Risk and Insurance Services unit. Strong cash flow supports its ongoing investments and impressive dividend increases. The company also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\n\n\nHowever, rising operating costs due to higher compensation and benefits are likely to impact margins. Its debt-laden balance sheet and lower investment income are concerns. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marsh & McLennan here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Air T have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry over the past year (+8.5% vs. -9.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $47.19 million reported a 22.2% revenue increase to $77.9 million in third-quarter fiscal 2025 from $63.8 million in the prior-year quarter, with growth across all core segments.\n\n\n\nOvernight Air Cargo revenue rose 5.4% to $30.6 million, Ground Equipment Sales surged 40.3% to $11.8 million and Commercial Jet Engines & Parts grew 35.4% to $32.7 million. Operating income improved to $1.8 million from a $1.6 million loss, while adjusted EBITDA reached $2.7 million against a loss of $0.1 million in the year-ago period. Contrail Aviation remains a key growth driver, benefiting from aftermarket demand.\n\n\n\nHowever, risks include $105.4 million in debt, rising interest costs, reliance on FedEx, liquidity pressures and cyclical aviation headwinds. A third-quarter fiscal 2025 net loss of $1.3 million raises concerns about earnings sustainability.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Air T here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Marvell Technology, Inc.

Costco Executive members can earn 2% in rewards on qualifying Costco purchases, including Costco Travel.\n\nCostco Travel\n\nCostco Travel is an online travel agency available to Costco members only. It offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, rental cars, and theme park and specialty bookings. Interestingly, you can\u2019t book a flight through Costco Travel unless it\u2019s included in a vacation package.\n\nYou can access Costco Travel by selecting Travel on the Costco website or by visiting costcotravel.com.\n\nCostco Travel is only available to Costco members.

Searching for a vacation package works like any other online travel agency you may be familiar with. First, you need to input your travel destination, number of travelers, dates, and departure city.\n\nThe search results list, which defaults to Costco recommendations first, is easily filtered and sorted to find exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe total package price is displayed along with any included extras, such as a Costco digital shop card.\n\nAfter choosing a package, click on View Deals & Customize. You can see what\u2019s included in the package and select different flights or choose an upgraded room. The cost of your package automatically adjusts based on your choices. Remember that the price and extras, such as the Costco shop card that comes with many travel packages, may change as you alter your options.\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to choose different flights and hotel rooms. Notice the Costco shop card value may change based on your choices. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nOnce you finalize the details of your Costco Travel package, you can select whether you want just to pay a deposit or pay for the entire trip. Payments can be made with a Visa or Mastercard. American Express cards aren\u2019t accepted.\n\nHot Tip: While only Visa cards are accepted in Costco stores, you can pay for a Costco Travel package using a Visa or a Mastercard.\n\nPrice Comparisons\n\nWe wanted to see how Costco Travel vacation package prices stacked up, so we checked out a few options. These examples include a 7-night package for 2 people, including hotel accommodations and flights.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Package Cost on Costco Travel Cost if booked separately Cost on Expedia Iberostar Grand Bavaro $6,469.56 (includes airport transfers and a $379 Costco shop card) $7,006.36 $7,125.50 Live Aqua Cancun All-Inclusive $5,080.76 (includes airport transfers and a $269 Costco shop card) $7,213.45 $5,130.91 Le Meridien Barcelona $4,994.74 $4,535.71 $3,874.14\n\nCostco Travel offered the best packages for the first 2 examples. Not only was the package price the lowest, but Costco\u2019s packages also included airport transfers and Costco shop cards, making them an even sweeter deal.\n\nHowever, the third package illustrates that Costco Travel isn\u2019t always the best option. In this example, Costco Travel was the most expensive. However, it included a daily breakfast buffet and a walking food tour. The cheapest option was Expedia, but that package was completely nonrefundable, which may not be worth the savings for some travelers.\n\nVacation Package Included Activities\n\nOne thing to look out for when booking a vacation package through Costco Travel is that they sometimes include extras that you don\u2019t really want. If you remove these extras, the price drops, but some packages require you to add an activity.\n\nFor example, this European vacation package included a walking food tour in the quoted price.\n\nThis \u201cincluded\u201d activity actually costs quite a bit. Thankfully, it can be taken out of the package. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nAfter tour was removed, the price dropped by $582.44! That\u2019s a huge price to pay for a walking tour, and it would have been easy to assume it was a part of the package when, in reality, it cost a lot extra.\n\nThis \u201cincluded\u201d activity actually costs over $500! Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nThe bad news is that some vacation packages don\u2019t let you to opt out of an activity. In this example, there were 5 activity options available ranging in price from $582 to $1,590.\n\nThis can add a lot of unnecessary costs to a Costco Travel vacation package.\n\nBottom Line: Costco Vacations travel packages include a hotel plus a flight and/or rental car. These packages often offer tremendous savings over booking through other websites or booking each element separately. However, Costco Travel won\u2019t always offer the lowest price, so it\u2019s good to shop around a bit before booking any vacation package.\n\nCostco Hotels\n\nSearching for a hotel through Costco Travel works just like any other online travel agency you may be familiar with. However, the options for booking a hotel without a vacation package are limited.\n\nTo begin, click on the Hotels tab on the Costco Travel website and then enter the city, dates, number of people, and the number of rooms.\n\nResults appear on the next screen, with options to filter the list by a specific hotel, hotel chain, area, amenities, member reviews, and ratings. The results list can be sorted by price, but you only see prices if you enter your Costco number.\n\nYou can easily filter and sort your results list. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nRemember that when you book a hotel through Costco Travel, you aren\u2019t eligible to earn hotel loyalty points, nor will the hotel recognize any elite status you have. If you\u2019re loyal to a particular hotel chain, such as Hyatt, Hilton, or Marriott, it\u2019s important to weigh any savings against the benefits and points you\u2019d give up.\n\nAfter selecting a hotel, you can choose a different room, and the price will adjust automatically.\n\nYou can choose an upgraded room through Costco Travel. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nPayment options and cancellation policies can vary based on the hotel and rate you choose, so be sure to read the fine print carefully before you book.\n\nPrice Comparisons\n\nWe priced out a couple of hotel stays to see if Costco Travel offered competitive pricing. We found examples of Costco\u2019s price being both higher and lower than the hotel website\u2019s price. You may be able to find a great deal, but it\u2019s not guaranteed.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Hotel Price on Hotel\u2019s Website Price on Costco Travel InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile $281.84 $268.40 Grand Hyatt Seattle $296.63 $302.63\n\nBottom Line: There are a limited number of hotels you can book through Costco Travel unless you\u2019re booking a package. You may find there are no options even in popular cities and vacation spots, so it can be frustrating to book a stand-alone hotel through Costco Travel.\n\nCostco Cruises\n\nLike many online travel agencies, Costco offers deals, perks, and specials when booking cruises. Sometimes, these can be quite valuable, but as always, it pays to shop around.\n\nIf you know more or less what you want, it\u2019s easy to search for cruises on Costco Travel. Just go to the home page, click the Cruises tab, and enter your destination, departure month, specific cruise line (if you have a preference), and duration.\n\nYou can book a cruise through Costco Travel. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nYou can also select an option to search for Alaska cruise tours, which combines a cruise voyage and a guided land tour before or after the voyage.\n\nThe results page lists every matching available cruise, with options to filter and sort the results. Each result shows the available room types and any included extras, such as a Costco Cash Card (gift card), onboard credit, or discount.\n\nHot Tip: The price listed in Costco Travel\u2019s cruise search results is per person and doesn\u2019t include taxes and fees.\n\nOne of the downsides of using Costco Travel to search for a cruise is that you can only search for 1 month at a time. While other cruise booking websites allow you to search by year or any combination of months, Costco Travel requires you to pick a specific month to travel.\n\nWhen you find the right cruise, you can select your stateroom type, the number of people joining, and even the specific room location. You can also choose to add flights and pre- or post-cruise hotels to a package.\n\nHot Tip: Some cruise lines offer their own credit card with cruise rewards, but a more general travel rewards card like The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express almost always offers a better value. For more information, check out our full guide to the best credit cards for booking cruises.\n\nCostco Travel Cruise Deals\n\nYou can browse available deals, packages, and popular options if you aren\u2019t set on a specific cruise, date, or region. You find these options by scrolling down on the Costco Travel cruise page, where you can explore by destination, category (such as last-minute cruises or luxury cruises), departure port, or cruise line.\n\nYou can explore multiple cruise options for inspiration. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nPrice Comparisons\n\nWe priced out cruises on Costco Travel and the cruise lines\u2019 websites and found that the cost was usually lower with Costco Travel, especially considering they all came with Costco shop cards.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Cruise Cruise line\u2019s website Costco Travel 3-night cruise on Royal Caribbean $868.96 $727.96 + $25 Costco shop card 7-night cruise on Celebrity $1,391.42 $1,359.42 + $25 Costco shop card 11-night cruise on Norwegian $2,264.62 $2,264.62 + $70 Costco shop card\n\nHowever, getting accurate pricing on a cruise can be tricky. For example, for the Norwegian cruise, the cost was higher on Norwegian\u2019s website initially, but that\u2019s because it included Free at Sea promotions. With those removed, the cost was the same. Booking through Costco came with a $70 shop card but didn\u2019t give you the ability to add the Free at Sea promotions (which could be very valuable for some guests).\n\nIn our research, we\u2019ve found that most cruise booking websites offer the same (or very similar) pricing. The difference is in the extras offered, like a Costco shop card, drink packages, or shipboard credit.\n\nIt\u2019s always smart to price out a cruise on multiple websites, and Costco Travel could be a great place for Costco members to start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostco Car Rentals\n\nCostco Travel also includes a stand-alone car rental booking feature in addition to letting you rent a car as part of a vacation package.\n\nUnlike some other online travel agencies that offer just about everything under the sun, Costco sticks with 4 big car rental agencies: Alamo, Avis, Budget, and Enterprise.\n\nIf you would prefer to get your rental from another company like Hertz or Dollar, you should book directly or use a more inclusive portal like AmexTravel.com or Orbitz.\n\nHot Tip: When renting a car, be sure to use a credit card that comes with car rental insurance. You\u2019ll need to decline the rental company\u2019s collision or loss damage waiver (CDW/LDW) for the credit card insurance to be active. Some of our favorite options, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, include primary coverage.\n\nSearching and Booking\n\nTo search for a rental car, input the pickup and drop-off locations, dates, and times, and then click Search.\n\nSearch results are shown in a grid, with the 4 companies as the columns and the various classes of cars available as the rows. The lowest prices for each type of car are shown in red, and the price includes taxes and fees. You can click on any price to see the terms and conditions for that rental.\n\nThe lowest price for each type of car will be shown in red. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nPrice Comparisons\n\nWe did some price comparisons using the metasearch engine Kayak, and we always found lower prices on rental cars through other websites.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Costco will never have the best price, however. Car rental prices fluctuate, so it\u2019s always best to price out your rental on multiple websites before booking.\n\nCostco Theme Parks and Specialty Vacations\n\nCostco Travel also offers the ability to book select theme parks and specialty vacations.\n\nAdventures by Disney\n\nAulani, A Disney Resort and Spa\n\nBrendan Vacations Ireland & Scotland\n\nContiki\n\nCostsaver\n\nDisney Cruise Line\n\nDisneyland (vacation packages) Evan Evans Britain\u2019s Finest Sightseeing Tours\n\nInsight Vacations\n\nLion World Travel (African safaris)\n\nLuxury Gold\n\nTrafalgar Worldwide Guided Vacations\n\nWalt Disney World (vacation packages)\n\nTo book a theme park or specialty vacation package through Costco Travel, you first choose the package type you\u2019re looking for.\n\nYou can book specialty vacation packages through Costco. Image Credit: Costco Travel\n\nThen, you can see each package\u2019s inclusions and details. Each vacation package includes different components, so it\u2019s important to read the details carefully.\n\nPricing information isn\u2019t displayed until all package components are selected, so it can be a bit tricky to search based on your vacation budget.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFor Costco members, using the retailer\u2019s travel service can present an opportunity to save some cash on an incredible vacation. Through negotiated rates with hotels, tour providers, and more, Costco can sometimes offer generous discounts or great added perks.\n\nAs always, make sure to compare prices and read all terms. While Costco may offer a price advantage for one service, another portal might win for something else, while direct booking may be the best option for yet another aspect of your travel.\n\nLastly, if you plan to book a vacation package through Costco and have a Gold Star membership, you might want to consider upgrading to an Executive Membership for an extra $65 a year. The extra 2% rewards could make the upgrade well worth it.\n\nLike this post? Pin it on Pinterest!",

            "content": "One part of owning Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) that many investors overlook is the dividend. That may seem surprising since its payout has risen annually since its introduction in 2004. Also, the company will periodically reward its shareholders with special dividends, the most recent of which was a $15-per-share payout in January 2024.\n\nNonetheless, the decision to buy a stock almost always hinges on more factors than its dividend, even for those who invest primarily for income. Hence, investors need to evaluate both the payout and the overall value proposition of the stock to make such a determination.\n\nThe Costco dividend\n\nCurrently, Costco pays its shareholders $4.64 per share in dividends. Additionally, it is a dividend the company can easily afford.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Nov. 24, 2024), Costco generated about $2.2 billion in free cash flow and made dividend payments of $515 million. Thus, it can not only cover the dividend but also afford considerable payout hikes.\n\nUnfortunately, the appeal of the dividend tends to drop significantly when one finds the dividend yield is only 0.4%. This is far below the S&P 500 average of 1.25%.\n\nMoreover, in 2024, a year that included a special dividend and a payout hike in the spring, shareholders earned $19.50 per share in dividend income. Still, when compared to the current share price, that takes the yield to less than 1.9%.\n\nIn comparison, Walmart's current dividend yield is 0.9%, while Target's payout returns 3.5% to shareholders. Since both do not include special dividends, it shows how little a Costco shareholder makes from the dividend yield.\n\nBut what about the stock?\n\nAdmittedly, many long-term shareholders may feel like they have good reason to dismiss the dividend when pondering the investment thesis. Costco stock is up by over 40% last year not including the payout, which far exceeds the total returns of the S&P 500.\n\nThat has occurred under a steady but relatively slow expansion. As of the end of fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1, 2024), Costco operated 890 warehouses worldwide, 31% of which are outside of the U.S. The company also plans to open an additional 29 locations in fiscal 2025, and renewal rates run at around 91% globally, a testament to the store's enduring popularity.\n\nIts growth has taken the P/E ratio to 62, an all-time high for its earnings multiple. Also, Costco has successfully grown revenue under a variety of economic conditions. Hence, it is likely not surprising that in fiscal 2024, net income of $7.4 billion, a 17% yearly increase, and profits rose 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nStill, investors may balk at its valuation as analyst's fiscal 2025 profit forecasts predict only 13% annual profit growth. With the forward P/E ratio of 58, that current rate of net income increase arguably does not justify its current multiple.\n\nIf investors agree, Costco stock could suffer a significant pullback, and the 0.4% dividend yield will likely not be much consolation to its shareholders if that happens.\n\nShould I add Costco stock to my portfolio?\n\nUnder current conditions, both income and growth investors should probably not add shares of Costco stock.\n\nAdmittedly, Costco likely fits the definition of a dividend stalwart. Its payout has risen for 21 straight years, and the special dividends serve as welcome bonuses to its shareholders.\n\nNonetheless, the dividend is likely too small to be a factor in this stock except for its longest-term shareholders. At a yield of 0.4%, the retail stock will probably not attract income investors, especially when its peer Target offers shareholders dividend growth with almost 9 times as much yield.\n\nAdditionally, growth investors may question whether they want to buy at current levels. Its P/E ratio is at an all-time high at 62, and income growth in the low double digits is probably not enough to justify that earnings multiple.\n\nUltimately, Costco remains one of the world's most successful retailers, and the company's business and financials indicate it will remain strong. However, between the low dividend yield and high valuation, investors can probably earn higher returns in other retail stocks.",

While stock varies by location, one thing is for sure: Many products will disappear from store shelves as spring approaches.\n\nTake a look at the top six items to buy at Costco before they sell out this winter. Then, make your shopping list and visit your local club!\n\nSwiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix\n\nPrice: $9.99 for 50 packets\n\nMelanie Musson, a retail finance expert with Clearsurance, recommended the Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix. \u201cCostco won\u2019t carry hot chocolate all year. So, if you\u2019re hosting a sledding party or love to drink hot chocolate often, buy the bulk pack at Costco before they sell out,\u201d said Musson.\n\nThe hot cocoa mix is gluten-free, contains no artificial sweeteners, and is 99.9% caffeine-free. That means you can feel good about having a cup (or two!).\n\nFlamePro Table-Top Patio Heater\n\nPrice: $69.99\n\nThe FlamePro Table-Top Patio Heater puts out heat more than four feet from the unit in any direction, making it ideal for cozying up while sitting on your patio or porch. You can get up to 83 hours of burn time if you hook it up to an external 20-gallon propane tank (not included).\n\nThe heater is an attractive addition to your space because you can see the flame from all angles. It\u2019s also safe to use. The propane will automatically shut off if the flame gets extinguished or the unit tips over.\n\n\u201cA porch heater can make hanging out outdoors fun even in the winter. If you have a Blackstone or a grill, turning on the porch heater can extend your outdoor cooking season,\u201d said Musson.\n\nSolo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Essential Bundle with Pellet Adapter\n\nPrice: $249.99\n\nThe Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Essential Bundle with Pellet Adapter can also help you enjoy your space during the cold winter months. Burning wood or pellets, the unit runs 400 degrees hotter than a conventional fire, so it doesn\u2019t produce smoke or heavy ash.\n\nIt\u2019s also very portable. Weighing just 25 pounds and measuring less than two feet across any dimension, you can easily bring a bonfire to the beach, on a camping trip, or to another part of your yard.\n\nBen Huber, co-founder of DollarSprout, pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a winter purchase\u2013we use it year-round, whether it\u2019s making s\u2019mores with the kids or just relaxing outside on cooler nights. By the time March rolls around, most of these fire pits will be gone, and if you wait until next fall, prices will be back to full retail.\u201d\n\nSaluSpa Arctic Ice Cold Plunge Bath\n\nPrice: $149.99\n\nThe SaluSpa Artic Ice Cold Plunge Bath offers a refreshing and invigorating experience for those willing to immerse themselves in 111 gallons of frigid water. The sturdy walls are designed to hold up in extremely low temperatures.\n\nWith a 27-pound dry weight, the tub is easy to move and can get set up in minutes. When you\u2019re done, you can lock the cover in place with included clips.\n\n\u201cWith more people getting into biohacking and cold therapy, these have gone from niche items to something that actually sells out. If you\u2019ve ever thought about adding one to your home, Costco\u2019s pricing is some of the best you\u2019ll find. But they\u2019re not a regular inventory item \u2014 once the winter stock is gone, it may not return for months,\u201d said Huber.\n\nGreenmade 27-Gallon Storage Bins\n\nPrice: $49.99 (for 4 bins)\n\nGreenmade 27-Gallon Storage Bins can help with your upcoming spring cleaning or any other organizational projects you have planned. These heavy-duty storage solutions are stackable and feature ergonomic handles, making them easier to lift and move.\n\nThe bins also have padlock holes to secure your contents if needed. You can choose the black and yellow or red and green color scheme.\n\n\u201cHeavy-duty storage bins are harder to find in the spring. Right now is peak time for storage bins at Costco, but what most people don\u2019t realize is that they can be surprisingly hard to find later in the year. Between people tackling spring cleaning and college students needing bins for moving and summer storage, these can actually become annoyingly difficult to find at a good price,\u201d Huber said.\n\nPok\u00e9mon TCG: Charizard ex Super-Premium Collection\n\nPrice: $54.99\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon TCG: Charizard ex Super-Premium Collection contains:\n\n10 TCG booster packs (cards vary by pack)\n\n3 foil cards\n\n1 code card for Pok\u00e9mon TCG Live\n\n1 card display figure featuring Charizard\n\n\u201cPok\u00e9mon cards are nearly impossible to find at retail. On March 28, a brand-new set, Journey Together, is set to launch, which will only push demand higher. If you\u2019re lucky enough to find that set at Costco when it drops, it\u2019s a home run.\n\n\u201cBut even before and after the release, demand for any Pok\u00e9mon set is expected to stay high, meaning whatever Costco has in stock will likely be gone fast. If you see Pok\u00e9mon cards, don\u2019t hesitate \u2014 you may not get another shot at them at retail prices,\u201d said Huber.",

These are all things that aren\u2019t technically cults, but sometimes they sure seem that way to those outside the group. Shopping at Costco? There are a number of people who may put Costco fanatics in that category, too.\n\nBut can you blame them? Between free samples, an insanely affordable food court in the store, quality bulk products at great prices, an unmatched return policy and employees that aren\u2019t just nice because they\u2019re told to be, but because they\u2019re truly happy, it\u2019s a fun place to shop. Whether it\u2019s weekly or monthly, there are plenty of Idaho families that look forward to their Costco trips!\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nIdahoans Don\u2019t Always Love Costco\u2019s Changes\n\nConsumer Spending Rises Eight Tenths Of A Percent In July Justin Sullivan, Getty Images loading...\n\nWhen you build the sort of loyalty that Costco\u2019s built, sometimes the smallest change can make shoppers feel like they\u2019ve been betrayed. Over the past year, the popular warehouse store made some tweaks that weren\u2019t exactly well received by Idaho shoppers.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nAcross the country, Costco warehouses saw an uptick in membership sharing that violated their policies. Once upon a time, all you had to do to access the store was flash a membership card at the door, even if it wasn\u2019t yours. Most of the time those people would get busted at check out when the name on their credit card or debit card didn\u2019t match the name on the membership card.\n\nJustin Sullivan, Getty Images Justin Sullivan, Getty Images loading...\n\nAs a result, Costco started installing scanners at the doors of their warehouses to try to catch people trying to pull one over on the company before they got inside. According to the updated policy, membership cards must have a full face photo to be valid. If you have an old card without an ID, you must show a passport or other government issued ID to enter. The policy was met with negativity on social media.\n\nOther changes like the elimination of certain food items at the food court and bakery and a change from Pepsi to Coca-Cola products received some push back, too.\n\nBut Idahoans Will LOVE Costco\u2019s Latest Change\n\nBig-Box Retailer Costco To Announce First Quarter Earnings Scott Olson, Getty Images loading...\n\nCostco\u2019s just announced another change and it\u2019s one that Idaho Costco members should be excited about! Costco\u2019s notorious for having some of the cheapest gas prices in the state. As we\u2019re sitting down to write this, GasBuddy shows that the Boise Costco has gas for $2.99 per gallon. Walmart on Overland is showing the same price, but after that? The next cheapest gas stations are displaying prices of $3.05.\n\nWhile it\u2019s tough to beat gas prices at Costco, there are some hurdles to taking advantage of them. First of all you have to be a member or have been gifted a Costco Shop Card by a member. Second of all, unlike most gas stations around the Gem State, Costco gas stations aren\u2019t 24 hours.\n\nSalt Lake City\u2019s ABC affiliate explains that when Costco\u2019s gas stations close and they\u2019re safety attendants go home for the evening, the pumps use an automatic shut-off and lock so that they can\u2019t be accessed after hours. Not exactly convenient if you\u2019re making a long road trip that extends late into the evening.\n\nWell, that\u2019s changed! As of mid-February, Costco is extending their gas station hours at most of their warehouses in the country, including the locations across Idaho.\n\nThe new gas station hours are:\n\nMonday-Friday: 6 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 6 a.m. - 8:30 p.m.\n\nSunday: 6 a.m. - 7:30 p.m.",

Unfortunately, they usually don't come cheap, but Costco is bringing relaxation to the masses with their SaluSpa Ventura hot tub that's currently just $399.99.

We recently tested a different SaluSpa inflatable hot tub and can attest to just how high-quality they are.\n\nWhile some people love inflatable hot tubs because they're portable, the large size of this Costco version would make transporting it pretty difficult. If you want something truly portable, we'd recommend checking out one of SaluSpa's two- or three-person hot tubs, like the Miami or Tahiti versions.\n\nThe Ventura hot tub, like most SaluSpa units, comes with an energy-saving cover and Freeze Shield, which will automatically begin heating water during cold weather to prevent damage to the hot tub. The Ventura is part of the EnergySense line, which is a major plus for residents of certain states that require inflatable hot tubs to be APSP-14 and Title 20 compliant.\n\nIf Costco's inflatable six- to eight-person hot tub is a bit too big for your space, then not to worry: Amazon has tons of SaluSpa hot tubs that fit anywhere from two- to six-people, with a much smaller patio foot print.\n\n\n\n\n\nSt.Lucia EnergySense AirJet Inflatable Hot Tub\n\n$437.00 at amazon.com\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami AirJet 2 to 4 Person Inflatable Hot Tub\n\n$499.99 at amazon.com\n\n\n\n\n\nTahiti EnergySense AirJet Inflatable Hot Tub Spa\n\n$505.42 at amazon.com\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego UltraFit EnergySense Inflatable Hot Tub\n\n$570.00 at amazon.com\n\nYou Might Also Like",

Almond croissants, one of the newest varieties, have been a quick hit with shoppers, with @costcoguide describing them as \"incredible\" and \"perfection.\" They are made with \"buttery flakey croissant dough\" and \"filled with the perfect amount of almond filling\" and topped with powdered sugar. \"Wow, these new almond croissants at Costco are incredible! \ud83e\udd24 The almond flavor, texture, flakiness of the croissant are perfection! Well done Costco Bakery,\" the Instagram video is captioned. Can't eat them all at once? \"I individually wrap them and pop them in a freezer bag if I don't want a dozen on my counter all the time. They defrost quickly and are so good!\" writes one fan.\n\nKirland Signature Milk Chocolate Almonds\n\nKirkland Signature Milk Chocolate Almonds are another favorite of shoppers. \"Those chocolate almonds get me every time, they're so good I can't help but shove my hand in the container and eat 100 every time I pass by lol,\" one says. \"They've been an obsession of mine for at least 10 years,\" another writes. \"7650 calories in the whole barrel\" and \"2550 calories per day if you eat 1/3rd of it per day,\" another points out. \"Yeah the only way to win is to not play at all.

Nothing better. I used to buy them by the pound at Sprouts when they were on sale. I refuse to walk down the chocolate-covered raisin aisle at Costco because I know what will happen,\" one maintains.\n\nCostco Muffins\n\nAnd of course, Costco's larger-than-life muffins are one of the bakery's most talked-about items. \"The blueberry muffins are SO good (and very large) for the price!\" writes one Redditor. \"I LOVE the almond poppyseed ones so much,\" adds another. Other favorites include chocolate chunk and apple crumb. Insider tip: If you can't eat all of them within a few days, simply freeze them.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e",

            "content": "After a nearly two-and-a-half-year bull run on Wall Street, there are a lot of stocks trading at elevated valuations. Much of the market's run was powered by artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that investors are so bullish about that there's seemingly no valuation high enough to give them pause. Few stocks have benefited from investors' thirst for AI exposure more than Palantir Technologies (PLTR -4.82%), which is now up by more than 790% over the last five years.\n\nBut other stocks in sectors that have nothing to do with AI have joined the party as well, one being Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%). The beloved warehouse retailer hasn't changed the price of its hot dogs since the mid-1980s, and consumers seemingly can't get enough of its products. Likewise, Wall Street can't get enough of the stock, which is now up over 187% in the last five years, a huge move for a large-cap consumer staples company.\n\nWith those impressive climbs in mind, which one of these stocks is more overvalued today?\n\nPalantir: Trades at 152 times forward earnings\n\nPalantir provides its clients with the ability to gather large volumes of data from different sources and use complex AI models to analyze that data like never before. This includes drawing up potential scenarios and outcomes and offering real-time insights about how to solve problems. The technology can be useful for a wide array of purposes, from the U.S. Department of Defense working on counterterrorism efforts to a business attempting to solve a tricky logistical issue.\n\nInvestors have flocked to the stock, which as of Feb. 27 traded at $84.68 a share, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 152 -- and that was after a nearly 20% sell-off in the week prior. Over the last three months, 18 Wall Street analysts have issued research reports on Palantir. Four have rated the stock a buy, nine call it a hold, and five rate it a sell, according to TipRanks. Their average 12-month price target is about 10% higher than its recent level.\n\nMany investors assumed the stock was vulnerable to a correction heading into its fourth-quarter earnings report in early February. However, after Palantir beat analysts' estimates on both earnings and revenue and provided better guidance than Wall Street expected, the stock soared. Last week, RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria put an underperform rating and a $40 price target on the stock. Jaluria expressed concern about the resignation of the company's chief accounting officer, expected defense spending cuts by the U.S. government, and a new agreement with CEO Alex Karp that allows him to sell nearly 10 million of his Palantir shares through early September of this year.\n\nOn the other hand, Loop Capital analyst Mark Schappel recently initiated coverage of Palantir with a buy rating and $141 price target, saying the AI company has all the makings of a game-changing software stock, including a massive addressable market, a strong management team, and the potential to be an industry leader.\n\nCostco: Trades at 56 times forward earnings\n\nWhile it doesn't sport a valuation at quite the same nosebleed level as Palantir, I don't think many people would have expected this kind of re-rating for a company that has historically been viewed as a defensive stock. Investors have long believed in Costco's business model, which involves selling products in bulk to consumers at bargain prices. It also charges people annual membership fees for access to its warehouse stores -- fees that provide the bulk of its profits and create a solid stream of recurring revenue. In recent years, Costo has ramped up its e-commerce business. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended in late November, the company's e-commerce sales grew 13% year over year.\n\nOver the last three months, 24 Wall Street analysts issued research reports on the retailer, with 16 rating its stock a buy and eight rating it a hold, according to TipRanks. The average 12-month price target among those analysts is about 6.4% higher than its level as of Feb. 27.\n\nCostco has continued to roll along to start the year, reporting January U.S. sales that were significantly ahead of the consensus expectation. The chain is also planning to open 29 new stores in its fiscal 2025.\n\nAlthough the market has been concerned lately about the weakening financial condition of the U.S. consumer, Costco tends to be more resilient during economic downturns because of its membership model and the fact that it serves many higher-income customers. Still, throughout Costco's long history as a publicly traded company, its trailing-12-month P/E ratio has never been as high as it has been lately.\n\nWhich stock is more overvalued?\n\nIn fairness, both stocks look overvalued to me, despite each company's strong and improving results. However, these companies operate in very different sectors. Palantir is a tech sector player with a focus on AI -- an industry where a host of fundamental factors remain cloudy, from just how big the market for AI actually is to how disruptive it could be to how easy its models would be to replicate.\n\nCostco, on the other hand, has a consistent and reliable business model in a fairly well understood retail industry. There is also a growth story baked in when you consider its growing e-commerce sales and its expansion in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nUltimately, between the two, I think Palantir is the riskier bet right now because of the unknowns regarding AI, but it also has more upside potential. Costco's re-rating seems real, but it's hard to know if it will be able to maintain this high of a valuation. Both stocks are susceptible to pullbacks.",

Another TikToker, who goes by the handle @thisismyonlypage, declared that as a mom, she was tired of people telling her that children shouldn\u2019t be allowed to go anywhere, whether it\u2019s a grocery store or a plane.\n\nShe recommended that those who can\u2019t stand to be around kids use a delivery service instead of going out shopping.\n\nSoon enough, Brightyn made an apology video to address the situation. She explained that she had a bad experience at Costco and didn\u2019t mean to offend any families.\n\n\u201cI did not realize that Costco was such a sacred time to a lot of families, and I\u2019m glad that families all have their different ways of spending time,\u201d Brightyn said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that 99 percent of people\u2019s kids and families are great at Costco; there\u2019s just always that one percent where they let their kids run amok,\u201d she added.\n\npimampix \u2013 stock.adobe.com \u2013 illustrative purposes only, not the actual child\n\nSign up for Chip Chick\u2019s newsletter and get stories like this delivered to your inbox.\n\nMany TikTok users felt that her apology was insincere and were loath to accept it. Hopefully, she has learned her lesson about attacking parents for bringing their kids to Costco after several moms gave her a reality check.\n\n\u201cSometimes, places like Costco are the only time a mom is able to get out of the house and feel human. Until you have kids of your own, there are some things you\u2019ll never understand. Just try to be kinder,\u201d pointed out one user.\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to leave my child alone at home to go shopping? My husband and I both pick things out at the store. It\u2019s so weird to hear non-parents commenting on stuff they have no idea about, lol,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mom of four, I\u2019m married and can\u2019t drive due to having epilepsy. So when my husband wants to make a Costco trip, I\u2019m going with my kids,\u201d commented a third.\n\nEmily Chan By Emily Chan is a writer who covers lifestyle and news content.

But not every meal at Costco\u2019s freezer or prepared foods section is worth the cost. Some options are overpriced, have poor reviews or can be found for cheaper elsewhere. Here are six meals at Costco that probably aren\u2019t worth your money and where you can find better alternatives.\n\nAlso here are seven types of appliances you should also skip at Costco.\n\nFor You: What $100 in Groceries at Costco Will Cost You at Walmart\n\nTrending Now: 5 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nTrending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move?\n\nFrozen Chicken Bake\n\nPrice: $13.50 per box\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Chicken Bake is a fan-favorite at the Costco food court, but the frozen version they sell isn\u2019t as good, according to some customer reviews. Many unhappy customers say that the frozen version doesn\u2019t have the same fresh and crispy texture as the in-store version.\n\nSo, if you want a warm and cheesy chicken bake, buy the ones sold at Costco\u2019s food court or simply make your own using Costco\u2019s rotisserie chicken, some pre-made dough and a mix of cheese and Caesar dressing.\n\nSee More: 8 Top Costco Buys Still Loved by the Rich and Wealthy\n\nRana Maine Lobster Ravioli\n\nPrice: approximately $15 for a two-pack\n\nLobster ravioli sounds pretty luxurious, but many Costco shoppers have been disappointed by Costco\u2019s version. Some reviews say that their lobster has a bland flavor and that the filling tastes more like a cheese blend than real seafood.\n\nIf you\u2019re craving lobster ravioli without spending a fortune, head to Trader Joe\u2019s instead. Each package of lobster ravioli only costs around $5 at Trader Joe\u2019s. And even though it comes with fewer servings, the taste is rated better and you\u2019re not committing to a large and expensive Costco pack that might not meet your expectations.\n\nKirkland Signature Chicken Alfredo\n\nPrice: approximately $16 for a tray\n\nCostco\u2019s Chicken Alfredo comes with pre-cooked pasta, chicken breast strips, shredded cheese and a big packet of alfredo sauce. It might seem like a convenient dinner option, but you may want to think twice before buying since many customers complain that it\u2019s too greasy and bland. The large portion size also means you\u2019re committing to a meal that may not reheat well.\n\nYou can easily make your own version at home using Costco\u2019s rotisserie chicken, pasta and a jar of Alfredo sauce.\n\nKirkland Signature Shepherd\u2019s Pie\n\nPrice: approximately $20 per tray\n\nCostco\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Pie comes with a pretty big portion, but many reviewers complain that the mashed potatoes taste artificial and that the meat layer is too soupy. For a meal that costs almost $20, you might expect better quality.\n\nInstead of paying for an underwhelming pre-made meal, make your own using ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables and real mashed potatoes. Aldi offers a solid frozen shepherd\u2019s pie for less than $10 if you don\u2019t have time to make one from scratch.\n\nKirkland Signature Street Taco Kit\n\nPrice: approximately $15 per kit\n\nCostco\u2019s taco kit is a popular grab-and-go meal, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the money. Many customers say that the tortillas become soggy quickly and the chicken is either too salty or dry. Even though it\u2019s only $15 for a meal that serves about four, you probably won\u2019t be impressed with the taste.\n\nInstead, create your own taco kit using Costco\u2019s pre-cooked grilled chicken strips, a bag of tortillas and some fresh toppings.\n\nKirkland Signature Mac and Cheese\n\nPrice: approximately $12 per tray\n\nCostco\u2019s pre-made mac and cheese is rich and creamy, but it\u2019s also pretty expensive for what it is. Like many of Costco\u2019s meals, this mac and cheese comes in a large portion. However, some customers say that it lacks seasoning and isn\u2019t much better than cheaper boxed versions.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some alternatives, Trader Joe\u2019s sells a few options that may offer a better taste and texture for a fraction of the cost. You can also make your own using a pack of shredded cheddar cheese and elbow pasta, which are both available at Costco for a much lower per-serving price.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Pricing and availability may vary depending on location.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 6 Meals at Costco That Aren\u2019t Worth the Money",

Pay $449.99 for a $500 gift certificate with Alaska Airlines ; this constitutes a 10% discount.\n\n; this constitutes a 10% discount.

That means you\u2019ll need to head to your local Costco warehouse.\n\nIs It Worth It?\n\nWhen we see discounted gift cards for airlines, we tend to lunge. It\u2019s a pretty rare find, especially with a discount as decent as 10%.\n\nAlaska Airlines B737-9 MAX plane at LAX. Image Credit: Ryan Smith\n\nThat said, this is something that aligns with those who are already on the move. If you\u2019re not a frequent flyer with Alaska Airlines, or if you don\u2019t already have upcoming trips to take with the airline, this purchase isn\u2019t so great that you should buy just for the sake of buying.\n\nHowever, for those with upcoming travel plans, it\u2019s possible to multiply your rewards on the purchase.\n\nIf You\u2019re Chasing Rewards\n\nYou\u2019ll always want to use the best card to maximize your airline purchases, which means you should be paying with a card such as the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. More than this, however, is the opportunity to stack earnings for a pretty sweet return with the Capital One Venture card:\n\nEarn 2x Capital One miles on all purchases to maximize your gain. We value Capital One miles at 1.8 cents each , which brings these savings to 3.6%\n\n, which brings these savings to 3.6% This is a double-dip purchase: The savings of 10% off the list price, in addition to 3.6% in earned points, brings us to a total of 13.6% in savings.\n\npurchase: The savings of 10% off the list price, in addition to 3.6% in earned points, brings us to a total of 13.6% in savings. If applicable, you can actually triple dip if you\u2019re an Executive member with Costco. Executive members receive an additional 2% cash-back, creating a grand total of 15.6% off your purchase.\n\nCompare this to using The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express to purchase the flight directly from Alask Airlines without the gift card. Amex Platinum cardholders earn 5x Membership Rewards per $1 spent on flights booked directly with the airline or via AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 per year, then 1x). We value Amex points at 2.2 cents each, which would bring your return to 11%\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a deal that can out-value the Amex Platinum card, but in this instance, stacking rewards will allow you to get more from your money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWe\u2019ve scoured the web for deals that will take your dollar further, and for the right person, this could be a serious saver. Combine discounted gift cards, double miles, and store-sponsored cash-back to boost the discount to 15.6%.",

            "content": "Shopping at Costco isn't like going to a discount grocery store\u2014yes, you are saving a lot of money by buying in bulk, but it's not cheap, especially if you're buying for a large household. However, people who know what to look for can pick up items that are ridiculously good value for money. Even with the many bargains the warehouse chain offers savvy shoppers, there are some deals that seem almost too good to be true\u2014but really are that good, members say. Here are 7 Costco items shoppers say offer the best bang for your buck.\n\nNormandy-Style Vegetable Blend\n\nCostco shoppers love the 5.5 lb Kirkland Signature Normandy-Style Vegetable Blend. \"The giant bag of Normandy-style vegetables. It's a great side for almost every meal,\" one fan commented. \"Pair that with their pesto and some pasta \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc,\" another agreed. \"I've been making soup with normandy vegetables and the bulgogi dumplings. Easiest way I've found yet to get all my veggies in one bowl,\" another added.\n\nQuaker Oats Old Fashioned Oatmeal\n\nThe Quaker Oats Old Fashioned Oatmeal is a ridiculously good deal at $11.99 for $10. \"I always keep this brand product on hand in my home,\" one shopper said. \"We had oatmeal for breakfast quite often as children, so I keep it for that reason, but also because it is quite a versatile product for general cooking. For example, it can be used in muffins, meat loaf, breads and in making granola. My cooking routine would be doomed without it so I always replace it quickly before I run out. It's nice to have the double package. It keeps me from running to the grocers. I keep it in the freezer until ready for use.\"6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\n25 Healthiest Costco Foods, According to Dietitians\n\nPrescription and OTC Medications\n\nDon't sleep on Costco's prescription and OTC medications\u2014shoppers are constantly amazed at how much cheaper it is to get them from the warehouse chain. This includes pet medications, glasses, and contact lenses as well. The deals are astounding. \"I bought the Kirkland brand allergy pills (they're pink and are basically Benadryl),\" one Redditor shared. \"Each bottle comes with 600 pills for $8 (I think it was $6 in the beginning of the pandemic). I have to take an antihistamine everyday so these pills are literally the best because of all the frigging money I've saved. Bought the bottle 2 years ago and they expire later this year and with the help of my dad we still have 1/4 of the bottle left.\"\n\nJIF Peanut Butter\n\nJif Creamy Peanut Butter is an absolute steal at Costco, shoppers say. \"Peanut butter is dramatically cheaper if you buy JIF from Costco,\" one Redditor shared. \"Kirkland Signature actually costs more than JIF since it's organic, while JIF is just cheaper from Costco than elsewhere since it's a huge jar. Again, it lasts a long time, is cheap, and has lots of calories and protein. For PB&Js, Strawberry Jam from Kirkland Signature is super high quality and the best bang for your buck, but the cherry jam is only slightly more expensive if you get bored of it.\"\n\nKirkland Signature Creamy Almond Butter\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Creamy Almond Butter ($9.69) is another great bargain, members say.\n\n\"My wife loves it and it's half the price compared to anything I can get in any other store in town. That being said, she usually just has it with apple slices with her breakfast 3-4 times a week,\" one shopper shared. \"BEST ALMOND BUTTER EVER\u2026 at half the price of anything comparable elsewhere,\" another agreed.\n\nOrvis Men's Flannel Shirt\n\nCostco shoppers don't ignore the great bargains available in the clothing section, like this Orvis Men's Flannel Shirt ($14.97). \"The very best 'buy' at Costco is Orvis clothing (mostly men's). I have bought a number of items in the $15 \u2013 $20 range that are on the Orvis web site for $80 \u2013 $100. And it's really quality stuff. Wears well and comes out of the washer ready to go. Now it's not necessarily 'fashionable' but for old guys like me it's terrific,\" one shopper said.\n\n7 Costco Items That Have Gotten 'Way More Expensive,' Say Shoppers\n\nKirkland Signature Organic Quinoa\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Organic Quinoa (4.5 lbs) is a ridiculously good deal, shoppers say. \"The quinoa is insanely cheap for how much you get $8.99 for 5 lb sack,\" one Redditor said. \"This is the only quinoa that I will buy. I make this quinoa in the pressure cooker, and it cooks to perfection each time. I purchased other brands of quinoa that needed a lot more attention/ingredients/time to make and did not taste as good as the Kirkland Signature Organic Quinoa. Buy this brand. You will not regret your purchase!\" another shopper shared.",

            "content": "Confession: I had never stepped foot inside a Costco store until I was 36. I\u2019d mention this to friends, especially folks who worked in the culinary world, and they would gasp. Then they\u2019d exclaim: \u201cBut you write about food for a living! You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.\u201d Turns out, that was very accurate. Last summer, a few trusted chef pals took me on my maiden voyage, giving me a tour of their favorite aisles and pointing out preferred products. Soon after, I signed up for a membership\u2014and haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve been making up for lost time by viewing each trip more as an adventure rather than an errand. I love to swing into Costco on a weeknight, when it\u2019s usually not as bustling as it is on a weekend, and wander through the aisles to try to find the hidden gems. In addition to discoveries like a huge deal on an electric toothbrush (a tool that has been linked to better dental and heart health) and fresh produce, I\u2019ve unearthed all sorts of hidden gems under the store\u2019s in-house label: Kirkland Signature. Below I\u2019m revealing six Kirkland Signature products I rely on and would recommend to anyone.\n\n1. Kirkland Signature Cooked Shrimp & Cocktail Sauce\n\nCostco is obviously a stellar stop before you attend or host a party. But it\u2019s not just great for a crowd. I often snag this shrimp cocktail platter for a midafternoon snack. In between writing stories, I simply head to the fridge, add several shrimp to a small plate, give them a spritz from a fresh lemon wedge and drizzle on some cocktail sauce. All of a sudden, what could have been a sad desk snack (I\u2019m looking at you, crumbly granola bar) becomes an opportunity to add to my protein tally and savor something that feels like what I might order at a steakhouse or stylish cocktail lounge. Beyond being easy and delicious, shrimp nutrition speaks for itself. Each 3-ounce serving packs in 20 grams of protein (more than 2 eggs!), plus the shellfish delivers a dose of heart-healthy omega-3 fats and thyroid-supporting minerals like iodine and selenium.\n\n2. Kirkland Signature Organic Tomato Paste\n\nAll throughout the year, including on the coldest days of winter, I can enjoy the vibrant, sweet-tart taste of tomatoes in a wide variety of recipes using this ultra-affordable tomato paste. Available in a 12-pack, each 6-ounce can works out to less than $1 at my Costco store. Although I generally prefer squeeze-bottle tomato paste, I\u2019m willing to make a small sacrifice for the value. If I don\u2019t use it all in dishes like Shakshuka, Marry Me Melting Cabbage, or Umami Paste, I simply freeze any extra in an ice cube tray so I can pop out as much as I need to add to dishes.\n\n3. Kirkland Signature Organic Pure Maple Syrup\n\nAll sweeteners, even natural ones like honey and maple syrup, increase the calories and added sugars in our diets. They also amp up the flavor and satisfaction factor, though, and that\u2019s an important part of the recipe for a happy life, if you ask me. I adore the warm, autumnal flavor maple syrup provides\u2014alongside its sweetness, of course. I also swoon over the price of this bulk buy; about 44 cents per ounce at my area store. As for how I use it, when I was a kid, I was all about showering my stack of pancakes or waffles in several servings of maple syrup. These days, I\u2019m much more likely to put this golden syrup to use in more unconventional ways, including Persian-Style Butternut Squash Soup, Maple-Roasted Sweet Potatoes, and Maple Whiskey Sours.\n\n4. Kirkland Signature Almond Milk\n\nOne of the best deals that initially convinced me to join Team Costco even as a single person was the Ninja Creami Deluxe ice cream maker. That initial investment of $180 has already paid off in the savings I\u2019ve accrued by not buying ice cream by the pint anymore. Instead, I combine a cup of Kirkland Signature Almond Non-Dairy Beverage, Original Unsweetened, which can stand up to any of its brand-name competitors, with a protein shake and a spoonful of pudding mix. Freeze for 12 to 24 hours, blitz on the \u201clight ice cream\u201d setting, and all of a sudden I have a high-protein dessert that tastes like something I\u2019d order at my favorite parlor. Besides in Creami concoctions, the almond milk comes in clutch for baking recipes and smoothies, too.\n\n5. Kirkland Signature Stir-Fry Vegetable Blend\n\nSeveral interviews with gastroenterologist Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., have taught me many things. Why so many of us struggle to poop while traveling. The fact that 95% of Americans are deficient in fiber. The many benefits of eating a diversified diet. In fact, Dr. B. recommends aiming to eat at least 30 different plant-based foods per week for optimal gut health. This number can feel daunting, especially to someone who lives alone and tries to limit her food waste. But little hacks like this freezer aisle find make it almost effortless. The fiber- and vitamin C-rich blend features eight veggies in one budget-friendly 5\u00bd-pound bag: broccoli, sugar snap peas, green beans, yellow and orange carrots, mushrooms, red bell peppers, water chestnuts and onions. I add this veggie mix to soups, stir-fries and pasta dishes or simply saut\u00e9 the veggies with garlic and coconut aminos to serve on the side of any entree.\n\n6. Kirkland Signature 2023 Ti Point Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand\n\nWhen my cellar could use a refresh, I steer over to the wine section at Costco and grab a bottle or two of this Kirkland Signature savvy B. It\u2019s ideal for cracking open to enjoy a glass alongside dinner and perfect for using in any recipe that calls for \u201cdry white wine.\u201d The zippy vino smells like tropical fruit and tastes like a lovely fruit salad starring citrus fruit, stone fruit and green apples. Served with a chill, this wine is as refreshing as its price: $7.99 per bottle near me.",

            "content": "In the past decade, shares of Costco (COST -3.93%) have generated a monster total return of 731%. This means that an investor who put $10,000 into the stock in late February 2015 would be sitting on a balance of over $83,000 today. The huge gain far exceeds the performance of the overall S&P 500.\n\nThis top retail stock trades near record territory. And the company's market cap is steadily approaching the $500 billion mark. It's no wonder given Costco's impressive performance.\n\nShould investors buy, sell, or hold shares?\n\nCostco's bullish case\n\nIt's not difficult to find reasons to appreciate this company. I think there are three top factors that support the bullish case for Costco.\n\nFor starters, the company benefits from a major cost advantage. Costco raked in $250 billion in net sales in its fiscal 2024 (which ended Sept. 1). This means it has tremendous negotiating leverage over its suppliers when it's buying merchandise for its hundreds of warehouses.\n\nAnd this results in everyday low prices for consumers. Costco maintains a low gross margin of 12% to 13%. The purpose is to drive greater sales volume, which reinforces its existing cost advantage.\n\nAnother bull case comes from customer loyalty. Of course, selling high-quality goods at low prices might be enough to keep customers happy and coming back for more; this is what all retailers want. And Costco does well in this regard, as exemplified by its ability to grow same-store sales at a solid clip year in and year out. Costco experiences durable demand, which reduces risk for investors worried about correctly forecasting the direction of the economic cycle.\n\nBut what separates Costco from an operational perspective is its membership model, which requires customers to pay annual fees for the right to shop at warehouse locations. These fees have strong renewal rates, they produce pricing power, and they provide a recurring, high-margin revenue stream.\n\nAll these factors help Costco consistently increase its net income, which is another reason to be bullish on the business. In the past decade, net income rose by 258%. This was faster than the 126% gain in revenue, indicating Costco's scalability.\n\nGenerating positive earnings and free cash flow on a regular basis is fantastic to see -- and Costco's management team isn't shy about returning excess capital to shareholders. Yes, the company pays a regular dividend that yields just 0.45%. But every once in a while, investors are rewarded with a sizable one-time dividend, the last one being $15 per share paid in January 2024.\n\nThe only reason to steer clear\n\nAnyone who spends time understanding Costco's business and its financial success will certainly come away impressed. This is truly a great company, and I don't believe anyone will argue with that statement.\n\nMoreover, this perspective might make you question why you don't own this stock in your own portfolio. After all, the company's track record speaks for itself when it comes to compounding shareholder capital.\n\nBut it's also important for investors to gauge the market's sentiment. Considering the valuation is a key part of the puzzle that shouldn't be ignored, and this is where Costco leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 61. Throughout its entire history as a public company, which goes all the way back to 1985, Costco shares have only once been more expensive (earlier in February). It's safe to say that the investment community is head over heels with this company.\n\nThe steep valuation leaves prospective shareholders with zero margin of safety. Despite what history suggests, I have low confidence that Costco can outperform the S&P 500 over the next five or 10 years. I think it's best to wait for a lower valuation before buying.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nIt's important to know the benefits and downsides of buying gold from Costco before making that move. Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAmericans are increasingly turning to gold for stability as economic uncertainty continues. Last year, interest in gold catapulted to new heights, primarily due to a weak economy and heavy central bank purchases around the globe. Consequently, the spot price of gold surpassed even the most optimistic experts' opinions, hitting new peaks in 2024 and continuing into 2025.\n\nAmid disappointing economic reports, stocks plummeted last week, and both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.7%, marking their worst one-day decline of the year. Meanwhile, the price of gold is up over $250 per ounce since the start of the year (as of February 27, 2025).\n\nWhile the economy certainly figures heavily, gold's upward trend also reflects rising interest in this precious metal. If you're exploring purchasing gold online or in person, it may be an opportune time before prices rise again. You can even purchase gold at Costco and other big retailers \u2014 but should you?\n\nFind out how to add gold to your portfolio today.\n\nCostco gold: Everything to know about buying the metal at the retail chain\n\nHere's what you need to know to help guide your decision.\n\nWhat type of gold does Costco sell (and in what amounts)?\n\nCostco offers members an opportunity to purchase one-ounce gold bars in the store, online or via their app. The retailer offers gold bullion bars, 1-ounce bars and coins in different designs. As of February 2025, Costco offers the following gold products:\n\n1 oz. gold bar PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan\n\n1 oz. gold bar Rand Refinery (online only)\n\n2025 1 oz. American Buffalo gold coin\n\n1 oz. gold bar PAMP / Newmont Lady of Liberty (online only)\n\n100-gram gold bar Rand Refinery\n\nCostco's selection comes from authorized dealers and reputable mints. However, as Costco members are accustomed to, offerings and availability may change.\n\nExplore your gold investing options online now.\n\nHow much is Costco gold?\n\nCostco marks up its cost for gold by roughly 2%. Markup is common practice among gold dealers and retailers, and 2% is on the low end of industry standards.\n\nFor example, the spot price of gold is about $2,850 per ounce currently (as of February 27, 2025). At the same time, a 1-ounce, 24-karat gold bar at Costco runs slightly higher at just over $2,900. The Costco member price for a one-ounce gold American Buffalo Coin is marginally higher at about $3,030 and is limited to one transaction per membership with a five-unit daily maximum. The company also offers a larger 100-gram, 24-karat gold bar from Rand Refinery for about $9,450 with a maximum purchase limit of two units per day.\n\nWhat are some pros of buying Costco gold?\n\nWhen you think of purchasing gold, Costco may not be the first place that comes to mind. However, the retailer is a convenient option that delivers some distinct benefits, such as:\n\nReputation: Costco enjoys a strong reputation for quality products and services at competitive prices.

It's wise to consider these potential concerns before purchasing gold from Costco.\n\nFew offerings: Costco offers quality physical gold bars and coins\n\n\n\nCostco offers quality physical Sales are final: When you purchase gold at Costco, you can't return the gold or get a refund if you're dissatisfied. By contrast, many online gold dealers offer refunds. For example, APMEX allows you to return your gold within seven days, subject to certain conditions.\n\nWhat other precious metals does Costco sell (and in what amounts)?\n\nIn addition to gold bars and coins, Costco offers a limited selection of precious metals online, including silver and platinum. You can buy the 2024 one-ounce PAMP American Buffalo silver round in sets of 20. Customer satisfaction is high, with 788 reviews giving the coins an average rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars.\n\nIf you're looking to diversify your portfolio with platinum, Costco offers members a one-ounce PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan platinum bar. This is 99.95% pure platinum and certified for authenticity.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you're considering purchasing gold, Costco may provide a convenient option to buy gold bars and coins. Bear in mind, though, that gold prices fluctuate and the metal's recent historic run doesn't guarantee future results will be the same. But with commodities analysts adjusting their gold price projections for 2025 upward, this may be a good time to purchase the yellow metal before its price rises further.",

The whipped topping (think: Cool Whip) is light and airy, almost cloudlike with a hint of sweetness and coffee, courtesy of the dusting of powder on top.\n\nThere is plenty of cold brew coffee flavor folded into the cheesecake filling, which is extra velvety and creamy, thanks to the mascarpone, and ever so slightly tangy. If the warehouse sold this on its own in a container (\u00e0 la Magnolia\u2019s banana pudding), I\u2019d gladly purchase and snack on it by the spoonful throughout the week.\n\nCredit: Mara Weinraub Credit: Mara Weinraub\n\nThen, there\u2019s the all-important base. Unless I\u2019m eating a Basque cheesecake, I want a generous layer of buttery graham cracker crust to balance out the filling. This crust is well over a quarter-inch thick (yes, I measured) and has a bit of mocha-meets-burnt-caramel flavor to it. I\u2019m a fan.\n\nI cut myself a decent-size slice, roughly one-twelth of the cake, and kept going back to it throughout the evening. I finally tapped out with two or three bites remaining, which is very unlike me. But it did get me thinking: It\u2019d make a great stand-in for a Costco birthday cake \u2014 especially for my dad, who loves tiramisu and cheesecake, and was born in March.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFind it in stores: Kirkland Signature Tiramisu Cheesecake, $23.99 for 4.5 pounds at Costco\n\nThis article originally published on The Kitchn.

The deli recently announced a new Pastrami and Corned Beef Combo Pack, offering a well-rounded taste of its nearly 90-year legacy.\n\n\u201cCarnegie Deli is more than just a deli; it\u2019s a New York institution and has been a cultural symbol of the city\u2019s vibrant Jewish deli tradition since 1937,\u201d Carnegie Deli Group CEO Sarri Harper tells Food & Wine. \u201cWe want Costco customers to feel like they're getting a genuine taste of New York, a piece of our legacy, with every bite.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1937, the Theater District deli was co-owned by restaurateurs Leo Steiner and Milton Parker and was situated just down the street from Carnegie Hall \u2014 hence its name. It enjoyed popularity among locals and celebrities alike for decades, until a glowing review in the New York Times in 1979 gave it wider acclaim, per NPR. Often considered a must-stop for visitors, Carnegie Deli was recognized for its nostalgic restaurant interior and sky-high stacked Pastrami sandwiches.\n\nHitting 50 Costco locations across the Northeast next month, the combo pack will be available in stores throughout Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. The deli anticipates wider retail availability in the coming months, so if your local Costco isn\u2019t included, a little patience might pay off.\n\nThe original Carnegie Deli closed in 2016, but the brand\u2019s legendary sandwiches have lived on through a Madison Square Garden outpost and an online retail site. Before the closure, its Midtown location was a favorite of locals, tourists, and celebrities \u2014 its nostalgic gallery wall of famous visitors a testament to its cultural impact.\n\nThis launch marks the first time Carnegie Deli has offered this Pastrami and Corned Beef two-pack at grocery stores, bringing the deli\u2019s most iconic cuts to the bulk retailer\u2019s meat department. The combo includes two 12-ounce packages, which is just enough to recreate the deli\u2019s ridiculously tall sandwiches at home. Even better, each 1.5-pound combo pack also costs just under $18.\n\nAs Harper tells Food & Wine, the deli prepares pastrami and corned beef using a unique blend of spices and a traditional family recipe. Its in-house Pastrami is brined, seasoned, and smoked using that family recipe, while the Corned Beef undergoes a curing process and simmers for peak tenderness. The Costco two-pack, we\u2019re told, is no different.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing a true New York deli experience to Costco customers by offering pastrami and corned beef made with the same quality and passion that goes into all of our sandwiches,\u201d Harper explains.\n\nNow that\u2019s something we\u2019d raise a Rueben to.",

Those plans were then pulled before a city council vote.\n\nCranston was yet again the proposed site of a Costco in August 2023 at the site of the former medium security prison in the Howard Industrial Park. Prior to the Costco proposal the site had been planned for a warehouse. It sold at auction for $6.2 million. Mayor Ken Hopkins touted the plans on the 17-acre site.\n\nWhile much of the state was salivating at the idea of closer $1.50 hot dogs and $5 rotisserie chickens, the retailer pulled its plans in January 2024.\n\n\"No sooner than they gave us everything did they retract it all without prejudice and now it's not moving forward,\" Cranston's planning director at the time, Jason Pezzullo, said. \"For a brief second it was there, and then it was gone.\"\n\nCranston planning officials had the full set of plans for three days before they were pulled, with no reason given.\n\nWith Cranston out of the running, other mayors and elected officials in the state tried wooing the retailer, with former Warwick city council president Stephen McAllister inviting the retailer, in February 2024, to tour the city and sit down with city and state leaders.\n\nOther cities and towns then started to court Costco themselves, including officials in Smithfield. None of that courting came to anything and Rhode Island remains without a Costco.\n\nThanks to our subscribers, who help make this coverage possible.

            "content": "As the Trump Administration sets out to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government and private sector, a number of major companies have joined in the effort. Some others, however, have decidedly not.\n\nWhile companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and some Wall Street banks have reversed course on DEI-related policies and pledges\u2014many of which were made in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020\u2014others, like Pinterest, have expressed caution over how the Trump-led backlash against DEI could impact their business.\n\nStill, others see an abrupt shift away from DEI to be short-sighted.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple shareholders rejected a proposal to abolish its DEI initiatives, after the company\u2019s board of directors made the case that ditching its DEI programs would \u201crestrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.\u201d And earlier Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi told the Financial Times, \u201cWe think that building an employment group that is diverse, that is global, that thinks about all aspects of the business, that\u2019s positive\u2014that\u2019s just good business,\u201d although the company is adjusting its DEI-based executive pay incentives.\n\nHere are some of the major companies that are resisting attacks on their DEI initiatives:\n\nApple\n\nApple became the latest major company to reject a shareholder proposal asking the company to abolish its diversity and inclusion programs, policies, departments, and goals. The bid was drafted by conservative think-tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), which has submitted a number of DEI-related proposals to companies even before President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began.\n\nThe proposal argued that corporate DEI programs expose the company to potential litigation, citing a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that reversed affirmative action in college admissions. But investors at Apple\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 25 rejected the measure, with 97% of votes cast against it.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who met with Trump last week, said at the meeting that Apple has never had quotas or targets. However, he added that the company may have to make adjustments \u201cas the legal landscape around these issues evolves,\u201d according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s has never shied away from social activism\u2014with campaigns around marijuana legalization, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ pride. Unsurprisingly, when it comes to DEI, the ice cream company told CNBC that it has no plans to roll back or slash its efforts.\n\n\u201cWe believe that companies that timidly bow to the current political climate by attempting to turn back the clock will become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and will ultimately be judged as having been on the wrong side of history,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s recently accused its parent company Unilever of trying to mandate its silence on Trump. The company is suing Unilever for allegedly threatening to \u201cdismantle\u201d Ben & Jerry\u2019s independent board and stifling its social activism.\n\nCostco\n\nLast month, the board of directors for Costco Wholesale unanimously opposed a proposal filed by NCPPR, which asked the wholesaler to report the risks of maintaining its DEI policies.\n\n\u201cOur Board has considered this proposal and believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d Costco\u2019s board wrote in its recommendation to shareholders, who would vote on the proposal. \u201cOur efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.\u201d The board added that its DEI policies are legally appropriate.\n\nShareholders voted against the proposal at Costco\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Jan. 23, with 98% votes cast against it.\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nDelta Air Lines maintained its line on DEI efforts last month. \u201cDEI is about talent, and that\u2019s been our focus,\u201d Delta chief external affairs officer Peter Carter reportedly said on an earnings call in January. \u201cWe are steadfast in our commitment because we think they are actually critical to our business.\u201d\n\nFrancesca\u2019s\n\nClothing retailer Francesca\u2019s affirmed its commitment to DEI in a LinkedIn post earlier this month. \u201cDEI is not an abbreviation\u2014it\u2019s a Human Strategy, and respect and inclusion are good for business,\u201d the post said. \u201cAt Francesca\u2019s, we\u2019ve built a culture where employees feel free to be you in all senses,\u201d CEO Andrew Clarke said in an accompanying video. He added that as an openly gay CEO, he has faced prejudice, discrimination, and \u201ceven lost a job\u201d over his identity. DEI is \u201cnot just part of the strategy,\u201d Clarke said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s the human strategy.\u201d\n\nClarke told CNBC that DEI was critical to the company\u2019s rebound after filing for bankruptcy in 2020.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reaffirmed the bank\u2019s support of DEI in a Feb. 24 interview with CNBC. The bank\u2014the largest in the U.S.\u2014will continue its outreach to Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ+, veteran, and disabled communities, Dimon said.\n\nDimon\u2019s comments came after the bank\u2019s latest annual filing earlier this month noted that it \u201chas been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives).\u201d\n\nLush\n\nCosmetics company Lush wanted its message on DEI to be heard\u2014and smelled\u2014putting out three new bath bombs named Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Hilary Jones, global ethics director at Lush, told ADWEEK that the company is \u201cnot going to roll back on anything, and we wanted to make sure that we were visible in not rolling back.\u201d\n\nThe company, known for its colorful soaps with quirky names, has long been vocal about social issues: it launched a soap in the early 2000s called \u201cGay is Okay\u201d and in 2014 supported its employees who staged a protest over police brutality at the Mall of America. After a complaint about the protest was posted on the company\u2019s corporate page, Lush responded: \u201cWe are a campaigning company, and we support the right to free speech and peaceful protest. Standing in solidarity of fairness, justice and equality for all, regardless of gender, race, age, sexuality, and religion\u2014this is something that as a business we do wholeheartedly believe in.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has not made any moves to repeal its DEI policies, according to Bloomberg Law. The company\u2019s chief diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre put forward the business case for supporting diversity and inclusion practices in a Dec. 20 LinkedIn post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about the importance of continuing our diversity and inclusion work, expanding empathy, and anticipating the needs of all our stakeholders, both within Microsoft and beyond,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA workforce strengthened by many perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds is critical to our innovation.\u201d\n\nPatagonia\n\nPatagonia told CNBC that it will not scale back its DEI policies. \u201cWe stand firm in support of our justice, equity and antiracism policies and practices,\u201d the outdoor apparel company said in a statement.\n\nThe company has been well known for its activism around climate issues. \u201cWe know that when we come together and push back, we can win,\u201d Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert recently wrote in TIME, arguing against the Trump Administration leasing or selling 640 million acres of public lands. \u201cAs we have for decades before,\u201d Gellert wrote, \u201cPatagonia will mobilize our community and use our position as a business and supporter of grassroots conservation groups to protect public land and water regardless of who is in the White House.\u201d",

            "content": "At EatingWell, we\u2019re often covering recalls that are most relevant to our readers. And recently, Costco has had quite a few recalls that you should be aware of. From shelf-stable ingredients to appliances, here are five recalls to check your kitchen for.\n\nCanned Tuna\n\nMultiple brands of canned tuna were recalled earlier this month, including Genova. The recalled six-pack of Genova\u2019s 7-ounce Yellowfish Tuna in Olive Oil was sold at Costco warehouses in Florida and Georgia. The tuna has a UPC of 4800063267 and one of the following best-by dates: 1/21/2028, 1/23/2028 or 1/27/2028.\n\nCheck your pantry, and if you have the recalled canned tuna on hand, dispose of it or return it for a refund. The tuna is being recalled due to a manufacturing defect that may compromise the products\u2019 seal. This can allow bacteria like Clostridium botulinum to enter and grow inside the can, which can cause botulism, a foodborne illness.\n\nSymptoms of botulism may include bloating, constipation, muscle weakness, double vision, dizziness, trouble speaking or swallowing and difficulty breathing. Seek medical attention if you are experiencing these signs after eating the recalled tuna.\n\nCold & Flu Medicine\n\nCostco recalled their Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu Plus Congestion tablets sold at Midwest and Southeast warehouse locations. This is due to a possible foreign matter contamination, however it is unclear on what the specifics of this contamination are.\n\nThe impacted packages have a printed lot code of P140082. While the recalled medicine was only sold between October 30 and November 30, 2024, it is a shelf-stable product and may still be in consumers\u2019 cabinets. Be sure to check your cold and flu medicine for the recalled code, and return to your local Costco if it matches. For questions about this recall, call 1-800-426-9391 or email complaints-inquiries@lnkintl.com.\n\nIgloo Coolers\n\nOver 1 million coolers sold at Costco, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Target and other retailers nationwide were recently recalled. The coolers affected are the Igloo 90-quart Flip & Tow Rolling Coolers sold in various colors. The dates of manufacture printed on the bottom of the cooler range from 08/2018 through 12/2023, and the coolers were sold from January 2019 through January 2025.\n\nThis recall follows 12 reports of injuries from the tow handles pinching fingertips against the cooler. This has resulted in fingertip amputations, bone fractures and lacerations. If you have one of the recalled coolers, contact Igloo to request a repair kit. You can request a kit by calling Igloo toll-free at 888-943-5182 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST Monday through Friday or emailing igloo90qt@sedgwick.com.\n\nOvens\n\nLG-branded ovens sold at Costco as well as Best Buy, The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and other appliance stores are recalled due to a fire hazard. The ovens impacted by this recall contain a Slide-In and Freestanding Electric Range and were sold from 2015 through January 2025.\n\nThe recalled ovens contain one of the following model numbers printed inside the oven\u2019s door or storage drawer: LDE4411ST, LDE4413ST, LDE4413BD, LSE4611ST, LSE4611BD, LSE4613ST, LSE4613BD, LSEL6337D, LSEL6337F, LSEL6331F, LSEL6333F, LSEL6333D, LSEL6335D, LSEL6335F, LTE4815BM, LTE4815BD, LTE4815ST, LRE4215ST or LTEL7337F.\n\nThis recall follows about 86 reports of accidental contact of the knobs by humans or pets that caused unintentional activation. This poses a fire hazard and has resulted in property damage, injuries and animal deaths. Check your oven, and if it matches the recall information, contact the company for a free warning sticker and instructions on how to use the control lock on your oven range. Do this by contacting LG at 800-399-3265 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday or emailing lgrange.recall@lge.com.\n\nProtein Bars\n\nIn December, Costco recalled a variety pack of protein bars, but consumers may still have them on hand. The NuGo protein bars being recalled come in an 18-count variety pack and contain two flavors: Dark Chocolate Chocolate Chip and Dark Chocolate Pretzel.\n\nThey were sold from October 2 through November 20, 2024, at Costco locations in the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Vermont. However, they have best-by dates of December 22 or December 23, 2025, so they could still be in customers\u2019 kitchens.\n\nCheck your snack drawer, as these recalled protein bars may contain dairy, even though the bars are marketed to be vegan. Those with dairy intolerance or allergies may experience a reaction after consuming one of these protein bars. In serious cases, this can include anaphylaxis, causing symptoms like hives, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, tightness of the throat or cardiac arrest. Call 911 immediately if you are showing signs of anaphylactic shock.",

Personally, the only aspect of Costco that I dislike is the large crowds of shoppers. I'm not a fan of being around so many people at once. The trick is to arrive at Costco just as they're opening.\n\nBefore I began working on this article, I posed the following question on my Facebook page, \"What do you LIKE, and what do you DISLIKE about Costco? The following are some of the responses: Keep scrolling after the comments to find out what new changes are in store for 2025.\n\n** Mark W: \u201cKill or be killed\u201d aggressive shoppers. No thanks\n\n** Maura S: Brookfield Costco my only complaint is the parking lot. I feel like I get a lot of great deals. Waterbury Costco has a much better parking lot.\n\nCoronavirus Pandemic Causes Climate Of Anxiety And Changing Routines In America Getty Images loading...\n\n** Marie F: Obnoxious shoppers.\n\n** Lisa W: Great return policy on almost everything. Not always the best price on some things. Cash back on card and further discounts on some things with executive membership. Great quality gasoline and prices\n\n** Keith J: Like: food court. Pizza and hot dog deal. Dislike: crowds. BJs has basically the same stuff and rarely a crowd. Plenty of parking\n\n** Michele T: The slow, get in the way shoppers. When you want to get your stuff and get out, it\u2019s a huge store and it is difficult to get around when you have 3 or 4 people walking side by side strolling as if they had all day to be in there. Having said that \u2026.. I wish they had better hours! Opening at 10:00 is like midday! Open at 7am and we can avoid the casual browsing shoppers. Or be open after 8:30pm!\n\nRetail Sales Numbers Continue To Tumble Getty Images loading...\n\n** Dara O: The LONG lines...\n\n** John B: Keep your calculator handy. Most times retail stores sale prices match the Cosco price per unit (oz, lb, quart, gallon, etc) And ya don't have to buy a barrel or pallet of it.\n\n** Matt CW: Costco is amazing and should be treated as so. I can\u2019t even believe all the naysayers I am seeing in this comment section. Costco is a gift from above.\n\n** Curtis F. We love Costco! From the opening of the store. The dinner Dog and bottomless cup for $1.61 takes me back to 1969, rotisserie chick, awesome. I buy clothes there to do yardwork and play golf.\n\nJay C: like being able to buy a skid of toilet paper or a 55 gallon drum of extra-virgin olive oil. I don\u2019t like that on a weekend the place kinda looks that movie where there\u2019s a revolution going on in some underdeveloped country, and everybody\u2019s at the airport trying to get out. \ufffc Total mayhem and sheer panic.\n\nCoronavirus Pandemic Causes Climate Of Anxiety And Changing Routines In America Getty Images loading...\n\nBarbara WC: I hate that they don\u2019t have signs. They want you to wander\u2026. To find things. But I like their chicken breast bites, smoked salmon, organic fruits, soup in the cold case, and artisan bread.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this article!

            "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) which saw its share price drive 235% higher over five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 10%.\n\nIn light of the stock dropping 3.4% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Costco Wholesale\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Costco Wholesale achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 27% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 60.68.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNasdaqGS:COST Earnings Per Share Growth February 25th 2025\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Costco Wholesale's TSR for the last 5 years was 264%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!",

Changes in the way jobs are done, changes in the medical field, changes in places that are open and closed, and changes in the country.

Sometimes an item that someone enjoys will go away, and over time a replacement will be found, or the shopper learns to live without it. Recently, Costco made a change that even after some time, still has customers upset and demanding things to be changed back to the way they used to be.\n\nChange With Costco Muffins\n\n\n\nCredit: Omar Abascal on Unsplash Credit: Omar Abascal on Unsplash loading...\n\nLate last year Costco made a change that upset many customers. They took the infamous muffins that were well-sized, delicious, and offered a chance to mix and match 6 packs to form a dozen for $9.99. They made the switch to an 8-count of muffins, making them smaller, but lowering the price to $6.99. In retrospect, this is a worse deal as you could get 24 big muffins for $19.98 and now can get 24 smaller muffins for $20.97. Not only has the size changed, but being unable to mix and match is disappointing, as well as some flavors have gone away too.\n\nCostco Muffins Upsetting Customers\n\nCredit: Alina Karpenko on Unsplash Credit: Alina Karpenko on Unsplash loading...\n\nIt has been a couple of months since this change has taken place, and many customers are continuing to complain, begging Costco to return to the old 12-count, mix and match, and bigger muffins. One of the biggest complaints is that not only have they changed the count, size, and flavors, but also they have changed the recipe. Many customers have complained that the muffins are not as delicious as they once were, adding to more frustrations from customers. It may not seem like a big deal to all who shop at Costco, but for those who enjoy their muffins, it has been frustrating. The customers are not the only ones upset though, as employees are as well, being the ones that have to deal with complaints each day.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nThe hope is that Costco will listen to the complaints and their customers and make a change in the near future, by reverting back to the old recipe, prices, size, and variety. Taking away the freedom to choose by mixing and matching is taking away freedom from customers, and limiting their selection, by asking them to pay more for a smaller and less delicious muffin. Costco, listen to your customers and make a change, we beg you.\n\nMagic Valley Photogenic Foods Gallery Credit: Restaurants",

At AS USA, Maite combines her knowledge of political economy and personal finance to empower readers by providing answers to their most pressing questions.\n\nAs inflation continues to drive up the price of groceries, housing, and other essential goods and services, some consumers have had enough. As tensions rise and anger grows, one organization is giving people a tool to fight back. The People\u2019s Union USA, an organization that describes itself as a \u201cgrassroots movement dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform,\u201d has called for an \u2018Economic Blackout,\u2019 or boycott, to take place on Friday, February 28.\n\nWhat is the People\u2019s Union?\n\nThe People\u2019s Union seeks to bring people of different political affiliations, races, faiths, and genders together to \u201cfight for fairness, economic justice, and real systemic change.\u201d\n\nThe Instagram account linked to The People\u2019s Union brings users to the profile of John Schwarz, the group\u2019s founder. The organization\u2019s website hosts a short biography of Schwarz, where he explains that he is \u201cjust a man who has lived through struggle, seen the truth, and decided to do something about it.\u201d Schwarz has amassed 236,000 followers on Instagram and recently posted a video explaining the purpose of the boycott planned for Friday.\n\nWhat you need to know about the \u2018Economic Blackout\u2019\n\nIn the post, he alludes to the powerful having ignored the power that sits with the people for too long. He also encourages those viewing the video to participate in the one-day boycott, naming companies like Amazon and Walmart as targets. Though Schwarz projects confidence in the power consumers hold, and the boycott has been noticed and picked up by some celebrities, history shows that these efforts are often ineffectual.\n\nTargeted boycotts that take place over a longer period of time, pick up additional followers and receive political backing have been shown to be effective. A reseracher at Northwestern University, found that the success of a boycott often has to do with the media coverage it is given. The People\u2019s Union is unlikley to find an ally in corporate media, but the agency has so far grown without the megaphone that those outlets could provide. The spread of Schwarz\u2019s call to avoid corporations for one day is clearly resonating with many people online and he has already announced a slew of days and weeks of action to take place through April.\n\nFebruary 28: 24-Hour Economic Blackout \u2013 No spending for one full day.\n\nMarch 7-14: Amazon Blackout \u2013 No Amazon purchases, no Whole Foods, no Prime orders.\n\nMarch 21-28: Nestl\u00e9 Blackout \u2013 Boycotting Nestl\u00e9-owned brands due to water exploitation, child labor, and corporate greed.\n\nMarch 28: 24-Hour Economic Blackout #2 \u2013 No spending for one full day.\n\nApril 7-13: Walmart Blackout \u2013 Shutting down spending at one of the biggest price-gouging, worker-exploiting corporations.\n\nApril 18: Economic Blackout #3 \u2013 Another full 24-hour halt to the economy.\n\nApril 21-27: General Mills Blackout\n\nRelated stories\n\nAfter the boycott set to take place on Friday, a week-long boycott of Amazon will begin on March 7. \u201cNo Amazon purchases, no Whole Foods, no Prime orders,\u201d says the People\u2019s Union.\n\nGet your game on!

As the name indicates, there\u2019s nearly a full year behind this specialty cheese\u2019s complex, savory flavor, and a half pound of it will go a long way \u2014 I\u2019ll be crumbling the intense and admittedly pricey dairy product on salads all week long.\n\nWhat about $19 for a single strawberry? That seems well beyond the point of reason to me when it comes to grocery prices, but according to content creators who have been posting their reviews of a very special strawberry over the past few days, it might be the appropriate price to pay for a perfect piece of fruit.\n\nMultiple users have posted clips of themselves trying the luxury berries they purchased at upscale Los Angeles-based grocery chain Erewhon, with the reviews quickly racking up millions of views throughout last weekend. It\u2019s no surprise that these videos garnered so much attention \u2014 in addition to their $19 price tag per fruit, these berries from luxury Japanese fruit vendor Elly Amai come packaged individually, set on a soft cushion inside a miniature plastic cloche to protect the strawberry.\n\nSome content creators say this is the best strawberry they\u2019ve ever had, while others note that it\u2019s delicious but doesn't merit the hefty cost. Whether or not you\u2019re willing to spend the dough is up to you \u2014 although I think we can all agree these aren\u2019t the kind of berries you\u2019ll be packing in your kids lunchboxes or turning into a big batch of jam \u2014 but before you decide to splurge on a single strawberry, there are a few questions about what this fruit is and what makes it remarkable that you may want answered.\n\nWhat is the $19 strawberry from Erewhon?\n\nElly Amai is the ultra-luxe fruit purveyor that distributes and sells these strawberries, but it isn't the farm that grows them. These are Tochiaika strawberries, grown on a farm named Anhay in the Tochigi prefecture of Japan. Tochiaika strawberries are a fairly new variety \u2014 developed through crossbreeding over the course of seven years, starting in 2011 \u2014 and it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re grown in Tochigi, a prefecture that\u2019s often nicknamed Japan\u2019s \u201cstrawberry kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhat makes them so prized? These delicate berries are known for their heart-shaped profile when sliced down the middle, but above all else, their perfectly sweet taste. Per information that Elly Amai shared with Erewhon, these berries are not sour at all, and the vendor explains that high quality strawberries in Japan are those that have minimal acidity. The berries are only in season from December to June, which explains why you\u2019re seeing them crop up in stores now.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of visibility into why this specific variety of strawberries is so expensive, but it\u2019s likely thanks to the same factors that have made other high-end fruit from Japan pretty pricey. Luxury Japanese fruit is typically grown in smaller crops, and meticulously cared for to ensure that the produce being sold looks and tastes perfect. In this case, that means a medium-large berry with a flawless red exterior, heart-shaped profile, and very sweet flavor. If a strawberry isn\u2019t pristine, it won\u2019t be sold.\n\nThe high-priced berries come from luxury fruit purveyor Elly Amai. Courtesy of Erewhon / Elly Amai\n\nThis attention to perfection extends to when the berries must be eaten. They are at peak ripeness for a very brief time and arrive at an Erewhon location within 24\u201348 hours of being harvested to ensure their quality doesn\u2019t degrade before purchase.\n\nAccording to Elly Amai, the price that customers are paying at Erewhon is similar to what you\u2019d pay for these berries in Japan. It even notes that the Tochiaika berries might be slightly less expensive in the United States because the purchasing power of the Japanese yen is at an all-time low, and Elly Amai receives lower rates for introducing farmers to new markets. While the purveyor does mention that the airfreight cost of shipping a berry to the United States is almost equal to the price of the fruit, it does not detail how this impacts the final cost to American versus Japanese consumers.\n\nHow are you supposed to eat it?\n\nDo not cook this strawberry no matter what. In fact, you don\u2019t even need to slice it \u2014 as its presentation indicates, the berry is delicate, and its vendor recommends that you simply eat it from your hand. Besides Elly Amai's suggestion, other resources on Tochiaika strawberries also say that they are usually eaten by hand.\n\nThe method of consumption for these berries gets even more specific than that. Their purveyor notes that you should only touch the fruit with your bare hands if you plan to eat it within three to four hours. Elly Amai also recommends letting the strawberries breathe at room temperature for roughly 15 to 30 minutes before eating them, to elicit their aroma and sweetness. This might sound silly, but considering that content creators have said a single fruit made their entire car smell like strawberries, it could be worth it.\n\nIf you want to try one of these berries for yourself, you\u2019ll likely need to source them from Erewhon. It seems that Elly Amai has plans to directly sell full boxes of high-end Japanese strawberries through its website, but they're not currently available for purchase, and the web page for these berries doesn\u2019t note if they\u2019re the Tochiaika variety.\n\nSo how can you snag a coveted $19 strawberry? Erewhon notes that they're selling quickly, and are exclusively available at the grocery store's locations in Beverly Hills, Pasadena, and Santa Monica. These stores will be receiving a large re-stock of the berries this Thursday, with more arriving next week, and customers can purchase the fruit via the Erewhon app for delivery or pickup from these locations. Score some as soon as they're re-stocked, then film a review in your car \u2014 maybe you'll even go viral.\n\n",

Bernie Sanders' visit.\n\nThe flyers say Costco has spread \"anti-union propaganda\" and violated worker's rights by \"blocking the distribution of pro-union materials in break rooms,\" which prompted the Teamsters to file a charge against Costco management in Coralville.\n\n\"Costco should respect their employees' rights under federal law to organize with their coworkers,\" Teamsters 238 Secretary-Treasurer Jesse Case said in a statement. \"When good companies like Costco violate workers' rights, it comes across as petty and unnecessary.\"\n\nThe Iowa City Press-Citizen filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Labor Relations Board for the Teamsters' filing. Specifics about the charging document were not immediately available Monday afternoon.\n\nMore: Bernie Sanders says Iowa Democratic Party has 'itself to blame' for losing Iowa Caucuses\n\nTeamsters warn of 'anti-union' literature and layoffs\n\nA letter to Costco employees posted on the Teamsters 238 website warned that company management may engage in group or one-on-one meetings, will \"likely distribute anti-union literature,\" and may replace managers.\n\n\"Don't buy any of it,\" the letter read. \"While employers love to play nice during a union organizing drive and bribe employees with promises and pizza parties, they always revert to the same old way of doing business once the organizing drive is over.\"\n\nTeamsters 238 represents thousands of workers across Iowa as part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a nationwide union that represents millions of workers in the state.\n\nCostco employee speaks at Bernie Sanders event in Iowa City\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, in his Saturday visit to Iowa City, was preceded by several speakers highlighting some of his talking points, including a former park ranger, a University of Iowa student, a union head and VA nurse and a local Costco employee.\n\nSandy Burkey took the stage in front of the capacity crowd at the Englert with emotion. She has worked at Costco for a \"long time\" and is the local produce supervisor. Burkey loves her job, she said, but compared when she started working there, things have \"gone downhill.\"\n\n\"We used to be valued. We used to be more than just numbers to the company,\" Burkey said. \"And it's time that we remind Costco that we are the company.\"\n\nMore: Bernie Sanders slams Donald Trump, Elon Musk in 'Fighting Oligarchy' stop in Iowa City\n\nThe address prompted cheers and claps from the packed theatre. Burkey also urged community members not to boycott the store, but to stop by, say 'hi' and help provide courage to continue fighting for unionization.\n\n\"We need your support, and we need the courage to keep going,\" Burkey said. \"And we're asking you to join our community coalition for worker's rights. We're asking you to follow us and help us join the other 18,000 Costco Teamsters.\"\n\nLocal senator voices support of Costco employees\n\nState Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, also voiced support for Costco employees unionizing in the district he represents.\n\n\"Workers in Coralville and across Iowa deserve the freedom to organize without interference from management,\" Wahls said. \"Costco's actions undermine the fundamental rights of its employees. I stand with these workers and the growing coalition fighting to ensure their voices are heard.\"\n\nRyan Hansen covers local government and crime for the Press-Citizen.

            "content": "It turns out that bacon is a rather controversial food. When I accepted the job to test it, I did so without hesitation. After all, I love bacon, and I knew that I could easily recruit some volunteers to help me find the best one. What I learned from testing is that while yes, everyone likes bacon, when it comes to choosing the best, it\u2019s not so simple or clear-cut.\n\nFor example, I like bacon that\u2019s ultra-crispy and cut thick enough so that it doesn\u2019t shatter when I pick it up. It can\u2019t be too greasy, and it must actually taste like bacon. (It sounds obvious, but we tested some that didn\u2019t...I know!) Other testers cared more about the size of the strip, and also preferred a chewy versus crispy bacon slice.\n\nWith all of these varying opinions, I had to change the way the results were shared. You\u2019ll see what I mean below. Even so, the results were quite surprising, with a few generic brands coming out on top. Here are the bacon brands we tested, and our thoughts.\n\nSara Haas\n\nHow I Selected the Bacon to Test\n\nTo keep things as fair as possible, I purchased bacon that can be commonly found in large grocery store chains. I also included store-brand varieties from Whole Foods, Aldi, Target, and Costco. I chose only full-fat bacon without any salt reduction or added flavors or sweeteners as indicated on the packaging (in other words, nothing that said \u201chot honey\u201d or \u201cmaple\u201d).\n\nIf the brand had multiple types of bacon, I selected the most straightforward preparation, which was often smoked and labeled as \u201chickory\u201d or \u201capplewood.\u201d I included two thick-cut bacon brands by request, but otherwise, the bacon was what we\u2019ll call \u201cregular cut,\u201d meaning it wasn\u2019t designated as thick or thin.\n\nSara Haas\n\nHow I Cooked the Bacon\n\nTo achieve the best crispy bacon for the test, I chose the chef-approved method of cooking the bacon in the oven. I lined a large baking sheet with foil, then topped it with an oven-safe wire rack. I placed strips of bacon on the rack and baked until done, which was about 20 minutes in a 400-degree F oven.\n\nSara Haas\n\nHow We Tested the Bacon\n\nThis was a concealed taste test, meaning my testers didn\u2019t know which brand they were trying. Each slice was numbered and displayed on a plate. I asked them to rank the bacon in order from least to most favorite. Unlike other taste tests, I didn\u2019t provide any parameters, and instead asked them to be ready to back up their choice when testing was complete. Here are the results.\n\nThe Best Bacon, According to a Taste Test\n\nFor clarification purposes, I\u2019ve opted to categorize the results. Each variety of bacon can be found in one of three categories: the Basic Bottom, the Average Joes, and the Winners. I\u2019ve explained them below.\n\nThe Basic Bottom\n\nBacon that landed in this category was found either unpleasant or simply unimpressive. Testers agreed they wouldn\u2019t buy these again.\n\n10th Place: Hormel\n\nSara Haas\n\nHormel was our least favorite and everyone had something to say. Some of my personal favorite comments were, \u201csuper not good,\u201d and \u201cthis tastes like fat.\u201d In other words, it wasn\u2019t for us. It was greasy and messy and not fun to eat.\n\n9th Place: Target\n\nSara Haas\n\nWe couldn\u2019t figure out how this gets sold as bacon. It tastes nothing like it. Instead, it tasted like soap with a chemical flavor.\n\n8th Place: Oscar Meyer\n\nSara Haas\n\nThis is super basic bacon. It cooked up crispy, but left a lot of fat and grease behind on the plate. One tester said it was \u201cho-hum\u201d and another claimed it \u201cwasn\u2019t worth\u201d whatever I paid for it. Ouch.\n\n7th Place: Smithfield\n\nSara Haas\n\nThis bacon almost landed in \u201cThe Average Joes,\u201d but it was the grease that prevented it from getting there. Most testers found the flavor to be \u201cdecent,\u201d but it came out quite greasy, which kept it from ranking any higher than seventh place.\n\nThe Average Joes\n\nThis is the \u201caverage\u201d group. The bacon in this category was labeled as \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cpretty good,\u201d but lacked any characteristics that made it stand out in a particular way.\n\n6th Place: Whole Foods (365)\n\nSara Haas\n\nTesters said this bacon didn\u2019t seem as fatty as others, but were surprised at how greasy it was after cooking. They liked its meaty texture, but felt it lacked flavor. Overall they said it was \u201cfine\u201d and a \u201cnice choice\u201d for sandwiches.\n\n5th Place: Costco (Kirkland Signature)\n\nSara Haas\n\nThis thick-cut bacon gets high praise across the internet, but testers weren\u2019t that impressed. Perhaps the allure has something to do with the fact that you can get three whopping pounds of bacon for around $15. Since my testers didn\u2019t know this, it didn\u2019t factor into their decision-making. They thought it was meaty, but \u201cmeh\u201d when it came to flavor, which is why it landed in fifth place.\n\n4th Place: Applegate\n\nSara Haas\n\nThe bacon was crispy and exactly what you\u2019d expect if you ordered bacon at your favorite breakfast spot. It\u2019s good, but fell a bit short when it came to flavor.\n\nThe Winners\n\nLike the name implies, this category of bacon includes the best of what we tested. Testers were unanimous in their love for these three, as well as the ultimate winner.\n\n3rd Place: Wright\n\nSara Haas\n\nOut of the two thick-cut bacon varieties on the list, this was the winner. It was meaty and smoky and chewy, like a cross between jerky and bacon, which made for a tasty experience. If you like a heartier bacon, this is the one you need to try. It\u2019s even chef-approved!\n\n2nd Place: Trader Joe\u2019s\n\nSara Haas\n\nThis bacon was a close contender for first place thanks to its almost buttery taste and crispy texture. Like the winner, it had good porky bacon flavor, amplified by a nearly perfect salt level. If you frequent Trader Joe\u2019s, you\u2019ll want to pick up a package on your next run.\n\n1st Place Winner: Aldi (Appleton Farms)\n\nSara Haas\n\nEvery taster agreed this was their favorite. Even though the strips cook down significantly, this bacon hit differently than the rest. It was crispy, it wasn\u2019t greasy, and it tasted so delicious. It had the saltiness we loved but also a bit of smokiness to keep things interesting. In even more great news, a pound of it costs less than $4.50. As if we needed another reason to love Aldi.",

The late investor Charlie Munger had some simple advice: stick to your \"knitting.\"\n\nCostco chairman Hamilton \"Tony\" James, who has sat on the company's board since 1988, talked about Munger's advice for the company in an interview with Chief Executive magazine published Thursday.\n\nMunger was a prominent investor, business partner of Warren Buffett, and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway from 1978 until his death in 2023. He was on Costco's board for more than a quarter of a century.\n\n\"For a giant company like Costco with huge pressures, understanding what's going on can be complex and confusing, but not for Charlie, who had an unerring compass to see through it all to stay on the right path,\" James said. \"That made him an extremely valuable board member.\"\n\nMunger's advice to Costco as a board member was to \"stick to our knitting, our values and our principles,\" James said.\n\n\"Charlie understood we didn't have to do anything different than that,\" James added. \"His voice was very strong and clear on the matter. He'd remind us, 'The right thing for the long term is what we've always been doing, so let's not get confused.'\"\n\nAs for Munger's interactions with Costco's board and leadership, and vice versa, James said they never put him on a pedestal.\n\nThey would debate and always felt free to disagree or even ignore Munger's advice \u2014 something James said that \"you did that at your peril.\"\n\nA self-proclaimed \"total addict\" of the store, Munger once said he loves \"everything about Costco.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to sell a share,\" he added at the time.\n\nMunger was one of Costco's largest individual shareholders. In November 2022, he owned more than 187,000 shares in Costco.\n\nThe company has in many ways followed Munger's advice in doing what it's always done.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example: The company has charged $1.50 for its food court hot dog and soda combo since 1985.\n\nWhen Costco's former CEO, Craig Jelinek, once approached Sinegal, who was then still CEO, about raising the price, Sinegal told him, \"If you raise the [price of the] effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.\"\n\nAlso in the interview, James talked about Costco's approach to generating business from wealthier members.\n\n\"Affluent people love a good deal,\" he said.\n\n\"Since the beginning, we've always known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great \u2014 Rolex watches, Dom Perignon, 10-karat diamonds,\" he told Chief Executive magazine. \"A Porsche dealer in Seattle put their cars on the floor of a Costco, and they sold out in a week.\"",

One Reddit poster shared photos of watches seen at Costco about a decade ago: A white gold Rolex was retailing for $25,999.99 and a stainless steel one for $3,999.99.\n\nAlthough Costco is known for bargains, James stressed that the company is \u201cby no means a dollar store.\u201d He said that Costco is the world\u2019s biggest retailer of Dom Perignon, which normally sells for well north of $200 a bottle. (If you\u2019re looking to splurge, you can put down $17,499.99 for Costco\u2019s presale of a 24-bottle Dom Perignon collector\u2019s pack.) High-end alcohol sales are nothing new for Costco enthusiasts. In 2023, a rare cabernet sauvignon with a 12-year waiting list materialized at California Costcos.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThen, of course, there are the gold bars, which have reportedly been selling for $2,689.99 per 1-ounce bar. Those willing to put down the cash have apparently found their investment worthwhile; the item has 4.8 stars out of 5 from 4,300 reviews.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if affluent people are buying them or just people suspicious of the economy,\u201d James said. \u201c... My point is we\u2019re not interested in selling just anything at a low price. If someone wants to buy a $500 TV for $250 at Costco, we want to sell them a $1,000 TV for $500 instead.\u201d\n\nJames is a longtime Costco board member, having served as a director since Aug. 1988.

Shoppers have noticed some of their favorite items have gone up in price, some quite significantly, with no signs of when they might go back down again. While prices vary across the country due to different markets and suppliers, certain items seem to be more expensive across the board. Here are 7 Costco products that have quietly gone up on price recently.\n\nKirkland Butter\n\nKirkland Signature Grass-Fed butter has become more expensive to stock up on. \"I live very close to Costco and visit multiple times a week. Last week butter was in the $13 range and this last week it went up to around $14.68. Probably about a $1 jump,\" one shopper said. \"Yep.

And the online two pack went from (I believe) $56.99 to $63.99,\" one disappointed member shared. \"I noticed the other day, I regret not stocking up more,\" another responded.\n\nKirkland Cooking Oil\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Vegetable Oil has almost doubled in price for some members. \"Kirkland Cooking oil went up from $6 to around $11 last month,\" one shopper commented. This is clearly an issue across the nation as the price is currently $14.99 in Los Angeles.\n\nCanned Salmon\n\nKirkland Signature Wild Alaskan Pink Salmon has had a steep price hike, customers say, noticing it's significantly more expensive to buy these days. \"Canned salmon went up $5 from $15 to $20,\" one Redditor noted.\n\nCostco Steak\n\n\"I've seen prices being raised twice already in December for ribeye and I'm sure all other meat as well. Any idea what's going on? This is getting ridiculous,\" one Redditor ranted. \"I'm seeing noticable higher prices for Costco Rib Eye steaks, what seemed to be around $45-$50 maybe 6+ months ago is now in the $60 range (California),\" another agreed.\n\n7 Brand-New Costco Items Shoppers Call 'Best of the Month'\n\nKirkland Butter Croissants\n\nCostco shoppers were appalled when the fan-favorite bakery croissants went up from $5.99 to $6.99. \"It's only a dollar, but that is still a 20% increase which has been typical at Costco lately,\" one shopper said. \"It could soften the blow if the price rises would be more gradual. On the other hand, Panera's croissants are $2.99 each, and they are probably fresher and better, but that is six times more expensive. I have found the only way to buy 12 croissants is to put 5 in a freezer bag and freeze them, 5 in a freezer bag in the refrigerator, and 2 get eaten first. The toaster oven is a very effective way to warm them up.\"",

            "content": "Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon products that were recalled in October 2024 have officially been re-classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class I recall.\n\nThe updated classification, indicating the FDA\u2019s highest risk level, cautions that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d the recalled item could cause \u201cserious adverse health consequences or death.\u201d\n\nAn enforcement report sent to TODAY.com by the FDA lists the new classification date as Jan. 22, 2025. It notes that products subjected to the notice were shipped to a distribution center and retail stores in Florida.\n\nA press release regarding the safety notice was first issued on Oct. 25, 2024, and remains ongoing due to concern over potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes. At the time of the recall notice, buyers of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon were encouraged to return or discard products subjected to the recall.\n\nThe lot number can be found in the upper righthand corner of the product packaging, as shown by the green rectangle in this photo shared by Acme Smoked Fish Corp.\n\nThe recall was initiated voluntarily in October by Acme Smoked Fish Corp., a company that provides smoked salmon to Costco under the warehouse store\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment on the Jan. 22 classification update.\n\nIn its initial Oct. 22 letter to Costco members, Acme Smoked Fish Corp. said it was issuing the recall \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause a listeriosis infection, with symptoms that may include fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.\n\nListeriosis is often not dangerous for people with healthy immune systems, but it can be dangerous or life-threatening for pregnant people, individuals over 65, or people with weakened immune systems, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nCheck your products for the recall\n\nThe Costco smoked salmon recall only affects packages of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon with the lot number 8512801270. The lot number can be found on the front of the package above the \u201cBest By\u201d date.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. says customers who have purchased smoked salmon with the above lot number should not consume the products, and should return the products to Costco for a refund.\n\nThe company also advised consumers to call Acme Smoked Fish Corp. at 718-383-8585 with any questions or concerns.\n\nThis recall comes after Costco also recalled certain chicken products over listeria concerns in October 2024. Those recalls were part of a wider recall of ready-to-eat poultry that affected certain products sold at stores nationwide, including Aldi, Walmart, Target, Giant Eagle, HEB, Trader Joe\u2019s and Kroger.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

What's not to love? Unfortunately, according to Reddit users, the answer could be Kirkland's variation of the dish. On the aisles of Costco, its packs of lobster bisque are officially unlovable. The famously budget-friendly chain might have cut back a little too much; customers report decreased quality, specifically referencing less lobster meat in recent packs.\n\nThe unfiltered reviews get progressively worse. Too salty, overly sweet, poor texture \u2014 the list goes on. One thread titled \"Kirkland Lobster Bisque \u2014 offensively bad,\" cited a watery consistency and bland flavor. Commenters jumped on the bandwagon, with a particularly scorned user typing, \"I did get a small piece of shell, so I know some lobster got in the vicinity.\"\n\nAmongst the few customers rushing to the soup's defense, the general consensus was that Kirkland's Lobster Bisque was not fit to be a standalone dish. Some successfully incorporated the soup into a lobster ravioli sauce. If you've already purchased a multi-pack, there's hope if you embrace creativity. Overall, though, the disappointing verdict is that Kirkland doesn't come through with the rich and creamy lobster bisque recipe it promises.

The group resubmitted their proposal in October after receiving feedback from the county\u2019s Development Review Committee (DRC) but there have been no updates on the project since.\n\nThe latter proposal painted a clearer picture of the potential project, but developers still haven\u2019t received a development order from the DRC to start the process. It takes 110 days to build a Costco store, according to their 30-year partner MG2, so the retailer could still open its first Pensacola store this year if the proposal is approved in the near future.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pensacola-area residents should know about Costco in the meantime.\n\nEscambia's latest Publix opening soon: Publix is opening another Pensacola store.

Nine Mile Road.\n\nThe resubmission came four months after developers filed their plans with the county for the first time.\n\nIn the October filing, developers also proposed the Costco building to be 172,580 square feet with a nearby gas station and 885 parking spaces, upping their initial plan for the store to have nearly 162,000 square feet.\n\nPlanet Fitness is the only major business standing inside the plaza\u2019s building, which would need to vacate before Costco could demolish the building.\n\nAn assistant manager at Planet Fitness told the News Journal this week there are no plans to close the gym right now, or in the near future, as far as they know.\n\nSite plans show that Dairy Queen, Sam\u2019s Seafood Restaurant and Wells Fargo on East Nine Mile Road are planned to remain in the plaza if Costco receives the green light on its plans.\n\nThey also show that Costco wants to build the gas station in between Sam\u2019s Seafood and Wells Fargo.\n\nCostco has not responded to the News Journal\u2019s inquiry into the potential Pensacola store at this time.\n\nDo I need a membership to shop at Costco?\n\nCostco requires in-store shoppers to have a membership and you also have to be at least 16 years old to apply.\n\nNon-members can use gifted Costco Shop Cards to make in-store purchases, according to Costco's website, but they would need to be accompanied by a Costco member.

It\u2019s a lot like \u201cstealth wealth\u201d as it also indicates having wealth but not being flashy or boastful about it. But there\u2019s more to it than that; it\u2019s also got an aesthetic aspect. Quiet luxury, when describing fashion or d\u00e9cor, indicates timelessness and simplicity. It\u2019s elegant, regal and minimalist. Quiet luxury is not only a manner of living, it\u2019s also, perhaps even more so, a manner of looking.\n\nCheck Out: 6 Little Luxuries To Buy at Costco This Winter\n\nLearn More: 4 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money That Actually Work\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of momentum around this phrase.

It\u2019s available in navy or white and sells at Costco for $54.99.\n\nGeometric Wall D\u00e9cor Panels\n\nQuiet luxury is subtle and understated, so you don\u2019t want to have any art that brings a garish or loud feel to your space.

We're always trying to find better items to sell to members, giving them a great deal. We're by no means a dollar store.

I adore Costco. I go there at least twice a month, if not every week. I stock my pantry with mostly Costco products. Peek into my fridge and you\u2019ll find that most of my cheese was purchased there. If I\u2019m pressed for time, I rely on the frozen foods that are always staples on my Costco list to help me get dinner on the table fast.\n\nA lot of the products I buy from Costco are its store-brand, Kirkland Signature, including olive oil, nuts, feta cheese, even my daughter\u2019s favorite leggings. But there are plenty of Kirkland-brand items I push my shopping cart right past as I peruse the aisles.\n\nOn my last trip, I decided to give five new-to-me Kirkland Signature products a try. And four of them were so good, they\u2019ve gained permanent spots in my home.\n\nFive-Cheese Tortelloni with Parmigiano Reggiano\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nI have already waxed poetic about my love of the pumpkins and bats ravioli sold at Costco around Halloween, going so far to say that I was planning on stocking up to eat them well into the winter. But I\u2019ve found my new favorite filled pasta\u2014ever. The Five-Cheese Tortelloni with Parmigiano Reggiano is cheesy, creamy and cooks up in minutes. We\u2019ve enjoyed it sauced (with Rao\u2019s from Costco, of course) and in broth along with chopped veggies, and both were delicious meals. I've even started turning half of the package into tortelloni salad for our daughter's school lunch. Look for them in the refrigerated section.\n\nRelated: 10 Comforting Tortellini Dinner Recipes\n\nEverything Bagel Seasoned Cod\n\nEating Well/Instagram\n\nWhile I do typically buy frozen fish at Costco, I haven\u2019t bought any of their seasoned or breaded fish before. And while I like everything bagel seasoning fine enough, I wasn\u2019t as into it as other people were a few years ago when the mix was at the peak of its popularity. Still, the Everything Bagel Seasoned Cod intrigued me. And after we had it once, I will always have it in my freezer until it\u2019s no longer available. I cooked it in my toaster oven air fryer from frozen, and it came out crispy and delicious less than 15 minutes later. We ate it with roasted potatoes and a salad, but I\u2019m really looking forward to turning the fillets into fish sandwiches.\n\nRelated: This Brand Has the Best Everything Bagel Seasoning\u2014and No, It's Not Trader Joe's\n\nLightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nEven though I have a kid, chicken nuggets were never a staple in our house (until recently, I'll get to that). Sure, we\u2019d order them sometimes if we were out to eat, but I didn\u2019t make them at home. Then a local fast-food restaurant opened up and served a salad with chicken nuggets on top, which prompted me to re-create the dish at home. And ever since, it\u2019s been a dinner we make at least once a month. These Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks from Costco will be my go-to for that dinner from now on. They\u2019re made from boneless, skinless chicken breast and cook up nice and crispy.\n\nSupreme Cauliflower Crust Pizza\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nI\u2019m no stranger to cauliflower-crust pizza. My husband avoided gluten for several years, and Milton\u2019s Roasted Vegetable Cauliflower Crust pizza (which can also be found at Costco) was his favorite. So much so that we still buy it. I decided to give the Kirkland Signature Supreme Cauliflower Crust Pizza a try, and it was just as good. It\u2019s covered with a generous amount of veggies, including peppers, zucchini and mushrooms, plus sausage and pepperoni. It was very savory and the crust was sturdy like a regular pizza crust. I like to pair it with a simple salad or crudit\u00e9s and ranch. One-quarter of the pizza packs 900 milligrams of sodium, but we only eat this once or twice a month and keep the sodium of our other meals in check otherwise.\n\nRelated: Why Pizza Tastes Better at Restaurants, According to Chefs\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTrying a new product from Costco can feel like a commitment\u2014they don't exactly sell products in small quantities! But it can be worth it, especially if you find something everyone in your household enjoys.\n\nRead the original article on EATINGWELL",

The deli section and freezer cases are full of convenient snacks and entrees, but a few stand out as top choices to stick in the air fryer.\n\nAir fryers use hot air to get the exterior of your food super crispy while heating the inside. They cook faster than most standard ovens, which is why they work so well if you want a convenient snack or meal without sacrificing quality. Because they use air instead of oil, they are easier to cleanup and add fewer calories to your food compared to deep frying. There are plenty of air fryer options that vary based on price, quantity, and extra features.\n\nWhether you're cooking for a crowd or want to enjoy a snack yourself, these are the top picks from the warehouse store to use with your air fryer.",

The drink is available in a handful of flavors that include orange, classic cola, grapefruit spritz and its original flavor: lemon-lime.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn California, it appears that at least for now Slice is only available at Costco locations around Los Angeles, according to the company\u2019s website.

            "content": "Thursday ended up being a somewhat atypical day for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) stock. That was no fault of the retailer, as this usually popular company tends to trade up rather than down.\n\nBut one rival that's often mentioned with it in the same breath posted some discouraging news, and the market punished Costco by association. Its shares declined by 2.6%, while the S&P 500 index only dipped 0.4%.\n\nPeer pressure\n\nSaid rival is none other than the ubiquitous Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and the news item was its just-published, fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 financial results. Although the mighty retailer saw decent growth on the top line on a year-over-year basis, its net income tumbled a bit.\n\nIt did notch beats on both metrics. However, its profitability guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2026 fell notably short of the average analyst estimate.\n\nCostco isn't Walmart, of course. The largest difference between them is that the former operates like a club with a membership requirement. Walmart is effectively a chain of giant supermarkets where anyone can walk in and shop. Still, they operate in the same retail environment, so when there's concern about one, it can be reflected in the other.\n\nInvestor overreaction\n\nPersonally, I found more to like than dislike in the Walmart numbers. International e-commerce was a particular hot spot, rising by a very robust 16% year over year during the quarter. Overall revenue growth topped 4%, showing me that the sprawling company is still finding ways to get people to buy its merchandise. I'm bullish on big retail generally -- and Costco (not to mention Walmart) specifically.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "A threatened strike at 56 Costco stores across six states has been averted for now, as the company and negotiators for the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, reached an 11th hour tentative agreement, the union told CNN early Saturday morning.\n\nFull terms of the deal were not immediately available. Costco did not respond a request for comment. The strike would have been the largest ever at an American retail chain, and the first ever at the big box retailer.\n\nBeyond wages and benefits, the union also had demands regarding seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nThe agreement, announced several hours after the contract expired at 11:59pm PT Friday, does not completely end the threat of a strike. It would still need to be ratified by rank-and-file members of the union at Costco before it goes into effect. Last fall, unionized workers at Boeing voted down a tentative deal its union leadership had reached with the aircraft maker and started a strike that lasted two months. But most tentative deals do result in a final contract.\n\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of its 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would behave been significant for the largely non-union sector of the economy. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers work in grocery stores.\n\nThe specific locations of the unionized stores have not been identified by either the union or company. But the union said they are in six states along the East and West Coasts \u2013 Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia as well as California and Washington state, the latter being Costco\u2019s corporate home. Costco had said on Friday that even if its unionized workers had gone on strike, \u201call of our locations will be open for business this weekend,\u201d an indication that it intended to use management and non-union staff to keep stores operating.\n\nAnd even though the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, it was prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of non-union Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remained on the job. Such a move could have greatly increased the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for other picket lines.\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that \u201cour philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.\u201d\n\nCostco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at non-union stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour, to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\n\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco\u2019s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion \u2014 up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco\u2019s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: \u201cPro worker? Prove it!\u201d and \u201cRecord profits = record contract.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn\u2019t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are officially drivers for third-party delivery services despite exclusively delivering packages for the online retailer, are its employees.\n\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

While most of these signs are white with black lettering, some shoppers have noticed stores using green signs for various items.\n\nWhat a green sign means at Costco Getty Images loading...\n\nAccording to a report from AllRecipes.com, the green signs are there to let shoppers know that item is an organic option.\n\n\"This labeling practice has been gradually implemented in stores over the past decade, but some locations still don't participate in it at all,\" AllRecipes.com reported.\n\nWhat It Means When A Costco Price Ends In 97 Cents\n\nA price ending in $0.97 isn't something a Costco employee pulled out of thin air.\n\nAllRecipes.com says this is a good indication the item's price was recently discounted.

In one, a note written by an employee describes the opossum on arrival: \u201cpanting alot however mobile and alert.\u201d The second shows the opossum being handled by gloved hands, looking none too pleased.\n\nThe organization wrote that with some time in rehab and less baked goods from buy-in-bulk warehouse clubs, the \u201cchoco-holic should be stabilized enough to return to the wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is definitely a little cranky about our strict \u2018zero chocolate\u2019 policy!\u201d the post concluded. \u201cSame, opossum.... same.\u201d\n\nThe opossum is grumpy. Courtesy Laura Stastny/Nebraska Wildlife Rehab\n\nMore than 13,000 people reacted to the post, and 1,400 comments adorned the dessert-downing diva with words of support.\n\n\u201cI would not be mobile nor alert, so good on you possum,\u201d commented one Facebook user.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, if I ate a whole Costco chocolate cake I would probably be panting a lot, too,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cI feel this opossum in my soul,\u201d commented one person, and another added, \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI relate to this opossum on a spiritual level,\u201d added someone else.\n\nYou may be wondering where this cake-chomping champion came from, and as it turns out, she\u2019s a suburban gal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived in this house over nine years, and we\u2019ve never had an animal on our deck,\u201d Kim Doggett, a realtor and resident of Gretna, Nebraska, tells TODAY.com. She says her family happened upon the mousse-munching marsupial in her backyard while preparing to have guests over for a Super Bowl party.\n\nThe opossum chilling after a very filling dessert. Courtesy Hayden Doggett/Kim Doggett\n\n\u201cWe set out food in the winter because it\u2019s just extra fridge space because it\u2019s really cold in Nebraska,\u201d Doggett says, adding that she placed the dessert \u2014 a Kirkland Signature Tuxedo Chocolate Mousse Cake that weighs over 2-and-a-half pounds \u2014 on a coffee table next to an outdoor sectional sofa.\n\nLater, she asked her son Hayden to set some homemade peanut butter protein balls out on the deck next to the cake \u2014 but he ran into a bit of an obstacle.\n\n\u201cHe goes out there, he opens the door, and the next thing I know, I hear him slamming the door,\u201d she says, adding that her son then informed her of the animal lounging on the outdoor sofa.\n\n\u201cI go over, pop open the door, turn the deck light on and it\u2019s laying there on the sectional couch curled up in a ball,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got chocolate footprints all over my new cream deck furniture and the Costco cake is on the ground in front of the couch. There were some crumbs left.\u201d\n\nThey tried to scare it away by making noise. Hayden, a hockey player, even took out his stick to bang on the deck in hopes the opossum would scurry away.\n\nThe Doggett family noticed the critter wouldn\u2019t budge and was panting, so they knew something was wrong.\n\nThe Humane Society takes the opossum to safety. Courtesy Lauren Widing/Kim Doggett\n\nSo, Doggett called the Humane Society, who came and scooped up the opossum with relative ease and kept the creature under its care until the next morning when she was dropped off at Nebraska Wildlife Rehab.\n\nIt turns out, it wasn\u2019t just all that chocolate cake that was making the opossum sick.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing really good, she\u2019s undergoing treatment for lead,\u201d Laura Stastny, executive director of Nebraska Wildlife Rehab, tells TODAY.com. The animal\u2019s current residence is Baldwin Wildlife Center and Hubbard Family Wildlife Hospital, where she is undergoing chelation therapy to reduce the toxicity in her little body.\n\nStastny says lead toxicity in opossums is often found because there\u2019s lead in the soil, and they eat things that are in the ground.\n\nShe says the animal is also showing mild signs of pancreatitis from consuming too much fat. (The cake is 23 grams of fat per slice.)\n\n\u201cShe ate way too much chocolate, and now she\u2019s got some kind of a mildly inflamed digestive tract, but she\u2019s doing fine,\u201d she says.\n\nWho among us hasn't eaten an entire Costco cake in one sitting? Courtesy Hayden Doggett/Kim Doggett\n\nStastny says that the opossum will be back to prowling shape in about a month, once her lead levels are down. The organization plans on releasing her back into her home neighborhood.\n\nThe Doggett family is having a laugh about the whole thing and even named their furry friend \u201cBlossom the Opossum.\u201d\n\nBut what will the family do if she comes back looking for a sweet treat?\n\n\u201cI am sure it\u2019ll be back up on my deck looking for cake,\u201d Doggett says. \u201cIt will not have cake.\u201d",

Costco\u2019s proposed lot with a fueling station is only 132 feet from the 7-Eleven convenience store with gas pumps on the northeast corner of Rattlesnake Hammock Road and Collier Boulevard.\n\nA waiver from the county would be necessary even if Costco moves the proposed location of the gasoline pumps from the northwest corner of the property to elsewhere on the more than 20 acres because the 500-foot stipulation measures from property line to property line.\n\n\u201cThey could move them, but it doesn\u2019t make the requirement for the waiver go away,\u201d said Jaime Cook, director of development review for Collier County government, who attended the meeting. \u201cHonestly, if they could do it that way, they probably would have done that and none of us would be here right now.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the neighborhood information meeting was held, though, shows that Costco has progressed beyond an initial exploratory phase and intends to move forward with a store on that property. Costco plans to continue discussions with the county about the new store, said Brad Wester, vice president of land use and planning for Jacksonville law firm Driver, McAfee, Hawthorne & Diebenow, who represented Costco at the meeting.\n\nThe county\u2019s Growth Management staff still will need to review Costco\u2019s site development plan and other specific details for the project.\n\n\u201cOnce they complete all the staff reviews, it would be scheduled for hearing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cTypically, these items like these waivers go to the hearing examiner. He\u2019s appointed by the board [of county commissioners] and his decision is typically final and it stops there.\u201d\n\nBased on the number of people opposing the project at the neighborhood information meeting, county staff may recommend that the matter be ultimately decided by the county commission, Cook said. According to county code, commissioners can pull any item that they feel they should hear, and based on the meeting turnout and vocal opposition, that is liable to be the case with this issue, she said.\n\nThe meeting\u2019s turnout was orchestrated by Frank Cipolla, a resident of Hacienda Lakes\u2019 Esplanade community.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think they grasp the gravity of putting a monstrosity of a big-box store at this corner; there are two neighborhoods back here,\u201d Cipolla said.\n\nBill Kutner, president of Hacienda Lakes\u2019 Azure homeowners association, expressed concerns about local traffic and safety issues because of additional projects within the Hacienda Lakes planned unit development.\n\n\u201cWe have 2,700 apartment buildings being built, and the Naples Fire Department is straight down this road, which will also cause a delay in services,\u201d Kutner said. \u201cI can tell you that my community is vehemently against this Costco being placed here for a myriad of reasons.\u201d\n\nThe crowd in attendance at the public information meeting grew increasingly louder when some of their questions went unanswered. Cipolla said members of their community are not anti-growth. They just ask Costco to find a more suitable location for a new store.\n\n\u201cWe understand Naples is growing and we appreciate the hard work the city and county are doing to manage that growth. We also understand that Costco wants to serve the growing communities of East Naples and Marco Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wonder, however, with the major intersection of Collier Boulevard and Route 41 not more than two miles south of the proposed site and home to many businesses large and small, including Lowe\u2019s and soon Home Depot, as well as being closer to Marco Island, that there is not a more suitable site which would not be on an already busy corner, right next to a hospital, and easier for Marco Island residents to get to.\u201d\n\nA new store obviously would provide relief for the chain\u2019s busy longtime location on Naples Boulevard in North Naples. That\u2019s why Costco zeroed in on a second home in the Naples area.\n\n\u201cWhen they know the other facility is at its maximum load capacity and it\u2019s older and there\u2019s an emerging, growing population in this area, they decide what the value of the properties are, what\u2019s the right size property for us,\u201d Wester said.\n\nAlthough Costco does not own the East Naples property yet, the company has the exclusive right to buy it because last February the company entered into an option to purchase the real estate from Hacienda Lakes of Naples LLC, according to a property ownership disclosure form filed with Collier County Growth Management. The anticipated closing date for the real estate transaction is Aug. 20, 2025, records show.\n\nCostco expects the entitlement and permitting process to extend through this summer and fall, Wester said. Then, Costco takes about a year to build a new store, he said.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, we don\u2019t have public hearing dates set yet for what we\u2019re doing right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we have to go through this comment response period and all these requests and applications we have in queue with the county.\u201d\n\nWINK News contributed to this report.",

Sure, it's fun to see Coca-Cola experimenting with a fizzy orange flavor and Dr Pepper getting a dark dose of blackberry, but really, it feels like just another day in the food news cycle.\n\n\n\nBut, one soda twist we never expected? The return of a dearly departed \u201880s favorite: Slice Soda.\n\n\n\nOriginally introduced in 1984 as PepsiCo\u2019s answer to Sprite, Slice offered something more than a lemon-lime soda copycat. It stood out for one key reason: real fruit juice. If \u201cWe got the juice\u201d rings a bell, you know exactly what we\u2019re talking about.\n\n\n\nSlice\u2019s 10 percent real juice content gave it a \u201chealthier\u201d image and a variety of unique flavors, including orange, strawberry, pineapple, fruit punch, and grape. It was a household favorite for years, but by the mid-2000s, it had disappeared from stores, leaving fans to believe it was gone for good.\n\n\n\nThat is until it was recently spotted on shelves again.\n\n\n\nNew Slice Soda Now Sold at Costco\n\nThe beverage born to \u201chealthify\u201d the \u201880s soda market is back again\u2014with the same goal. But this time, joining the wave of alternative sodas, Slice has reemerged with a modern, wellness-focused formula.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, PepsiCo has nothing to do with the long-awaited revival. Instead, Slice 2.0 belongs to SujaLife, a company with a fresh vision for the vintage pop.\n\n\n\nGone are the days when Slice\u2019s health claims started and ended at \u201c10% fruit juice.\u201d The new version is packed with prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, and just five grams of sugar (or less), making it more of a gut-friendly treat than a nostalgic sugar bomb. The functional, fizzy drink is designed to do good, not just taste good\u2014and fans are here for it.\n\n\n\nSo far, only Slice Orange and Lemon Lime Soda have been spotted on shelves, but that\u2019s still enough to send members sprinting to the superstore. \u201cI need!!\u201d said one fan. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to stock my fridge with this!\u201d added another.\n\n\n\nLifelong fans of the drink have reported it tastes \"just like [they] remember it.\" But, even if you weren\u2019t around for the original era of Slice, you\u2019ll likely appreciate it all the same. \u201cI never had Slice before today. Great soda and healthy! I wasn't even born when the brand was popular in the 1980s,\u201d shared one fan.\n\nThe eight-pack soda bundle is available now for $12.99 at Costco warehouses in the Southeast and California but will likely be rolling out to more regions soon. \u201cIt\u2019s so good and Costco better always carry it!\u201d one fan pleaded.\n\n\n\nP.S. As one Costco shopper wisely pointed out, it \u201cgoes great with pizza!\u201d So, yes\u2014that\u2019s your sign to grab a hot, cheesy slice from the food court to accompany your Slice on your way out the warehouse door.",

It notes that products subjected to the notice were shipped to a distribution center and retail stores in Florida.\n\nA press release regarding the safety notice was first issued on Oct. 25, 2024, and remains ongoing due to concern over potential contamination of Listeria monocytogenes. At the time of the recall notice, buyers of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon were encouraged to return or discard products subjected to the recall.\n\nThe lot number can be found in the upper righthand corner of the product packaging, as shown by the green rectangle in this photo shared by Acme Smoked Fish Corp.\n\nThe recall was initiated voluntarily in October by Acme Smoked Fish Corp., a company that provides smoked salmon to Costco under the warehouse store\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment on the Jan. 22 classification update.\n\nIn its initial Oct. 22 letter to Costco members, Acme Smoked Fish Corp. said it was issuing the recall \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nListeria bacteria can cause a listeriosis infection, with symptoms that may include fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.\n\nListeriosis is often not dangerous for people with healthy immune systems, but it can be dangerous or life-threatening for pregnant people, individuals over 65, or people with weakened immune systems, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nCheck your products for the recall\n\nThe Costco smoked salmon recall only affects packages of Kirkland Signature Smoked Salmon with the lot number 8512801270. The lot number can be found on the front of the package above the \u201cBest By\u201d date.\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Corp. says customers who have purchased smoked salmon with the above lot number should not consume the products, and should return the products to Costco for a refund.\n\nThe company also advised consumers to call Acme Smoked Fish Corp. at 718-383-8585 with any questions or concerns.\n\nThis recall comes after Costco also recalled certain chicken products over listeria concerns in October 2024. Those recalls were part of a wider recall of ready-to-eat poultry that affected certain products sold at stores nationwide, including Aldi, Walmart, Target, Giant Eagle, HEB, Trader Joe\u2019s and Kroger.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

It's far too easy to over consume certain products when you have a giant tub of it sitting right there on the kitchen counter. This is a problem Costco members know all too well, with some saying they even avoid buying specific \"addictive\" products because they know full-well said items, which are supposed to last for weeks, will disappear like lightning. Here are 11 Costco products members say they can't stop buying.\n\nKirkland Signature Praline Pecans\n\nKirkland Signature Praline Pecans ($16.99 for 2.5 lbs) are hazardous for your health\u2026 and waistline. \"Costco What have I done\u2026 Praline Pecans from Kirkland are so\u2026 addicting. Had praline cookies before and I like them and saw these, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WAS THAT GOOD. What have I done,\" one Redditor said. \"I can't buy them. Too many calories and I can't stop lol,\" another agreed.\n\nTate's Bake Shop Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nTate's Bake Shop Chocolate Chip Cookies are a must-have item, members say (when they can find them). \"I was in Costco a couple years ago or so and they were giving samples of these thin, crispy chocolate chip cookies. Tates,\" one shopper shared. \"The price was reasonable too. I got a case, the person in front of me at the checkstand had a case, the person behind me had a case. Those are the most addictive cookies I've ever run into. Not too long after that, Costco quit selling them. Other stores have them now but they're anywhere from like $4.50 to almost $6 for a pack with 2 wrapped containers with 7 cookies in each one. They're outrageously expensive and outrageously good.\"\n\nChocolate-Covered Almonds\n\nCostco shoppers absolutely love the Kirkland Signature Almonds, Milk Chocolate ($22.99 for 3 lbs). \"Anyone else *obsessed* with the chocolate covered almonds?? I just got these like, not even a week ago. They've been an obsession of mine for at least 10 years. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffdAnyone else? Just me?\" one Redditor posted, sharing a picture of a half-eaten container. \"I'm with you. These are sooooooo good. Had to stop buying them for a bit, I am addicted!\" another responded.\n\n15 Costco Foods Dietitians Say You Should Avoid Right Now\n\nHimalayan Salt Kettle Chips\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Krinkle Cut Kettle Chips, Himalayan Salt are another smash hit with members. \"For me, it's the Kirkland Kettle Brand Himalayan Salt Potato Chips (2# bag). Salty, crunchy, good enough for salsa dipping,\" one Redditor shared.\n\nPeanut Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets\n\nCostco members are obsessed with the Kirkland Signature Peanut Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets ($11.99 for 55 oz). \"I singlehandedly went through two containers in a month and a half. I have since forbidden them from my apartment,\" one shopper said. \"They are good, but I will only buy them on occasion as I know they will not last between us (me and 13yo),\" another agreed.\n\nChicago Mix Popcorn\n\nCostco shoppers are hooked on the G.H. Cretors Chicago Mix Popcorn ($9.99 for 737g). \"Is anyone else disgustingly addicted to G.H. Cretors Chicago Mix Popcorn? Perhaps we can form a support group. Also, I'd like to speak with someone regarding the serving size. It says 'about' 26\u2026. For me it was about 4,\" one Redditor said. \"When I worked there, nothing got people more angry than when we were out of Chicago Mix popcorn. That is, by far, the most addictive food item Costco carried,\" a former employee shared.\n\n7 Costco Frozen Foods Shoppers Say Are \"Must-Buys\"\n\nSalted Caramel Macadamia Clusters\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Macadamia Clusters, Salted Caramel and Milk Chocolate are dangerously addictive, shoppers say. \"These are so good. I only saw them once at my warehouse a few months back and there was only like 20 tubs left. I mistakenly only bought 1,\" one shopper said. \"Don't buy if you have no self control,\" another commented.\n\nMelona Ice Cream Bars\n\nThe Melona Ice Cream Bars are deliciously addictive, members say. \"Melona ice cream bars\u2026 especially the green ones,\" one shopper said. \"Green Melona ice cream is the BESTTT,\" another raved. \"Absolutely this! Hopefully it comes back this summer,\" another added.\n\nLemoncello Almonds\n\nCostco shoppers love the Sconza \u200b\u200bLemoncello Chocolate Almonds whenever they appear. \"Lemoncello almonds\u2026..my son and I refer to them as tasty garlic cloves \ud83d\ude02,\" one Redditor said. \"These things are my favorites as well.

Our Costco only has milk chocolate but the dark chocolate ones are much better!\" one Redditor said. \"I've ruined an otherwise sterling daily calorie count way too many times on these. There's no way to eat just one of them. I can't keep them around anymore, but I'm sure we'll still buy them when they're $3 off again,\" another agreed.\n\n6 Costco Items That Shoppers Say Are \"Worth the Membership Alone\"\n\nDried Mangos\n\nShoppers can't get enough of the Made in Nature USDA Organic Dried Mangos ($64.99 for 28 oz 3-pack). \"It's the absolute best. Perfect blend of sweet and tart. I've tried other dried mangos but I don't even bother anymore,\" one member shared on Reddit. \"As far as high quality dried mango goes, the Kirkland ones are the cheapest I can find.

That's very reasonable.\"\n\nAnd a third added: \"This is my hack with my wife, its cheaper to be honest than any supermarket ingredients.\"\n\nHowever, some did question the quality of the meat you would be getting for that price, especially if it's been in a tube.\n\nOne critic responded: \"Tube meat is nasty.\"\n\nCostco CEO confirms Pepsi has been removed from food courts as popular drink returns for first time in 12 years\n\nAnother person agreed, writing: \"Tube burger is pretty bad.\"\n\nMEAT MADNESS\n\nIn another Costco meat story, a member recently hit the grocery jackpot on their latest shopping run, scoring a mismarked meat product for mere cents.\n\nThe customer came across an 11 pound package of brisket for just $0.11, sparking envy among other Costco fans.\n\nCostco can occasionally have price mistakes, and if you're lucky enough to catch one, you could walk away with a huge discount.\n\nOne shopper shared that they always keep an eye out for the mistakes thanks to the Costco subreddit and finally spotted one on their recent grocery trip.\n\n\"It finally happened! Mismarked brisket,\" beamed the customer in a Reddit post last week, along with an image of the 11.22 pound meat package priced at just $0.11.\n\nCostco membership sharing guidelines Costco has strict rules for membership use that shoppers must follow and they've been cracking down on offenders in recent years.

            "content": "Have you done any muffin shopping at Costco yet this year? Even so, you still might not be aware of a big change the company made to them.\n\nReports began as early as November regarding a possible shakeup at Costco bakeries around Texas and the rest of the country. We can confirm that the changes are not a rumor, but a cold-hard fact. Perhaps enough public outcry can make a difference.\n\nRegarding Costco's muffins, there have been some changes to available flavors. But that's taking a back seat to what some a calling a hidden price hike for the popular muffins. Ahh, yes. It's our new friend shrinkflation.\n\nWhat is shrinkflation? \"This is when a company reduces the size of a product while keeping the price the same. This practice is also known as package downsizing or weight-out.\"\n\nSo, what Costco is doing with its muffins isn't the classic definition of shrinkflation, as they are lowering the price of the package. Folks on Reddit are acknowledging that the price of these muffins has gone down, but their size has shrunk much more.\n\nSo it may look to a lot of people that they're getting a better deal. But not these eagle-eyed shoppers.\n\nAccording to this post on Reddit, \"Costco is getting rid of its mix-and-match 12-count muffins (two packs of six muffins) for $9.99 and replacing the deal with one pack of eight muffins of the same flavor for $6.99.\" Which on the surface feels like a savings. But that doesn't add up,\" says Delish.\n\nThe new ones are estimated to be around 70% of the size of the old ones. Therefore, \"the eight-count muffins are cheaper than the previous 12-count by $3, the math isn't working in customers' favor. One Redditor did some calculations comparing prices and found that the new muffins are a shocking 58% more expensive per ounce.\"",

Specifically, the 90-quart (85 liters) cooler in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The product has been distributed in multiple stores since 2019. Now, it has been recalled due to a serious defect in the handle, which has caused severe injuries to several users.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced that the design of the handle on these coolers can trap consumers' fingers against the body of the product, causing amputations, fractures, and serious injuries. So far, 12 injury cases have been reported in the United States, although there are no reports of incidents in Canada or Mexico.\n\nCostco and Amazon Respond to the Massive Recall\n\nThese products were widely sold on Amazon platforms and in Costco physical stores. Both companies have taken steps to warn customers about the risk and provide information on how to proceed.\n\nAmazon has updated its platform to identify customers who purchased this cooler model and notify them about the recall. It has also provided direct links to manage the request for a free replacement handle through Igloo.\n\nCostco, meanwhile, has implemented an alert system in its physical stores and on its website. The company has directly contacted buyers to recommend that they stop using the coolers immediately and process the solution with the manufacturer. Additionally, it is offering assistance in its customer service centers for those who have questions about the procedure.\n\nMore Than One Million Coolers Recalled in Three Countries\n\nThis recall affects approximately 1.06 million coolers in the United States, 47,000 in Canada, and 23,000 in Mexico. These products were sold at Amazon, Costco, Target, Dick's Sporting Goods, and other stores between January 2019 and January 2025.\n\nThe recalled coolers are available in various colors and have the \"IGLOO\" brand printed on the side. Among the affected models are those marketed under the names Latitude and Maxcold, with prices ranging from 80 to 140 dollars.\n\nHow to Know if Your Cooler Is Part of the Recall\n\nConsumers who purchased this cooler model should check the manufacturing date, which is printed on the bottom of the product. Only units manufactured before January 2024 are included in the recall.\n\nIf you have an affected cooler, Igloo recommends stopping its use immediately and requesting a free replacement handle.\n\nProcess to Request a Replacement Handle\n\nAmazon and Costco customers who purchased one of these coolers can request the replacement part through the following channels:\n\nPhone: 888-943-5182\n\nEmail: igloo90qt@sedgwick.com\n\nOnline registration: Available on Igloo's official website\n\nAmazon and Costco have assured that they will provide support to customers in managing this process and have reaffirmed their commitment to selling safe and quality products.\n\nIgloo Promises to Improve the Safety of Its Products\n\nIn an official statement, Igloo explained: \"With consumer safety as our top priority, we are providing free replacement handles. Through rigorous testing and proactive steps, we are constantly improving our products to meet the highest safety standards.\"\n\nFor more information, authorities recommend visiting the websites of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Health Canada, or the OECD global recall portal.",

Club members aired their annoyance following footage showing shoppers purportedly queuing for refunds as egg costs soar in the US due to a bird flu crisis.\n\nSome who shopped at Costco - who were recently criticized for their 'nuts' DEI hiring stance - were even charged up to $18.69 for five dozen, facing purchase restrictions and having to get to stores early to stand in dedicated lines - with supplies often running out swiftly.\n\nTensions flared when an Instagram video seemed to depict people aiming to return eggs to Costco, which MAGA fans have recently threatened to boycott, that they found cheaper elsewhere, captioned: \"People trying to return more than a thousand eggs a day later because they found them cheaper somewhere else lol. Meanwhile we're in a nationwide egg shortage. Costco activities.\"\n\nSocial media reactions were sharp; one person blasted: \"Selfish, selfish people. Just ridiculous.\" Another raged: \"Don't take the return and cancel the membership that's obscene and ridiculous and unhealthy.\"\n\n(Image: raysbbq90255/Instagram)\n\nSomeone else insisted: \"There should be a no return policy on eggs! I remember there was a NO return on items during Covid so this should apply with eggs!\"\n\nIn a heated online debate, one critic cautioned: \"We don't know how those eggs have been stored or whether they have been tampered with. Absolutely not! \" Another person was baffled, asking: \"I thought Costco made a no return on eggs. Because of the shortage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data reveals egg prices are soaring, hitting a new high in the United States with an average of $4.95 per dozen Grade A eggs in urban areas this January\u2014a leap from the previous peak of $4.82 two years earlier, and sharply up from the August 2023 low of $2.04 as recorded by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Driven largely by the country's worst bird flu outbreak since 2015, the price spike represents about two-thirds of the surge in overall food costs last month, reports the Mirror US.\n\nBut these figures only scratch the surface; in some locales, a carton of eggs can crack open your wallet to the tune of $10, especially if you opt for organic or cage-free eggs which climb even higher in cost. Jon Florey, pondering over his egg choices at Encinal Market in Alameda, California, noted the impact, saying: \"We do use eggs a little less often now. You know, because of the price,\" before adding: \"I was going to make a quiche that I like to make and it's about six eggs, so I figured I'd do something else.\"\n\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here .\n\nThere's no relief in sight for egg prices. They usually surge around Easter due to high holiday demand. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted last month that egg prices were likely to rise by 20% this year. Even if shoppers can afford eggs, they may struggle to find them.\n\nSome supermarkets are having difficulty keeping their shelves stocked, and customers are facing surcharges and limits on how many cartons they can buy at once. Encinal Market owner Joe Trimble said he struggles to get all the eggs he orders from his suppliers, so most of the time his shelves are only about 25% full.",

            "content": "PATRICK T. FALLON / Getty\n\nCola Wars\n\nThe food court might be one of the most beloved parts of a Costco trip. From the $1.50 hot dog combo to the whole pepperoni pizzas, the food is fresh, hot, and inexpensive.\n\nRecently, rumors were swirling that there was going to be a big change coming to the beverage fountain in Costco cafes. Turns out, those \u201cinsider\u201d accounts and websites were correct: Costco is switching from Pepsi to Coke. Here's what we know about the change.\n\nNutthaseth Vanchaichana/istockphoto\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening to Costco\u2019s Soda Fountain?\n\nFor weeks now, Costco Insider and an anonymous source on the Costco Reddit forum have claimed that the soda fountains in Costco\u2019s cafes are going to switch from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola products, and it's proven to be true.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll have drinks like Coke, Diet Coke, and Sprite to choose from instead of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Starry.\n\nFlickr\n\nDidn\u2019t Costco Cafes Have Coke Products Before?\n\nYep! You\u2019re not crazy if you remember getting Coke in the Costco food court before. If you shopped there before 2013, you had Coca-Cola products to choose from.\n\nThe store switched to Pepsi after Coke refused to give Costco as good a deal as the company supposedly gave Walmart. And for about a month, Costco stopped carrying ANY Coke products, not just in the food court.\n\nCheapism\n\nHas Costco Confirmed Anything?\n\nYes! During a Costco annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Costco CEO Ron Vachris confirmed that the soda fountains in the cafe would soon be dispensing Coke instead of Pepsi, according to Business Insider.\n\nIt happened during the question and answer portion of the meeting, when someone asked specifically if Vachris could confirm the rumors.\n\nAnacleto E. / Yelp\n\nWhen is the Switch Happening?\n\nAccording to Vachris, you'll have to wait a little while before you'll be sipping on a Diet Coke during your Costco trip. \"This summer, we will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\" he said.\n\nSo while we don't know exactly when it'll happen yet, you can figure that the switch will happen before the end of August.\n\nwellesenterprises/istockphoto\n\nHow Do People Feel About the Switch to Coke?\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of love lost for Pepsi, honestly. Most Redditors seem excited about the potential switch. \u201cCoke and Sprite lovers rejoice!\u201d said u/Seefutjay. There\u2019s also a large contingent of people who want Dr Pepper, though that\u2019s unlikely given it\u2019s not owned by Coca-Cola.\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of people that don\u2019t really care, of course. \u201cI could deal with it if they were kept calibrated,\u201d said u/FalconFrenulum. \u201cEvery time I go it\u2019s too syrupy or light to the point it tastes like water.\u201d\n\nFor more Costco stories, sign up for our free newsletters.\n\nThis article was originally published on Cheapism\n\nPATRICK T.

The company plans to build the 160,000-square-foot store, 18-pump gas station, and 770-spot parking lot at the corner of Western Avenue and Crossgates Mall Road.\n\nSupervisor Peter Barber during his state of the town address earlier this month said the warehouse price club would be opening in late 2025, \u201clast I heard.\u201d He said, \u201cIt takes four months to build because it\u2019s just a box \u2014 no basement, nothing really specialized about it.\u201d The timing, he said, is dependent on the company having a \u201cbuilding slot.\u201d\n\nBut during the most-recent meeting of the town\u2019s Industrial Development Agency a little more light was shed on the subject.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give the usual comment in regard to the Costco closing. I was in discussion with Pyramid\u2019s representatives about two weeks ago and they told me at that point in time, their best guess for closing was 30 to 45 days, which would put us toward the end of February or early March,\u201d Donald Csaposs, chief executive officer of the IDA, said on Jan. 28.\n\nBut \u201cclosing\u201d isn\u2019t closing in the traditional real-estate sense, Csaposs explained to The Enterprise this week, as Pyramid has already been deeded the land it needs to build the project.\n\n\u201cThere were two things that were taken by eminent domain,\u201d Csaposs told The Enterprise; one was land, the discontinued roads located within the project site. \u201cThe other thing that was taken by eminent domain was the right to eliminate the purported deed restrictions that prohibited non-residential development on certain parcels in the project area,\u201d Csaposs said.\n\nCsaposs said the second eminent domain action applied to properties \u201cwithin the proposed building envelope, so to speak, for Costco, and for three other projects outside the building envelope, but immediately adjacent\u201d to the project.\n\nOf the land taken by eminent domain, Csaposs said, \u201cWe took the land, we transferred it to [Pyramid], we got money from them, and we gave it to the town.\u201d\n\nThe IDA in June accepted a $686,000 appraisal for the 4.23 acres of town-owned property, the roads, within the project site.\n\nBut, Csaposs said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the new deed has been filed at the county clerk yet.\u201d\n\nA map and deed appear to have been filed.\n\nWhat\u2019s meant by closing?\n\nCsaposs explained that his use of the word \u201cclosing\u201d during the January meeting had to do with the IDA approval to provide the project sales and mortgage tax relief.\n\nIn June, members of the IDA board approved Pyramid\u2019s $2.14 million request for sales-tax relief and another $75,000 break in mortgage taxes. At the time, the project had a $41.4 million price tag, with $32.4 million of that coming out of Pyramid\u2019s pocket and the remaining $7.5 million coming by way of private-sector funding, which would become $13 million for which the company would receive $55,000 in additional mortgage breaks.\n\nBetween March and May, overall project costs rose from $39.9 million to $41.4 million, as machinery and equipment costs accounted for the entirety of the increase. Also in May, Pyramid increased its sales- and use-tax exemption request from $5 million to $26.55 million.\n\nThe ask quadrupled the benefit received by the company, from $475,000 to about $2.2 million.\n\nAsked if \u201cclosing\u201d on the sales and mortgage tax relief is something that would hold up construction, Csaposs said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t legally hold up the project,\u201d but if Pyramid were to start construction and \u201cif anything happened to the project that would jeopardize the restrictions on the IDA financial assistance, they could be out that financial assistance.\u201d\n\nThere are two separate things at work, Csaposs said. First, there is the legal process of: Can Pyramid start?\n\nAnd then, there\u2019s the financial process of: Should Pyramid start before it\u2019s closed the transaction that confirms the financial benefit?\n\n\u201cSo, prudent fiscal management dictates you don\u2019t start the project until all the i\u2019s are dotted and the t\u2019s are crossed,\u201d Csaposs said.\n\nAs for why Pyramid has yet to close the transaction, the company did not immediately respond to an Enterprise inquiry.",

[AP Photo/David Zalubowski]\n\nFellow Costco Workers,\n\nThe betrayal of our strike by the Teamsters leadership is a stark warning to all workers: if we are to fight for our interests, we must do so independently. The Teamsters bureaucracy, under the leadership of Sean O\u2019Brien, has once again shown that it serves the interests of corporate management and the political establishment, not the workers who pay their dues.\n\nOn February 1, 2025, 18,000 Costco workers were prepared to launch the largest strike of the new year. We were ready to fight for higher wages, better working conditions, paid family leave, fair scheduling, and an end to the company\u2019s draconian surveillance policies. Instead, in a backroom deal negotiated in the dead of night, O\u2019Brien and the Teamsters announced a sellout tentative agreement designed to smother our struggle before it began.\n\nCostco has raked in over $250 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, with a net profit of $7.3 billion. Its CEO, Ron Vachris, was paid $12.2 million while many of us are expected to survive on $19.50 an hour in grueling conditions, with unpredictable schedules, little time for breaks, and constant understaffing. Meanwhile, the contract we are being forced to accept offers only token raises\u2014insulting, inadequate and utterly unacceptable. The tentative agreement proposed by the Teamsters bureaucracy is an insult to workers and their families.\n\nThe paltry $1 per hour wage increase proposed in the tentative agreement is nothing more than a kick in the teeth, failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living. Additionally, the so-called \u201clabor peace agreement\u201d provision is a naked attempt to further erode the power of collective action, ensuring that workers remain powerless and isolated while the bureaucracy secures its own position as it sells out our existence.\n\nThe Costco Workers Rank-and-File Committee (CWRFC) is being established to take the fight into our own hands. We refuse to allow the Teamsters or any other corporate-controlled union bureaucracy to negotiate away our futures. The union leadership is an extension of the ruling class, deeply tied to both the Democratic and Republican parties, including the fascistic forces gathering under Trump.\n\nThe Teamsters\u2019 ties to the corporate state\n\nSean O\u2019Brien postures as a militant fighter, but his record speaks for itself. His betrayal of UPS workers in 2023 paved the way for mass layoffs and automation, and now he is doing the same to Costco workers. O\u2019Brien has courted Trump and his fascist allies, including Senator Josh Hawley, who aided in the attempted coup of January 6 and was O\u2019Brien\u2019s guest on his podcast. This alliance is not accidental\u2014it reflects the broader shift of the union bureaucracies toward nationalism, anti-immigrant scapegoating, and collaboration with the forces of dictatorship.\n\nBy aligning with Trump, O\u2019Brien and the union apparatus demonstrate their hostility to immigrant workers, who make up a significant portion of Costco\u2019s workforce. Trump\u2019s agenda includes mass deportations, workplace raids and stripping immigrants of basic rights\u2014all with the full backing of both big business parties. Los Angeles is the next target.\n\nThe Costco Workers Rank-and-File Committee stands unequivocally for the unity of all workers, regardless of nationality, color, gender or immigration status. We will not allow our struggle to be divided along the lines of race, nationality, or citizenship.\n\nThe way forward: rank-and-file control\n\nThe Teamsters have made clear that they will do everything in their power to isolate and sabotage our struggle. We must therefore take the fight out of their hands and build a mass movement independent of the union bureaucracy and both corporate-controlled parties.\n\nWe reject the sellout tentative agreement. Instead, we put forward the following demands, based not on what the corporations or their union stooges claim is \u201caffordable,\u201d but on what workers need to live a dignified life:\n\nA $10 per hour across-the-board wage increase over three years for all workers, with automatic cost-of-living adjustments tied to inflation.\n\nA 40-hour workweek with guaranteed full-time positions for all workers who want them, with no forced part-time or precarious scheduling.\n\nComprehensive healthcare fully paid by Costco, including vision, dental, and mental health services.\n\nPaid family leave and bereavement policies that reflect the real needs of workers.\n\nAn immediate end to all workplace surveillance and punitive management practices.\n\nA democratically elected bargaining committee fully controlled by rank-and-file workers, not union bureaucrats or management representatives.\n\nA strike fund controlled by rank-and-file workers to prepare for the next battle if Costco refuses to meet our demands.\n\nUnite with workers across industries!\n\nCostco workers are not alone. Grocery and retail workers across the country\u2014at King Soopers, Kroger, Albertson, Amazon and beyond\u2014are facing the same conditions of low wages, corporate exploitation and union betrayals. The ruling class and its politicians are coordinating their attacks on the working class\u2014we must coordinate our resistance.\n\nThe Teamsters and other unions will try to isolate our struggle, just as they have done to workers at UPS, the railroads and beyond. We must actively reach out and build alliances with workers across industries to prepare a broader fightback.\n\nThe fight against fascism and corporate dictatorship\n\nThe Trump administration represents the interests of a tiny oligarchy of billionaires. It poses a grave threat to the entire working class, especially our immigrant brothers and sisters. His plans for mass deportations and authoritarian rule are being prepared in full collaboration with sections of the trade union bureaucracy, including O\u2019Brien. If we do not take independent action, the danger of dictatorship will only grow well beyond deportations. The fight for better wages and working conditions is inseparable from the fight to defend democratic rights.\n\nJoin the Costco Workers Rank-and-File Committee!\n\nThe Teamsters will not fight for us. The Democrats and Republicans will not fight for us. We must fight for ourselves. That is why we are building the Costco Workers Rank-and-File Committee\u2014to unite workers in a real struggle against corporate exploitation, union betrayals, and the broader assault on workers\u2019 rights and living standards.\n\nIf you agree with this, we urge you to contact us. Help us build a powerful rank-and-file movement, independent of the Teamsters and the political establishment, to take this fight forward.\n\nWe refuse to accept a future of poverty wages, corporate domination, dictatorship and union betrayals. We refuse to let our immigrant brothers and sisters be scapegoated and attacked. We refuse to be divided by the nationalist poison peddled by O\u2019Brien and his fascist allies.\n\nThe time to fight back is now. Join us!",

President's Day is February 17, and one of the best days of the year to get furniture and appliances\u2014especially at Costco, where members are sure to bag an amazing deal. Many of the deals are members-only, and customers love the items. Whether you're looking for a fridge, dishwasher, microwave, or anything else to update your electronics, Costco has you covered. Here are the best deals to score this President's Day.\n\nSamsung French Door Refrigerator\n\nThe Samsung 23 cu. ft. Counter Depth 4-Door French Door Refrigerator ($1,300 off) is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for a beautiful new fridge. \"Probably the best refrigerator I've ever seen,\" one customer wrote. \"Definitely the best I've ever owned. Very well thought out, from the pull out drawers in the freezer, so you're not pawing through a frozen mass to find what you're looking for, to the self-filling pitcher of filtered water in the door. The space is all useful. I thought that I would miss ice in the door, but the two styles of ice ready & waiting in the freezer are more than fine, and you don't end up with ice shards skittering across the floor. We had been looking for the perfect counter-depth refrigerator, when this popped up\u2026 we went for it. We couldn't be happier with it.\"\n\nKitchenAid Hidden Control Dishwasher\n\nThe KitchenAid Hidden Control 44 dBA Dishwasher with PrintShield Finish and FreeFlex Third Level Rack ($500 off) is another great deal. All of Costco's prices include delivery and installation, making ordering a breeze. \"Ordered this online after shopping at all the competition,\" one customer said. \"Price from Costco included extended warranty, delivery, installation. Others did not include extended warranty, delivery was included, installation was as high as $180 with an additional $50 for haul off. These made Costco the choice. Delivery was in 5 days, they were on time, the installer was at my house an hour and a half later that day. The installation and removal was done in less than an hour.\"\n\nWhirlpool Top Control Dishwasher\n\nThe Whirlpool Top Control Dishwasher with Soak and Clean Cycle is $300 off. \"It's a really great dishwasher. I put a glass baking pan in the other day that I was going to soak it had black burnt crust on it and it came out perfect,\" one happy Costco shopper said.\n\n15 Costco Foods Dietitians Say You Should Avoid Right Now\n\nSamsung Convertible Upright Freezer\n\nThe Samsung 11.4 cu. ft. Capacity Convertible Upright Freezer ($160 off) is highly recommended by shoppers. \"This freezer doesn't disappoint,\" one customer said. \"I've been searching for the perfect size vertical frost free freezer for 4 years to fit in my 1 bedroom/1 bath apartment. It's tall but I love its slim width. It's enough room to keep extra frozen food on hand for a small family as long as you're constantly using items and replacing it instead over stocking on things that you may never use in 6 months. If you intend to store items on top of other older items than you may want to buy something a lot bigger. The fact that I do not have to bend my back and dig in piles of stuff is a big win. Vertical Frost free is better buy even if it's a little more expensive.\"\n\nSamsung Bespoke Gas Range\n\nCostco is offering a great deal on the Samsung Bespoke 6.0 cu. ft. Smart Slide-In GAS Range with Convection, Smart Oven Camera, and Illuminated Precision Knobs ($600 off). \"This stove is incredible! It cooks so well,\" one customer said. \"I love the power of the fast burner, the flame is almost too big. My favorite features are the temperature probe that's built in and will shut off the oven when it reaches temp. Downsides: The camera is cool but the food is really hard to see. The app is basically a useless feature since the camera isn't great and you can't preheat it from the app for safety.\"\n\n7 Costco Frozen Foods Shoppers Say Are \"Must-Buys\"\n\nWhirlpool 4 Door Refrigerator\n\nCostco is featuring the Whirlpool 19.2 cu. ft. Counter Depth 4 Door Refrigerator with Easy Shelves at a stunning $1000 off. \"With high food costs, I can no longer ignore food wasting away in the back of my refrigerator,\" one shopper said. \"This refrigerator gives me a great view of all my food. I have been using it for several weeks and find my waste has diminished significantly. I love the way I can organize my food and freezer products\u2026so sensible and easy for me, a short person, to access. What a pleasure! Costco was tops in delivery and the least expensive in price. Kudos to your delivery team and extra warranty \u2014 what a bonus.\"6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\nGE Over-the-Range Sensor Microwave Oven\n\nThe GE Profile 2.1 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Sensor Microwave Oven with Auto Cook and Steam Cook is on sale at $150 off. \"It's really high end looking. Love that it doesn't have a shelf inside,\" one customer said. \"We were always removing with prior micro anyway. Plus it's really thought out. Even the little stuff. Like when you press the 30 second button. One press and it start. No need to press a second button. GE is crazy reliable. Kept our old GE that still runs after 20 years.\"",

However, not everyone is willing to plunk down a yearly fee just for the privilege of shopping at a chain store. Fortunately, there's an alternative for commitment-phobe consumers. Similar to warehouse retail chains like Costco and Sam's Club, WinCo Foods is a bulk grocery retailer \u2014 with one distinct difference. Unlike other stores offering bulk goods, WinCo is accessible to the public, without the need for a membership card.\n\nThere is one minor caveat involving location. WinCo stores can only be found in select states, including Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. On the other hand, Costco has locations situated throughout the U.S. (The only states that lack Costco locations are Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wyoming.) As for Sam's Club, 600 locations are spread out over 45 states. While membership-based chains are a bit more accessible, shoppers in proximity to WinCo Foods can take advantage of the freewheeling concept.\n\nRead more: False Things You Believe About Shopping At Aldi\n\nOther Differences To Expect When Shopping At WinCo Foods\n\nWinCo Foods storefront daytime - Sanfel/Getty Images\n\nWinCo Foods made its debut as Waremart Foods in 1967, with its first location established in Boise, Idaho. Since then, the grocery chain has expanded into several other states, making a name for itself by being an employee-owned company. The chain feels that it's employee stock ownership plan encourages workers to maximize efforts on a daily basis while also offering staff financial rewards when the company's stock performs favorably.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts designation as an employee-owned entity isn't the only notable difference at WinCo Foods. The chain strives to save its shoppers money, which has lead to some key distinctions. For example, to eliminate the fees associated with such transactions, customers cannot pay with credit cards . However, you're free to use a debit card or check to pay for your purchases. As another cost-saving measure, the store doesn't employ baggers , which makes WinCo Foods similar to Aldi. While it might not be an option for every consumer, WinCo Foods does have a lot to offer if you like warehouse retailers but don't necessarily want to get roped into a yearly membership.\n\nRead the original article on Mashed.",

After all, you can\u2019t run out of trash bags halfway through a job and expect a good review! When you need to buy sponges, scrubbers, and soaps in bulk, the first place you think of is Costco.\n\n\n\nWhile the big box store is certainly a favorite for amateur cleaners, it\u2019s also a must-stop spot for the pros looking to stock up on supplies. \u201cThe common saying is quality over quantity, but when you are cleaning hundreds of homes a month you need quality and quantity. There is no better place to get quality household goods in high quantity than Costco,\u201d says Chris Willatt, owner of Alpine Maids.\n\nGetty Images / MANDEL NGAN\n\nWhy It's A Great Place To Shop\n\nNot only is Costco a great place to buy in bulk, but the prices are competitive, too. According to Willat they frequently have better deals than the commercial vendors and when cleaning is your job, price really counts. \u201cI would recommend buying everything you can in bulk at Costco,\u201d says Alessandro Gazzo of Emily\u2019s Maids. \u201cAs a professional cleaner, each cent counts because you're buying gallons of cleaning products e.g. white vinegar, liquid soap, bleach, etc.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, Costco is so popular among professional cleaners that when Willatt needs a present for his staff, he knows just what to buy. \u201cThe #1 employee reward that I find myself giving out are Costco memberships,\u201d he says. \u201cOur employees go crazy for them.\u201d\n\nAs anyone who has ever wielded their membership card knows, though, Costco is huge. Knowing whether to pick up a bulk order of paper towels or a giant jug of Windex amid all the many, many options lining the store\u2019s giant shelves can be overwhelming. To help navigate the aisles, we reached out to the pros to find out what they buy with their memberships.\n\nHere\u2019s what professional cleaners buy when they are perusing the aisles of Costco:\n\n\n\nScotch Brite Heavy-Duty Scour Pads\n\n\u201cNothing comes in handy more than a scouring pad during a deep cleaning,\" says Willatt.\n\n\n\nDish Soap\n\n\"It's hard to save money on a good degreaser, but Kirkland Signature Ultra Shine Liquid Dish Soap is excellent for cleaning almost everything,\u201d says Ryan Knoll from Tidy Casa. \u201cDishes, sure, but also showers, sinks, and countertops. It's great and super affordable.\u201d\n\nMemphis Maids\u2019 Evans agrees: \u201cConcentrated dish soap is pretty cheap at Costco. You can get a 102 oz Palmolive bottle for $10.99, or the Kirkland soap for $9.49. They\u2019re not as good as Dawn, but they do the job, especially if you\u2019re going to combine them with other cleaners.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nBaking Soda\n\n\u201cYou can find a 13.5 lb baking soda bag for $9.99. That's a great price but again, it's a 13.5 lb bag, so keep in mind you might have to split it between family members or use it very frequently,\u201d says Gazzo of Emily\u2019s Maids.\n\nShark Navigator Lift-Away Upright Vacuum with Self-Cleaning Brushroll\n\n\u201c[This] is my go-to vacuum,\u201d says Knoll of Tidy Casa. \u201cIt's usually about $400, and Costco sells it for $189.99. Plus, with their warranty, you can get a new one when it breaks. It's super important when you use it every day.\u201d\n\nSponges\n\n\u201cDisposable sponges are great for bathrooms,\u201d says Steve Evans of Memphis Maids. \u201cThey have both non-scratch and heavy-duty sponges and they\u2019re pretty cheap in my opinion.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrash Bags\n\n\"Costco sells good quality [Kirkland] trash bags at $0.10 per bag. It's not just about savings as much as it is value. These are good quality trash bags like the ones you'd buy at the grocery store. Our alternative at that price point is to buy bags at $0.07 per bag, but they are the ultra thin clear liners that you might find in a commercial setting like an office building or lining a hotel bathroom bin. We could use these liners to cut costs, but we'd be leaving our clients frustrated when they go to empty the trash and the cheap bags rip open in their kitchen,\u201d says Willatt. \u201cIf you find yourself at Costco, I'd stock up on trash bags.\u201d\n\nO-Cedar EasyWring Spin Mop & Bucket System\n\n\u201c[This] is a super convenient mop,\u201d says Knoll. \u201cIt's lightweight, inexpensive (especially at Costco), and does a great job, especially when other mops might cost $150-$200 to do the same job.\"\n\nLaundry Soap\n\n\u201cI like the Ecos soap laundry soap. This is great because many people are sensitive to scents in their laundry because, unlike other cleaners, you are wearing your clothes and having that scent near you all the time,\u201d says Evans of Memphis Maids. \u201cA 2-pack of a 210-load bottle for $39 easily lasts for a very long time even if you have a large family or if you are a professional cleaner and you bring your own cleaning supplies to do laundry.\u201d\n\nThe Unscented Company Dish Soap\n\n\u201cProducts from The Unscented Company are fantastic if you're looking for eco-friendly, unscented products,\u201d says Gazzo. \u201cFor example, they have a 10-liter dish soap refill for $50 which I think is decently (good-quality, eco-friendly products are always a bit more expensive than more commercial products). Or, a box of 300 laundry tabs for $75 which can easily last for a year and a half. If this is only for personal use, I would recommend splitting the bill and the box with two to three family members.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "You couldn't have gone wrong buying shares of Amazon (AMZN -2.51%) or Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) in the two companies' early days. A $10,000 investment in Costco when the giant wholesaler went public in 1985 would be worth almost $11.9 million today. If you had bought $10,000 of Amazon's shares after its IPO in 1997 and held them, you'd now have nearly $23.4 million.\n\nBoth Amazon and Costco have delivered exceptional gains over the last 12 months, too. But which is the better stock to buy and hold forever?\n\nTwo great businesses\n\nThe primary reason behind the tremendous stock performances of Amazon and Costco is that both companies have great underlying businesses. However, they're very different from each other.\n\nAmazon is best known for its industry-leading online shopping platform. Its distribution and logistics operations that support this platform, though, are arguably the real secret to the company's e-commerce success. Thanks largely to these operations, Amazon has ranked as the lowest-priced U.S. retailer by Profitero for eight consecutive years.\n\nNo company has been better at identifying new growth opportunities over the years than Amazon, in my opinion. It kicked off the cloud services market with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Last year, AWS generated $107.6 billion in revenue and operating income of $39.8 billion.\n\nCostco didn't invent the warehouse wholesale market. That honor belongs to Sol Price's Price Club. However, Costco perfected the business model. The company opened its first warehouse in 1983. In less than six years, its sales skyrocketed from $0 to $3 billion -- the first company to achieve such rapid growth. Costco also subsequently merged with Price Club in 1993.\n\nToday, Costco operates 897 warehouses in 14 countries. It also has a significant e-commerce business. The company has 77.4 million paid members and counting. And they're loyal customers: Costco's worldwide membership renewal rate is 90.4%.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAmazon's greatest growth opportunity is in cloud services. Currently, around 90% of global IT spending remains on-premises, with roughly 10% of spending in the cloud. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes this dynamic will flip over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWith the surging deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the cloud, Jassy's view seems realistic. As the biggest cloud services provider, AWS should be a huge winner from this shift.\n\nJassy has a similar take on e-commerce. Physical stores still make up between 80% and 85% of the global retail market. Over the next 10 to 20 years, Jassy predicts that the equation will flip, with e-commerce dominating the retail market. Again, Amazon is poised to be a major beneficiary if Jassy is right.\n\nAs it has in the past, Amazon is also expanding into new arenas. Advertising should become an even more important growth driver for the company in the coming years on its e-commerce platform and Prime Video. Amazon's planned launches of its Kuiper satellites to provide internet services is another long-term growth opportunity.\n\nCostco has a clear path to grow as well. Perhaps the most obvious opportunity is international expansion. Most of the company's warehouse locations are in the U.S.\n\nAdding products and services that boost profits at existing and new warehouses is another good way for Costco to grow. For example, the company's Kirkland Signature private-label brands are growing faster than the overall business. Costco also has great expectations for its retail media strategy. It began last year building an ad network using an extensive database of member's buying histories.\n\nE-commerce is another key opportunity for Costco. The company's digital business is growing quickly, with top sales categories including home furnishings, appliances, hardware, and sporting goods.\n\nBetter long-term pick?\n\nI like both of these businesses. However, I think that Amazon is hands-down the better long-term pick.\n\nImportantly, Amazon has more growth opportunities than Costco does. Several of those opportunities, notably including cloud services, are also much larger than Costco's.\n\nInterestingly, though, higher growth expectations are baked into Costco's share price than with Amazon. Costco's shares trade at roughly 58.5 times forward earnings, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on five-year growth projections of 6.36. Amazon has a forward earnings multiple of 35.5 with a PEG ratio of 1.85.\n\nI don't expect Amazon to deliver the same level of growth that it has over the last 20 years. However, this stock should continue to be a winner for investors for a long time to come.",

Not for Pokemon but it was an added perk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a shame on what\u2019s happening within the community here\u2019s hoping SOMETHING will be done to stop this,\u201d wrote another.\n\nA third commenter called the whole thing ridiculous.\n\nCostco members 'panic buying' eggs as shortage spark fears - and cartons were all gone in less than 10 minutes\n\n\u201cThese adult scalpers are ridiculous..I've been a heavy collector for not quite 2 years..I'm getting sick of the hobby getting ruined.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout to say screw it and sell whole collection...Imagine being a young kid and that's all you want & not being able to get any in stores, online or anywhere without paying 3x price or more.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Sun reached out to Costco to confirm if future sets were in fact canceled for good but has yet to hear back.\n\nBLOOMING WATERS\n\nBlooming Waters is a premium collection of the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game which includes booster packs, foil cards, and a code card.\n\nFans look to score all four foil cards featuring Venusaur ex, Blastoise ex, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle.\n\nIt also comes with one oversize foil card featuring Blastoise ex and a code card for Pok\u00e9mon TCG Live.\n\nCostco membership sharing guidelines Costco has strict rules for membership use that shoppers must follow and they've been cracking down on offenders in recent years. Primary Member Use: Only the primary cardholder can use this Costco membership card. Sharing it for purchases is not allowed as the photo on the card must match the person using it.\n\nHousehold Card: Each primary member can add one free household cardholder who lives at the same address. This person will receive their own membership card and can shop at Costco independently\n\nGuest Policy: Members can bring up to two guests per visit to Costco. However, only the member can make purchases. Guests must be accompanied by the member.\n\nAuthorized Cardholder: For an additional fee, you can add an authorized cardholder, such as a family member or friend, who doesn't reside at your address. They will receive their own card and can shop independently.\n\nCredit: Costco\n\nLIMITED ITEMS\n\nChicken farms are currently being devastated by a new strain of the Avian flu - which has led to egg shortages and higher prices.\n\nCostco has also added limits to purchasing eggs to keep members from over buying after the dreaded egg shortage.\n\nShoppers have also reported that BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club is limiting customers to a maximum of two crates.\n\nAlso, Kroger has been the latest to limit, as shoppers have seen some banner divisions placing limits on egg purchases.",

And yet I\u2019m with A.J. and Big Justice. My father and I are devoted Costco Guys.\n\nThe wholesaler has everything. You can go intending to pick up some caramel pecan popcorn and come back with a four-poster bed. Costco is also cheap, though fortune favors the brave: heart-stopping bulk deals will appear and then disappear without warning.\n\nWhen cut-price Mutti tinned tomatoes materialized, I urgently instructed my father to buy a trolley load. He refused, insisting we didn\u2019t have space for fifty cans at home. The next time we went shopping, the Mutti was gone. I was angry at him for days.\n\nWhy else do I prefer the vast warehouses of Costco to a regular supermarket? Well, they accept returns on basically anything. They also have an excellent optician on site. At checkout, they\u2019ll scan your heavy goods without making you unload them from the trolley.\n\nThen there are the exciting pneumatic tubes that whizz bundles of banknotes around the building whenever the cashiers empty their tills. As a kid I would crane my neck heavenward, dreaming that one day a bundle would take a wrong turn and $50 notes would rain down upon us. I still do, actually. The Costco food court is alarmingly unhealthy but strangely joyful. When I last visited my local branch, a boy and his granny were together devouring a colossal 18-inch pepperoni pizza ($9.95). There was a young couple on a date, feeding each other Italian gelato.\n\nPeople queued for the famous \u201c1\u20444 pound plus ALL BEEF HOT DOG\u201d which comes with a 22oz fizzy drink (unlimited refills). That hot dog, which is topped with caramelized onions, ketchup and mustard, is $1.50. The price hasn\u2019t changed since 1985.\n\nA distinguished-looking retired man told me his daily routine consists of a gym and spa session across the road (courtesy of life membership bought on the cheap decades ago), followed by baked potato with beans and cheese at Costco. \u201cIt fuels me for the whole day,\u201d he said cheerily. \u201cMy wife hasn\u2019t needed to cook for me for twenty years.\u201d His daily outgoings must be less than the average person spends on a coffee.\n\nCostco is \u201cmembers only,\u201d which gives it both an air of exclusivity and helps instill loyalty. Membership costs just $65 a year. My father and I failed to make the cut for Soho House membership, so it\u2019s gratifying to know that, in Costco, there\u2019s a club that\u2019s happy to have us.\n\nThis article was originally published in The Spectator\u2019s March 2025 World edition.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA real estate agent in Omaha, Nebraska, recently got an unexpected houseguest \u2013 a hungry opossum who ate the entire tuxedo chocolate mousse cake she recently bought from Costco.\n\nKim Doggett walked outside last Sunday to find her chocolate cake on the floor of her back porch, brown paw prints on her new beige couch and a panting opossum lying on top of it.\n\nNow fans have flooded Nebraska Wildlife Rehab, where the opossum was admitted on February 10, with messages of support for the viral \u201cCake Bandit\u201d who ate an entire Costco cake.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, girl,\u201d one person said under the wildlife rescue service\u2019s Facebook post.\n\n\u201cI have also begun to (breathe) heavily after eating an entire cake by myself. Maybe not Costco but it definitely has happened more than once. I get it gurl. I get it,\u201d another commenter said.\n\nThe \"Cake Bandit\" is being treated at Nebraska Wildlife Rehab. Courtesy Nebraska Wildlife Rehab\n\nEarlier that night, Doggett asked her son to take her homemade peanut butter balls outside to the deck, as their refrigerator was full.\n\n\u201cWe just (ran) out of room,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cAnd in the wintertime, it works out great, because you don\u2019t have to try to slam everything in there. You can set it out on the back deck.\u201d\n\nUpon opening the door, her son quickly shut it and refused to go back out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a possum on your couch,\u201d Hayden Doggett, 22, said to her.\n\nHis mom didn\u2019t believe him at first.\n\n\u201cI really thought he was messing with me, so I went over and I turned the light on, I opened the door, and I was like, \u2018Oh my,\u2019\u201d Kim Doggett said. \u201cAnd then I was like, \u2018Oh, it ate the Costco cake.\u2019 The whole thing almost was sitting on the ground next to the couch.\u201d\n\nThe two tried to shoo the opossum away, but with no luck, she began to consider whether the chocolate could have been poisonous to the animal. Kim Doggett then called the American Humane Society, which retrieved and transported the animal to be evaluated.\n\nEating the entire cake likely saved the opossum\u2019s life, Nebraska Wildlife Rehab said. The \u201cCake Bandit\u201d is currently being treated for both her recent dietary habits and unrelated lead toxicity.\n\n\u201cIt appears that she was lucky to have been caught red-handed, because it allowed her to come to our hospital and get diagnosed with what can become a fatal condition in wildlife,\u201d Laura Stastny, the group\u2019s executive director, said in an email to CNN.\n\nNebraska Wildlife Rehab created shirts with the opossum's face. Courtesy Nebraska Wildlife Rehab\n\nSince her admittance, the organization has designed T-shirts with \u201cCake Bandit\u201d on the front, and the back displaying the animal\u2019s rehab admission note: \u201cOpossum was brought in due to having eaten an entire Costco chocolate cake. He was panting a lot, however mobile and alert.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d celebrate the sweetest scandal of the week with a custom-designed Opossum Cake Bandit t-shirt that also supports our mission to save native wildlife and contribute to more success stories like hers,\u201d Nebraska Wildlife Rehab said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe opossum is expected to make a full recovery and will be returned to her natural habitat in a few weeks, Stastny said.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about her future release, but it will likely be toward the end of March or the beginning of April before she is released into the wild,\u201d she added.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \"there's still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\" He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper's comments about the market were precarious and didn't reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \"I mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation's precarious on Squawk Box. And it's not.\"\n\nInstead, Cramer shared \"These are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let's make a talk. Let's do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it's not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President's strategy, I think people say, is working.\" As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \"And the answer is why you would sell is because you don't believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn't exist. I come back and say, well I don't know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\"\n\nThe CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \"how can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they're getting that in spade,\" on the other hand he agreed that \"Yes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we're gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer was surprised by the President's China approach. He had \"expected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\"",

            "content": "I have been a dedicated Costco shopper for decades. I shop there so often that an employee finally pulled me aside several years ago and told me I needed to upgrade to an executive membership. If they sold kale, I could probably do all of my shopping there, but alas, my husband needs his dark, leafy greens.\n\nBut there are certain ingredients that I almost always buy at Costco. Not only are they high quality, but they also have a reasonable price tag. Some things may be slightly more expensive or the same price as other grocers, but sometimes that extra cost is worth it, so I know I won't run out for a while. From pantry staples like oils and nuts to frozen items that help me avoid expensive takeout on busy weeknights, my fridge, freezers and cupboards are bursting with Costco products. Here are my favorites.\n\n1. Oils\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nHigh-quality oils can carry a hefty price tag. That's why I purchase large bottles of avocado and extra-virgin olive oil from Costco. I decant them into smaller, prettier bottles and keep them on my counter so we're not left staring at giant plastic bottles (those I tuck in my pantry so they stay fresh). I tend to buy the 2-liter bottles, and last time I shopped, they clocked in at $21.99 for avocado and $26.39 for extra-virgin olive oils\u2014both of which were about half the price that I would've spent on the same amount at another grocery store.\n\n2. Nuts\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nWe go through a lot of nuts in my house. My husband adds walnuts, almonds and pecans to his oatmeal and chia pudding, plus we snack on pistachios, cashews and mixed nuts. I always get them at Costco because we go through so many, plus they're a crazy good deal. A 3-pound bag of walnuts is about $12, and 2 1/2 pounds of mixed nuts is about $15. You really can't beat those prices. I portion them into large canning jars and freeze what we won't eat in a week or so to ensure that they stay fresh.\n\n3. Frozen Pot Stickers\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nMy family adores pot stickers and dumplings. And they're a great quick meal. A few years ago I started freezing leftover rice in a resealable bag, adding to it whenever I had any left from dinner. Now I use that to make fried rice to serve with pot stickers\u2014we eat this meal at least twice a month. I've bought almost every brand Costco sells, but I prefer Bibigo or Ling Ling as they both come with sauce packets. Soups and stir-fries made with pot stickers are also delicious. My daughter has even been known to make them for breakfast, and I've cooked some and popped them in a Thermos for her lunch as well.\n\n4. Rao's Marinara Sauce\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nSorry Bove's, I love your meatballs but Rao's marinara can't be beat. (It was even a top pick in our marinara sauce taste test!) Nor can its price at Costco be beat! If it's a Costco trip kind of weekend, I typically go there first and then to the regular grocery store, just in case they're out of anything I can't wait to get on my next trip. The last time I went, I forgot to get my jars of Rao's and had a bit of sticker shock at the grocery store. At Costco, a 2-pack of 28-ounce jars is about $12\u2014a single 24-ounce jar is more than $8 at my local grocery store.\n\n5. Cheese\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nWe looooooove cheese at our house and go through a lot of it. Plus, most cheeses stay good for a while, so I don't have to worry about them going bad if I buy them in larger quantities at Costco. And despite what you may have heard, cheese is super nutritious and boasts some impressive health benefits. I always get Cheddar cheese (Cabot Seriously Sharp is our favorite), tubs of Kirkland Feta and Parmigiano-Reggiano. If we're having pizza night, I'll grab fresh mozzarella as well. And if we're entertaining, I'll grab some more specialty cheeses. They have great artisan cheese options, including Humboldt Fog and cheese from Vermont Creamery and Jasper Hill Farm.\n\n6. Organic Berries\n\nCourtesy of Brand\n\nNo matter what the season, the prices of organic berries at Costco are almost always a better deal than at the grocery store. They almost always have organic blueberries and raspberries, but sometimes strawberries and blackberries too.\n\n7. Frozen Fruit & Veggies\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nIf you have the freezer space and make a lot of smoothies, it's hard to beat the price of Costco's frozen fruit. They have a really big selection, which is nice if you like variety. And frozen fruits and vegetables can be healthier than fresh since they are frozen at peak ripeness. We've even taken to snacking on frozen cherries and mango chunks (the latter was a favorite dessert of mine when I was pregnant). I also buy frozen mixed vegetables and broccoli. Almost all of Costco's frozen produce is organic, too, if that matters to you.\n\n8. Frozen Fish\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nI discovered that I eat more fish when I have it in my freezer. And the quality of frozen fish is so good\u2014much of the \"fresh\" fish you buy at the seafood counter was previously frozen anyway (check the tag next time). I tend to buy wild-caught salmon and cod the most. A couple of my favorite recipes to use them in are Miso-Maple Salmon and Almond-&-Lemon-Crusted Fish with Spinach.\n\n9. Kalamata Olives\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nI'm half Lebanese and make a lot of Middle Eastern-inspired meals, like falafel or mujadara served with a big Greek salad. And one of my daughter's go-to breakfasts is kale, feta and olive tacos. I also frequently pack her what I call \"Lebanese girl snack,\" which includes olives, feta and hummus with cucumbers, carrots and crackers or naan dippers in her bento box. All that to say, we go through a lot of Kalamata olives, so buying this big jar makes sense for us. The brine they're packed in is a delicious swap for vinegar in your salad dressing, too.\n\n10. Chia Seeds\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nBoth my husband and daughter adore chia pudding. I make a couple for each of them on Sunday, and they can jazz it up however they like in the morning when they dig in. I usually add a splash of milk, berries and maple syrup, sometimes a pinch of cocoa powder, too, for Lila. And Dan likes to add more milk, granola or muesli and fruit. Chia seeds have myriad health benefits; namely, they are packed with fiber, protein and omega-3s.\n\n11. Oats\n\nEating Well/Costco\n\nWe go through a lot of oats at our house! My husband makes oatmeal a few times a week, I make batches of muesli when it's warmer outside, and we like to bake oatmeal cookies and oat bread, too.",

With some time in rehab (and a diet reset), this choco-holic should be stabilized enough to return to the wild but until then, she is definitely a little cranky about our strict \u201czero chocolate\u201d policy,\u201d Nebraska Wildlife Rehab posted to Facebook.\n\n4 Nebraska Wildlife Rehab made shirts after the opossum went viral. Nebraska Wildlife Rehab, Inc./Facebook\n\n\u201cSame, opossum\u2026. same.\u201d\n\nThe now-viral post had received thousands of comments from sympathetic observers on social media as of Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been there, girl,\u201d one person said under the wildlife rescue\u2019s Facebook post.\n\nAnother commenter said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, lil dude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to act around chocolate cake either.\u201d",

It can be fatal.\n\nMost outbreaks stem from homemade products, rather than from commercially manufactured ones. Improperly home-canned or fermented food can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. If in doubt about whether home-canned food is safe to eat, you should throw it out rather than taste it, the C.D.C. says.\n\nSigns of contamination include containers that are damaged or bulging, and you should throw away preserved food that has a bad odor.

According to Costco's website, a standard 10\" Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Mousse Filling has two layers and contains fudge icing, likely not ideal for a wild animal.\n\n\"We googled chocolate with opossums because I know with dogs it's poisonous and thought this would not be good for this little girl,\" Doggett said.\n\nDoggett's family rushed the wild animal to Nebraska Wildlife Rehab.

GENC.\n\nStory Continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)\n\nShares of Costco have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+48.7% vs. +26.1%). The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\nSAP\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+65.6% vs. +6.4%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance gained from robust cloud demand, especially solid uptake of its Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. Its cloud revenues rose 27% year over year to \u20ac4.71 billion, powered by 35% growth in the Cloud ERP Suite sales.\n\n\n\nCloud backlog was up 40% to \u20ac63 billion at the end of 2024. A strong focus on Business AI and Joule development is poised to boost sales through 2027. The company\u2019s healthy profit and cash flow statements position it for long-term growth.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s revised 2025 outlook succeeds the previous Ambition 2025 strategy. It now expects cloud and software sales in the \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion band, up from the prior view of \u20ac29.83 billion at cc. However, continued softness in the Software license and support business poses a headwind. Rising restructuring costs affect its margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\n\nShares of Gencor have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Thermal Products industry over the past year (-13.9% vs. +39.5%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $201.40 million is facing challenges which include an 8.3% third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue decline due to shipment delays, decreasing gross margins and rising operating expenses.\n\n\n\nWhile Gencor's robust backlog is a positive indicator, over-reliance could expose the company to risks if order fulfillment delays persist. Additionally, increased reliance on non-operating income and marketable securities introduces volatility, posing risks in uncertain economic conditions.\n\n\n\nGencor\u2019s strong backlog grew 67% to $46.6 million as of Jun 30, 2024, signaling strong demand and future revenue potential despite a recent revenue decline.

            "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nBy now, many companies have learned the hard way that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs aren\u2019t the business panacea they were once sold to be. In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald\u2019s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks. But Costco, against the tide, has doubled down on its DEI initiatives \u2014 at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing.\n\nCostco\u2019s DEI program isn\u2019t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company\u2019s operations at every level, with a Chief Diversity Officer at the helm and employees dedicated solely to diversity goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired.\n\nMoreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting suppliers, and its donations go to controversial activist groups \u2014 some of which have been accused of illegal racial discrimination themselves.\n\nFORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE\n\nIn a bid to halt Costco\u2019s DEI trajectory, a shareholder proposal was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, the financial fallout for Costco could be catastrophic.\n\nIf even a small fraction of Costco\u2019s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn\u2019t retreat; instead, the company\u2019s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn\u2019t just about improving financial outcomes, but about \"enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nDespite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers \u2014 BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street \u2014 were complicit with the board in driving Costco\u2019s DEI push. With significant stakes in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco\u2019s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal\u2019s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer.\n\nCostco\u2019s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies \u2014 such as Costco \u2014 that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\n\nOn top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They argue that Costco\u2019s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action.\n\nCostco\u2019s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace hostility and fail to yield the promised business benefits should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco\u2019s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price.\n\nThe tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn\u2019t pay off.",

The sweet-tart cherry topping is perfectly balanced by the delicate sour cream-meets-whipped cream border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply Recipes/ Costco\n\nCostco\u2019s Kirkland Signature Cherry-Topped Cheesecake Is an Instant Classic\n\nWhile $23 might seem like a high price for cheesecake, this nearly six-pound dessert easily feeds at least 15 and looks so good on a serving plate. Atop Costco\u2019s classic cheesecake is a cherry mixture held in place with a delicate whipped border.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cheesecake layer is pretty standard for Costco\u2019s bakery\u2014rich and not-to-sweet with a thin graham cracker crust that is buttery and somewhat soft. It is truly the cherry topping paired with its sour cream-meets-whipped-cream border that really makes this dessert special.\n\nWhile I am sometimes put off by cherry desserts (they can be cloying or taste artificial), Costco\u2019s cherry topping perfectly captures what I love about the stone fruit. The topping is sweet but a little tart and syrupy without being thick and gloopy. The addition of a little sour cream topping along the cake's edge also beautifully balances the cheesecake layer\u2019s richness, too.\n\nThis cherry cheesecake would be ideal for a party\u2014think Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, graduations, baby showers\u2014but it could also be easily frozen to become a treat for smaller families like mine. We happily devoured slices for dessert one evening, then I cut the cake into eight more slices and froze them on a parchment-lined sheet tray before moving the solid pieces to an airtight container for longer storage.\n\nNow I can take out an individual slice of this gorgeous cheesecake any night, let it thaw on a plate for 15 minutes, and have a delicious dessert. Next time I go to Costco for basics, this cherry cheesecake will be on my essentials list.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo learn more about our approach to product recommendations, see HERE.\n\n\n\nRead the original article on SIMPLYRECIPES",

            "content": "Many people love Costco because of its wide variety of products (and the free sample stations you can pick from while you shop!) However, some don't like the retailer's restrictions on payment options.\n\nFor most purchases, Costco only accepts Visa credit cards \u2014 meaning you can't use a Mastercard or Amex to pay. An exception to this rule is Costco.com purchases, which allow for Mastercard to be used.\n\nLet's review which Visa cards are the most rewarding ones to use the next time you check out at Costco.\n\nCostco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi\n\nAnnual fee: $0 (with paid Costco membership)\n\nWelcome bonus: None\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nThe first pick is the most obvious one, the cobranded Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi (see rates and fees). This card earns cash back at the following rates:\n\n5% cash back on gas purchased at Costco warehouse locations worldwide and 4% cash back on other eligible gas and EV charging purchases (on the first $7,000 in combined purchases per year and then 1% cash back thereafter)\n\n3% cash back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases worldwide\n\n2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com\n\n1% cash back on all other purchases\n\nThe sweet spot for this card is gas purchases, although note the cap of $7,000 applies to gas purchases made at both Costco warehouses and other gas vendors.\n\nUnfortunately, the card doesn't offer a welcome bonus, but because it doesn't charge an annual fee (with a paid Costco membership), you can rack up cash rewards with no out-of-pocket cost.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe cash back earned on the card is redeemed once a year as a reward certificate that comes after your February billing statement closes. Once you have the reward certificate, you can redeem it for merchandise or cash.\n\nRead our full review of the Costco Anywhere Visa Card\n\nApply here: Costo Anywhere Visa Card\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn an additional 1.5% cash back on everything purchased (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year) \u2013 worth up to $300 cash back.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nSince most cards don't offer bonus categories specific to warehouse clubs like Costco, your best bet is often to use a card that offers a strong return on everyday spending. Among all the Visa cards, none is better in this category than the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae. This no-annual-fee card offers 1.5% cash back on purchases with no cap.\n\nIf you also hold a premium Ultimate Rewards-earning card such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae or the Ink Business Preferred\u00ae Credit Card, you can redeem cash back rewards as Ultimate Rewards points, effectively increasing your return on all purchases from 1.5% to 3%.\n\nThis could definitely be worth considering, especially if you're interested in redeeming for awards rather than only receiving straight cash back. With this card (provided you also have another Ultimate Rewards-earning card in your wallet), you have the option to transfer rewards to a variety of travel partners.\n\nRead our full review of the Chase Freedom Unlimited\n\nApply here: Chase Freedom Unlimited\n\nChase Freedom\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nWelcome bonus: None\n\nAlthough this card is no longer open to new applicants, it's sometimes confused with the Freedom Unlimited or Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae. Where the Chase Freedom\u00ae differs from other cards in the same family is its earning structure \u2014 otherwise, it has the same welcome bonus, redemption options and no annual fee.\n\nWith the Chase Freedom, you'll earn 5% back on your first $1,500 spent on rotating quarterly bonus categories (activation required), and 1% on all other purchases. Wholesale clubs like Costco normally appear on the bonus calendar at least once a year, giving you the opportunity to earn up to 5% back during this time frame.\n\nThe information for the Chase Freedom has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred Card\n\nAnnual fee: $95\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nDue to its wholesale prices, Costco is a go-to for many shoppers looking to buy big-ticket items such as TVs and jewelry. If you plan to make a large purchase at this retailer, you might want to consider using this card due to its purchase protection policy.\n\nWith the Chase Sapphire Preferred, you're covered for theft, damage or \"involuntary and accidental parting\" on eligible items for up to 120 days after you made the purchase (charging it to this card, of course). The policy will replace, repair or reimburse you for up to $500 per claim, with a maximum of $50,000 per account.\n\nEven if you don't need this coverage, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card could be worth using on Costco purchases since it earns valuable Ultimate Rewards points. However, you'll only get 1 point per dollar spent at this retailer.\n\nRead our full review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred\n\nApply here: Chase Sapphire Preferred\n\nAlaska Airlines Visa Signature credit card\n\nAnnual fee: $95\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn 70,000 bonus miles plus Alaska's Famous Companion Fare\u2122 ($99 fare plus taxes and fees from $23) after making $3,000 or more in purchases within the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nThis pick may be surprising to some, since it doesn't offer any bonuses on spending at Costco. Still, the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature\u00ae credit card earns solid rates in specific categories including:\n\nUnlimited 3 miles per dollar spent on eligible Alaska Airlines purchases\n\nUnlimited 2 miles per dollar spent on eligible gas, EV charging station, cable, streaming and local transit purchases\n\nUnlimited 1 mile per dollar spent on all other purchases\n\nAccording to TPG's February 2025 valuation, TPG values these miles at 1.45 cents apiece.\n\nFurther Reading: Maximizing redemptions with Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan\n\nFrom free stopovers on one-way awards to competitive premium cabin flights on Cathay Pacific and Starlux, Mileage Plan is an incredibly valuable program, and shopping at Costco can help you rack up miles quickly.\n\nRead our full review of the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card.\n\nApply here: Alaska Airlines Visa Signature\n\nCiti Double Cash Card\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn $200 in cash back after spending $1,500 on purchases in the first six months of account opening.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nThe Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card (see rates and fees) has a straightforward earning structure. Cardholders earn a total of 2% cash back on purchases: 1% when you buy and 1% as you pay for your purchases. There are no bonus categories to worry about or caps on how much cash back you can earn.\n\nKeep in mind that the Double Cash card is a Mastercard and, therefore, will only work when used for purchases at Costco.com. Cash back is earned in the form of Citi ThankYou points, so if you also hold a Citi card that has transfer partners such as the Citi Strata Premier\u2120 Card (see rates and fees), earning 2% cash back can be a great way to rack up rewards toward travel.\n\nRead our full review of the Citi Double Cash review.\n\nApply here: Citi Double Cash\n\nCapital One Spark Miles for Business\n\nAnnual fee: $0 introductory annual fee the first year, then $95 after.\n\nWelcome bonus: Earn 50,000 bonus miles after spending $4,500 on purchases within the first 3 months of account opening.\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nFor business owners, the Capital One Spark Miles for Business is a great option for Costco.com purchases. The card earns 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases plus 5 miles per dollar spent on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. For business owners who often shop at Costco, opt for online shopping as this card is a Mastercard and can help you rack up your Capital One Miles.\n\nThe card also offers employee cards at no additional cost, so you maximize your earning power via employee spending as well. Best of all, miles earned can be transferred to Capital One's 15-plus transfer partners.\n\nRead our full review of the Capital One Spark Miles for Business review.\n\nLearn more: Capital One Spark Miles for Business\n\nBottom line\n\nPicking the right card to use at Costco can be a challenge, between the general lack of bonus categories and the Visa-only policy \u2014 with the exception of Costco.com allowing for Mastercard. Still, you can maximize your Costco spending by using the right card to earn cash back, points or miles each time you check out.\n\nRelated: The best credit cards for online shopping",

Last year, the brand launched a Kit Kat that tastes like pink lemonade, a Halloween version covered in cinnamon toast-flavored creme, and its first-ever holiday shape.\n\nNow, Kit Kat has quietly added a nostalgic new flavor to the lineup but it\u2019s only available at Costco.\n\nKit Kat\u2019s New Cotton Candy Flavor\n\nCostco shoppers have a sharp eye when it comes to new products. From the food court to the bakery, nothing gets by the store\u2019s most devoted customers. Recently, Costco insider @costcoaisles spotted a vibrant new Kit Kat flavor on shelves. The video shows a 100-count variety bag that includes individually wrapped milk chocolate, vanilla, and cotton candy-flavored Kit Kats.\n\n\n\nFood reviewer @markie_devo also shared the news on their Instagram and commenters had mixed reactions. \u201cYuck. I hate cotton candy flavor so much, just sugar-flavored sugar,\u201d wrote one person. \u201cNo one asked for this flavor,\u201d replied another.\n\nDespite the critics, many are curious to try the new baby blue-hued candy. \u201cI need the cotton candy Kit Kat,\u201d said one fan. \u201cCan someone with a Costco membership send these my way?\u201d pleaded another.\n\nOne sentiment echoed across social media channels is disappointment that the new flavor isn\u2019t more widely available. \u201cExclusive will kill the sales, why not just bring flavors out everywhere,\u201d questioned one Instagrammer. \u201cUGH! Costco exclusive?! Also why not just a bag of all cotton candy Kit Kats? I wanna [try] these,\u201d replied another frustrated shopper.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long the cotton candy-flavored Kit Kats will be available, or what the official plans are for a larger rollout. But hopefully, some eagle-eyed fans will see them pop up at additional retailers soon.",

She was also found to have a high level of lead, likely from eating local insects.\n\nThe opossum is now being treated for the lead in her system and will be released in a few weeks, rehab officials said.\n\n\"With some time in rehab (and a diet reset), this choco-holic should be stabilized enough to return to the wild but until then, she is definitely a little cranky about our strict 'zero chocolate' policy,\" the rehab said on social media.",

He was promoted to Vice President of Operations in the San Diego Region in 1999, before moving to Washington state in 2010 and being promoted to Senior Vice President of the Northwest Region.\n\nIn August 2015, Jeff Brotman, who started Costco Wholesale with Jim Sinegal, asked Vachris to become the vice president of real estate development, giving him experience in working on international and domestic new markets and expansion. Shortly after, then-CEO Craig Jelinek asked Vachris to oversee buying for Costco and he became the Executive Vice President of merchandising in July 2016. In February 2022, Costco\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Vachris to the position of President and COO and elected him to the board.\n\nLearn more about this event and the Albers Executive Speaker Series.",

Valued at $469.8 billion by market cap, the company offers a diverse range of branded and private-label products, including groceries, electronics, appliances, and automotive supplies, along with pharmacies, optical centers, fuel stations, and travel services.\n\nShares of this discount stores giant have outperformed the broader market over the past year. COST has gained 46.3% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 20.7%. In 2025, COST stock is up 15.5%, surpassing SPX\u2019s 3.2% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, COST\u2019s outperformance is also apparent compared to VanEck Retail ETF (RTH). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 20.8% over the past year. Moreover, COST\u2019s double-digit returns on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 7.2% gains over the same time frame.\n\nCOST's strong performance is fueled by its membership-driven model, efficient supply chain, bulk purchasing power, and membership fees, ensuring competitive pricing and steady revenue growth. With membership renewal rates surpassing 90% in key markets like the U.S. and Canada, the company benefits from strong customer loyalty and retention. Costco's disciplined approach to cost control and margin improvement, along with growing digital commerce initiatives, enhances profitability. Moreover, plans for new openings domestically and internationally position Costco for continued growth in the retail landscape.\n\nOn Dec. 12, COST shares closed down marginally after reporting its Q1 results. Its EPS of $4.04 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $3.80. The company\u2019s revenue stood at $62.2 billion, up 7.5% year over year.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in August, analysts expect COST\u2019s EPS to grow 11.9% to $18.03 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last three quarters.\n\nAmong the 33 analysts covering COST stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 18 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, three \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and 12 \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThe configuration has been consistent over the past three months.\n\nOn Feb. 7, Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on COST with a price target of $1070, implying a potential upside of 1.1% from current levels.\n\nWhile COST currently trades above its mean price target of $1056.97, the Street-high price target of $1195 suggests an upside potential of 12.9%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

We\u2019ve seen the massive \"Goliath\" barn and the stylish \"studio shed\" take off with shoppers, showing that everyone on the internet can't get enough of these tiny home starter kits. (And honestly, neither can we.) After all, all of the sheds include free shipping and installation, so you can focus on customizing it to your needs and aesthetics. Below, we break down the differences between three of Costco\u2019s massive sheds: Goliath, Maximus, and Titan. Scroll on to see the best fit for your storage needs, whether you\u2019re a dedicated DIY-er who needs the extra storage space or want to build your (always visiting) in-laws their dream guest suite.\n\nRelated Story 10 Underrated Costco Home Items You Should Buy\n\nMaximus Shed\n\nDimensions: 12 feet and 10 inches tall, 16 to 32 feet wide, 16 feet deep\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to sacrifice space but want to keep your shed from being an eyesore in your backyard, go with the elegant ranch aesthetic of the Maximus. The structure looks more like a traditional residential home, so the shed is the perfect start to your ADU journey. Operable windows both flank the double wide doors and bring light in through the side of the shed, so your space doesn\u2019t have to be stuffy and dark inside. An optional vented skylight and wood ramp can be customized, turning this into the perfect guest suite (or Airbnb side hustle).\n\nTitan Shed\n\nDimensions: 12 feet and 10 inches tall, 16 feet wide, 16 to 32 feet deep\n\nIf your shed is more for utility and organization, the Titan is the right fit for you. Make that dream of clearing the garage a reality without paying a monthly storage unit fee. The main doors of the shed are underneath the gable side of the roof, creating a garage-style look for anyone looking to store their backyard tools. Avid gardeners and DIYers alike can really benefit from the extra storage space. Store even the most extended garden tools on the eight-foot-tall sidewalls so they don\u2019t become trip hazards on the floor of your garage.\n\nRelated Story Retreat Inside Costco's New Sprawling\n\nGoliath Shed\n\nDimensions: 19 feet tall, 16 feet wide, 16 to 32 feet deep\n\nThe viral Goliath is definitely the most expensive shed on our list, but for good reason. Unlike the Maximus and Titan sheds, which are both one-story structures, the Goliath has a whopping two stories of room, standing 19 feet tall. The barn-style shed comes with stairs leading to the windowed second story.

            "content": "Costco isn\u2019t backing down from pressure to change its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nAt Costco\u2019s annual meeting, the company\u2019s board of directors unanimously voted down a shareholder proposal from a conservative think tank that argued its diversity initiatives are \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and called for the company to evaluate its DEI policies.\n\n\u201cDEI holds litigation, reputation and financial risks to the Company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders,\u201d read the proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research.\n\nBut the board said it believes its practices are \u201clegally appropriate.\u201d Costco\u2019s board explained that having a diverse set of employees enhances the satisfaction of its members, who come \u201cfrom all walks of life and backgrounds.\u201d A diverse group helps the company select original products and shares insights into customers\u2019 tastes and preferences.\n\nCostco\u2019s board also touted the benefits of having a diverse supplier base, which \u201cfosters creativity and innovation.\u201d\n\nTHE NCPPR is planning to submit another anti-DEI proposal, this time at Apple\u2019s annual shareholder meeting later this month. Apple\u2019s board of directors is recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal.\n\nCostco\u2019s and Apple\u2019s responses are a stark contrast to the rollback in diversity initiatives happening at other major companies.\n\nGoogle recently said it will no longer maintain its hiring targets for underrepresented groups, while its parent company Alphabet has removed diversity-related language from its annual report.\n\nTarget will end DEI goals that were aimed at increasing Black representation among its ranks and promoting Black-owned businesses. Other big companies like Amazon, Toyota and Walmart have also scaled back DEI-related policies.\n\nFollowing the George Floyd protests in 2020, many companies vowed to implement hiring targets, support minority-owned businesses and provide financial support to organizations that champion diversity. But conservative groups have threatened legal action against DEI initiatives after the Supreme Court ended race-based admissions at colleges and universities. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order that ends DEI initiatives within the federal government.\n\nIn spite of these highly publicized efforts to threaten companies based on DEI policies, legal experts told us that not only should private companies be protected from legal action, but some companies\u2019 DEI policies weren\u2019t even that robust to begin with.\n\nCostco\u2019s opponents are trying to argue that the company is an example of \u201cwoke progressivism gone amuck,\u201d but the company is doubling down because its policies are helping the company from a business standpoint, said Stacy Hawkins, a professor at Rutgers Law School.\n\n\u201cCostco says this is not about wokeness \u2014 this is about business strategy and sound decision making based on market analysis and business performance indicators,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nThe company\u2019s policies are also not illegal, said Carliss Chatman, an associate professor at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Dedman School of Law.\n\nCorporate decisions are protected by what\u2019s known as the \u201cbusiness judgment rule,\u201d Chatman said. This means that the director of a corporation is immune from liability if they made decisions in good faith, acted as a \u201creasonably prudent person\u201d would, and they acted in the company\u2019s best interests upon reasonable belief.\n\nBasically, the burden of proof to show that a company acted inappropriately is \u201cvery, very high,\u201d Chatman said.\n\nMost company charters also have exculpation clauses, which means even if a company\u2019s share price goes down, that is not enough for shareholders to prove the corporation\u2019s director breached their fiduciary duty, Chatman said.\n\n\u201cThe principle in American business law is we want people to use the corporate forum to be innovative, take risks, grow our economy and try to do things that will advance and make us the best in the world. You can\u2019t do that if people are so stressed out and concerned about liability,\u201d Chatman said.\n\nLawsuits against DEI initiatives actually get dismissed often because many companies aren\u2019t hiring a diverse-enough workplace, Chatman said.\n\nThe company would have needed to turn down someone who\u2019s white without merit, she said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy for corporations to make the announcement that they\u2019re pulling back their DEI program,\u201d Chatman said. \u201cThe DEI program didn\u2019t really exist in the first place. It was always a marketing ploy.\u201d\n\nOne way a company like Costco could land in legal trouble is if it explicitly excluded hires of a certain race or gender, or someone with a disability, without merit, Chatman said.\n\nOr if the company, say, refused to buy any of its eggs from white-owned farms, she added.\n\nSome people conflate the concept of DEI with affirmative action. But affirmative action, while a subset of DEI, generally entails setting specific numerical targets on who to hire, and takes a candidate\u2019s protected status into consideration, said Lawrence Schaefer, president and owner of the employment law firm Schaefer Halleen.\n\n\u201cAffirmative action is rooted in the recognition that many protected classes have historically been discriminated against,\u201d Schaefer said.\n\nIf a private employer set numerical targets, there\u2019s a good chance the Supreme Court would use its ruling on college admissions to strike that down, Schaefer said.\n\nBut DEI is much more broad and involves doing outreach into minority communities, training and supporting minority candidates to ensure they\u2019re fully supported in their job, and educating the workforce on how to be culturally sensitive, Schaefer explained.\n\nThat\u2019s why Apple and Costco are prepared to continue with their current policies, Schaefer said.\n\nAnother misunderstanding about DEI programs? You may be a beneficiary and not even realize it.\n\n\u201cDEI includes disabilities. It includes veteran status, it includes race, it includes gender,\u201d Chatman said. \u201cThere are DEI programs that are for first-generation college students. I think the problem is it\u2019s been misbranded. DEI is just a dog whistle for Black.\u201d",

We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n\nClostridium botulinum is a bacteria that causes Botulism, a rare but serious illness that attacks the body's nerves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC, the bacteria can produce the toxin within foods, wounds and the intestines of infants, leading to difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and even death.\n\n\"The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick,\" the CDC said. \"These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.\"\n\nThe spores typically do not cause people to become sick, the CDC said. But under certain conditions, the spores can grow, creating \"one of the most lethal toxins known.\"\n\nThe spores can become toxic in a number of environments, including low or no oxygen, low acid, low sugar or low salt, within a certain temperature range with a certain amount of water.\n\n\"For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin,\" the CDC said. \"When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly.\"\n\nThere are five kinds of botulism, the CDC said: Foodborne, Wound, Infant, Iatrogenic and Adult intestinal, the CDC said, all of which are medical emergencies.",

Fill out the form below to begin building a Costco Workers Rank-and-File Committee.\n\nA Costco warehouse in Homestead, Pa. Jan. 31, 2018 [AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar]\n\nOn February 1, the Teamsters announced a tentative agreement in the dead of night and called off a planned strike by 18,000 Costco workers who had voted overwhelmingly for strike action.\n\nFour days later, the union released a letter to members with some of the details. As of this writing, the letter cannot be found anywhere on the Teamsters\u2019 official sites and has not been made public through the media.\n\nThe secrecy reflects the union leadership\u2019s deliberate attempt to keep workers in the dark, preventing widespread discussion and scrutiny of the sellout contract. Workers have only been able to access snippets of the letter through worker-run blogs and social media, highlighting the union\u2019s underhanded tactics to try and force a \u201cyes\u201d vote.\n\nThe tentative agreement the union is now ramming down workers\u2019 throats is nothing short of an insult. The wage increases amount to a pittance:\n\nA $1 raise at the top rate over each of the next three years.\n\nA $0.50 raise at the bottom rate over each of the next three years.\n\nA paltry pension increase of $0.45 per hour, bringing total contributions to $2.56 per hour.\n\nHigher pay increases go to select specialized layers and supervisors, including a $3 per hour premium for pharmacy technicians and a $2 per hour premium for supervisors.\n\nGeorge, a Costco worker in the Los Angeles area who spoke to the World Socialist Web Site, shared his disappointment about Teamsters: \u201cIt feels like a betrayal of their membership. Kind of a slap in the face. We pay a very large portion of our paycheck to be a part of this union to have the kind of union protections, so to not bargain for something that is at least the slightest bit better than the raises that they\u2019re giving to the rest of the [non-union] warehouses, it feels like an insult. Why are we wasting our dollars on union dues when you can\u2019t even bargain for something that is better than non-union warehouses?\u201d\n\nLetter from Teamsters Local 853 detailing \"highlights\" of the new Costco deal [Photo: Teamsters Local 853]\n\nThis sellout is a pay cut when adjusted for inflation. Workers are being asked to accept a deal that will not allow them to even keep up with rising living costs, while Costco rakes in billions.\n\nSignificantly, the letter brags that the contract includes a \u201cLabor Peace Agreement to make it easier to organize non-union warehouses to build strength in bargaining future contracts.\u201d In plain language, the Teamsters have agreed to a sellout contract in exchange for management to allow them to try to expand their dues base among the 90 percent of Costco workers who are not in unions.\n\nThe previous contract already contained a no-strike clause, but in exchange for making it easier to organize non-union warehouses, the union has pledged to maintain \u201cpeace\u201d\u2014meaning no strikes ever, not even disruptions or protests, no real fight for better conditions.\n\nThis is a complete surrender of workers\u2019 most powerful weapons: the right to strike or protest, won through bitter and bloody struggles.\n\nThe union bureaucracy is not interested in fighting for better wages and conditions; it is only interested in growing its own influence and ensuring a steady stream of membership dues. It is a cynical and corrupt maneuver, trading away the urgent needs of workers for the potential of new recruits\u2014who, once brought into the union, will face the same or worse betrayals.\n\nThis is a textbook example of how the union apparatus operates\u2014not as a representative of workers, but as a tool of management and corporate interests.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the Teamsters have actively sought to keep details of this rotten deal from their own members. Workers have reported that they did not receive any official notification from their own union about the deal.\n\nGeorge condemned the union leadership for its silence: \u201cRemarkable that I hear about this [from the WSWS] first before my own union. The Teamsters have lost all credibility and clearly are nothing more than a bureaucratic entity only willing to act to justify their own existence. If they had any backbone, they would have refused this insulting milquetoast mess of a CBA [collective bargaining agreement] and hit Costco where it hurts the most: the public perception that they are somehow \u2018pro-worker.\u2019 What a complete waste of union dues.\u201d\n\nThe Teamsters officials knows that if workers had a real chance to examine and discuss this contract, they would reject it outright. To pass the contract, it is using the same methods it used to push through a contract at UPS in 2023. Weeks after workers ratified a contract they had been told was an historic \u201cvictory,\u201d management began laying off tens of thousands of workers.\n\nThis sellout by the Teamsters comes at a time when workers are under assault from all sides. From Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrant workers and democratic rights to Costco\u2019s phony \u201cpro-worker\u201d image while imposing a real-terms pay cut, the corporate and political establishment is united in its war on the working class. And standing alongside them is Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien. His nationalist and pro-corporate agenda which makes him a natural ally of the extreme right is shared by the whole bureaucracy.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who has openly courted Trump, has no intention of leading any real struggle against corporate power. His brand of militant posturing is pure theater, designed to make workers believe that the Teamsters are on their side while, in reality, the union functions as an arm of management.\n\nHis anti-immigrant rhetoric pits workers in the U.S. against their brothers and sisters internationally, ensuring that companies like Costco can continue exploiting workers with impunity.\n\nThis betrayal is unfolding in the context of a broader wave of struggles in which workers have repeatedly rejected sellout agreements. In recent months, Oregon healthcare workers, BNSF workers, railroad conductors and maintenance of way workers, USPS carriers, Boeing workers have all overwhelmingly voted down tentative agreements pushed by the unions.\n\nDespite this widespread opposition, the leadership of each of these unions has carefully worked to prevent any real unity between these struggles, ensuring that workers remain divided and unable to fight back in a coordinated fashion.\n\nCostco workers must prepare to overwhelmingly reject this sellout contract. But that is only the first step. The Teamsters leadership has demonstrated beyond any doubt that it will not fight for workers\u2019 interests. The rank and file must take matters into their own hands by forming independent committees that are truly controlled by workers\u2014not the union bureaucrats.\n\nThese rank-and-file committees must:\n\nOrganize to defeat the tentative agreement and prepare for a real fight against Costco\u2019s exploitative policies. Take full control of all negotiations and agreements. Reach out to other workers\u2014both unionized and non-union\u2014to build a broader movement beyond the control of the pro-corporate union leadership. Reject the nationalist poison pushed by O\u2019Brien and the union bureaucracy, defend immigrant workers, and create communication networks with warehouse and retail workers globally.\n\nCostco workers must recognize that this fight is not just about one contract\u2014it is a political struggle against an entire system of exploitation now led by an openly fascistic government that threatens workers\u2019 existence. The Teamsters leadership has proven itself to be an obstacle to workers\u2019 power, and it must be bypassed. Only through independent organization and direct action can workers secure the wages, benefits, and conditions they deserve.",

The discount retailer is benefiting from a resilient economic backdrop while capitalizing on an ongoing e-commerce expansion. Its latest update highlighted further growth momentum to kick off 2025.\n\nWith the stock up 47% over the past year and currently trading at an all-time high, can the rally keep going? Let's discuss what to do with shares of Costco Wholesale.\n\nThe case to buy or hold Costco stock\n\nWith 139 million cardholders worldwide, Costco's members-only store concept remains massively popular. Its loyal customer base is attracted to low prices on a variety of items, from everyday essentials to jewelry, electronics, and furniture. Access to exclusive deals, including discounted gasoline, travel services, and an in-store pharmacy, means that for many people, the annual membership fee is a no-brainer.\n\nCostco's ability to pull in new members and keep them within its retail ecosystem highlights the power of its operating model and the attraction of the stock as a possible investment.\n\nThe recent trends have been impressive. Costco recently reported its January results (for the period ended Feb. 2), with net sales up 9.2% year over year and total company comparable store sales increasing by 9.8% during the month, excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.\n\nPerhaps the bigger story has been Costco's success at building out its e-commerce business, with segment comparable sales 13.6% higher than the same month last year. This dynamic is important as it represents a new growth driver, allowing Costco to leverage its extensive logistics infrastructure with a more diversified merchandise mix to reach a wider consumer market online.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, Costco is on track to generate a solid 7% revenue increase this year and in 2026. The runway includes the hike to the U.S. and Canada membership pricing announced last year, lifting the top line and profitability margins as the plans renew at a modestly higher rate. Costco intends to open 20 new warehouses in the remainder of fiscal 2025 as a tailwind for new memberships. The forecast for earnings per share (EPS) is even stronger, climbing at around a 10% annual rate for the next two years.\n\nInvestors convinced that Costco is well-positioned to continue its path of steady, profitable growth as it expands internationally have plenty of reasons to buy the stock.\n\nMetric 2025 Estimate 2026 Estimate Revenue (in billions) $272.8 $291.9 Revenue growth (YOY) 7.2% 7% Earnings per share (EPS) $18.18 $19.98 EPS growth (YOY) 9.8% 9.9%\n\nThe case to sell Costco stock\n\nThere's a lot to like about Costco, with all indications that its outlook is as strong as ever, supported by solid fundamentals. On the other hand, the apparent optimism toward the company's retail dominance has translated directly into an objectively expensive valuation. Shares of Costco are trading at 58 times its consensus 2025 EPS estimate, a level well above peers like Walmart and Amazon, each with a forward P/E ratio closer to 37.\n\nThe market appears to be assigning Costco an earnings premium based precisely on its membership-based model and consistent execution history. While this metric alone doesn't mean the stock needs to sell off anytime soon, the concern is that it could at least limit the upside in the share price against already high expectations. All this is in an environment that faces other uncertainties with Costco being exposed to broader macroeconomic conditions. While details have not been confirmed, proposed trade tariffs by the Trump administration have the potential to generate some supply chain disruptions or inflationary cost pressures as an operating headwind.\n\nInvestors who believe Costco will be challenged to achieve its financial targets and see room for membership performance metrics to slow going forward could consider selling or at least avoiding the stock.\n\nCOST PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nDecision time\n\nI believe shares of Costco are just too pricey to buy today with conviction. There are likely enough strong points for shareholders to continue holding, but investors sitting on the sidelines may find more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the stock market. Nevertheless, this is one stock to keep on your radar for the possibility of a market correction that might offer a chance to acquire shares at a lower and more attractive price.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently took a deep dive into the challenges facing the consumer packaged goods sector, offering his perspective on the factors driving the decline of these stocks.\n\n\u201cThe recent decline in the consumer packaged goods stocks, I find it breathtaking\u2026 Why is this happening? The truth is, there are a host of reasons, and every time you think that things have gotten better, they seem to have gotten worse, much worse than you've imagined.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 9 Stocks and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks Leading the Dow Higher in 2025\n\nCramer noted that many companies within the sector seem to believe that younger consumers will settle for smaller portions of food and that this might mitigate some of the challenges. While Cramer acknowledged that this shift in consumer behavior is part of the equation, he argued that many companies are overlooking the significant impact of GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These medications, which curb cravings for junk food, pose a serious threat, as Cramer sees them as something that could be widely adopted in the United States. He then added:\n\n\u201cOh, and let's not forget about the problem of tariffs. You're getting some sudden price increases for many goods. Someone has to pay for the tariffs. These companies hope it will be you because if it's not you, it's them.\u201d\n\nAnother significant challenge for companies in the packaged goods space is the difficulty of raising prices. Cramer explained that while many companies try to increase prices, they often face fierce competition from major retailers and online marketplaces, which offer private-label products that consumers increasingly recognize as being just as good as the branded alternatives.\n\nWhile private labels are not seeing explosive growth at the moment, Cramer pointed out that they are exerting pressure on all prices, including those of established brands. Furthermore, Cramer observed that the price hikes implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to consumer fatigue, with many shoppers now seeking better value.",

If you have a great burger with cold, floppy fries on the side, suddenly that burger doesn\u2019t taste as good. Whether you\u2019re getting the combo from a fast food restaurant like McDonald\u2019s, a sit-down casual chain like Red Robin, or at home, the quality of one often affects your perception of the other.\n\nMaking a good burger at home is undoubtedly easier than making good fries from scratch, hence why we usually opt for frozen. And if you have tried many brands of frozen fries and always been disappointed, there\u2019s good news. If you\u2019re willing to try one more, Costco's latest frozen find may be what you\u2019ve been searching for.\n\nNew Kirkland Signature Extra Crispy French Fries\n\nInstagram's @costcohotfinds recently introduced followers (and us) to a new product at the warehouse store: Kirkland Signature Extra Crispy French Fries. The french fries come in a 5-pound bag and can be baked or air-fried. Laura Lamb, who runs the Instagram account, opted for the latter option, using the air fryer to cook the fries for 16 minutes at 400 degrees F.\n\n\u201cThese came out so good,\u201d Lamb said in the video. \u201cThey\u2019re crispy and they have the best flavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese rock in the air fryer!\u201d one follower commented.\n\n\u201cOhhh my kids are fries connoisseurs lol I\u2019ll have to pick some up,\u201d said of her followers. Another parent had high hopes for the new fries. \u201cWhenever I go get my kids nuggets at Costco I always have to go to a different store to get fries to go with them so I\u2019m actually pretty excited,\u201d she said.\n\nThe promise of these \u201cextra crispy\u201c fries is enough to make us skip the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru the next time a fry craving strikes. The price is pretty good, too\u2014a 5-pound bag costs just $6.79, leading one commenter to say, \u201cThat price. Gotta make space in the freezer now.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course, you can eat these fries plain or with ketchup, but we love the idea of a good, flavorful dip. We have several variations of Fry Sauce on Allrecipes including Spicy Fry Sauce, Idaho Fry Sauce, and European Fry Sauce, and with a 5-pound bag to go through, you can try all three.\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best stocks to buy for financial stability.\n\nInvesting in stocks is one of the most effective ways to build long-term financial stability. While stocks can be volatile in the short term, history has shown that they generate higher returns over time compared to other asset classes. With the right strategy, investing in stocks can help individuals accumulate wealth, hedge against inflation, and secure a comfortable retirement. Stocks have historically outperformed other investment vehicles, such as bonds and savings accounts. According to data from the S&P 500, the stock market has delivered an average annual return of about 10% before inflation over the past century. In contrast, bonds have yielded around 5\u20136%, while traditional savings accounts provide returns of less than 1% annually. Recent studies reinforce this trend. A 2024 report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that over any 20-year period, the likelihood of losing money in the stock market is close to zero. Even with market downturns, those who stay invested tend to see significant growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe power of compounding is a key reason why investing in stocks enhances financial stability. The earlier an individual starts investing, the greater the impact of compounding. For example, if an investor puts $5,000 annually into an index fund earning 8% per year, they would accumulate approximately $1.3 million over 40 years. This long-term growth potential allows individuals to plan for major life events, such as purchasing a home, funding education, or retiring comfortably. The US Federal Reserve reports that individuals with investment portfolios of at least $100,000 are significantly more likely to achieve financial security than those relying solely on savings. While stocks can be volatile, diversification helps reduce risk. A well-balanced portfolio containing stocks from different sectors, as well as international investments, can mitigate losses during market downturns.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires to compile a list of stock options that can provide financial stability to investors. These stocks belong to defensive sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and energy. Many of these companies have solid dividend histories and enjoy a stable market position. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

That\u2019s flat wrong.\n\nTo understand why, start by reflecting on the actual proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (where I work). It merely asked Costco\u2019s board to \u201cconduct an evaluation and publish a report \u2026 on the risks of the Company maintaining its DEI roles, policies and goals.\u201d Given all the obvious risks surrounding DEI these days, including reputational, legal, and regulatory risks, this request is squarely focused on appropriate shareholder concerns. So why vote against it?\n\nTo answer that question, we should start with the Big 5, which includes the Big 3 asset managers \u2013 BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street \u2013 along with the Big 2 proxy advisers \u2013 Glass Lewis and ISS. While difficult to calculate precisely, the combined Costco votes attributable to this Big 5, either directly or indirectly, is likely over 50%. One thing we know about the Big 5 is that they have been under tremendous pressure for supporting ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and DEI agendas in partisan ways. Prior to this onslaught of pressure, they would routinely support left-leaning ESG and DEI proposals while voting against essentially identical proposals from the right. Their response to the recent pressure appears to be a decision to drop their support of left-leaning proposals in order to reduce or eliminate the appearance of bias. Accordingly, the related Costco \u201cagainst\u201d votes can be attributed to a broad risk-avoidance strategy rather than an embrace of DEI. In other words, either strategy \u2013 voting for more conservative proposals or voting for less leftist proposals \u2013 would work to reduce the pressure, but the message of the vote either way is \u201cwe\u2019re getting out of the partisan voting game,\u201d not \u201cwe love DEI.\u201d\n\nThe situation may be analogized to proxy adviser Egan-Jones recently announcing that it would not vote in favor of merit-based hiring proposals because of challenges defining merit. Accordingly, Egan-Jones adopted the position that it would neither support merit-based nor DEI-based hiring proposals. To conclude from this that Egan-Jones supports DEI when it votes against merit-based hiring proposals is a bridge to far. I have also heard a proxy adviser announce they would never vote for a report because reports are a waste of resources. One can agree or disagree with that assessment, but clearly that adviser isn\u2019t voting for DEI when they vote against our proposal \u2013 they\u2019re voting against another report.\n\nAnd even if one counts the votes of the Big 5 as embracing DEI, the concerns about those votes being conflicted \u2013 because all 5 make money on ESG and DEI unrelated to the performance of the individual company holding the vote \u2013 warrant discounting them. (More on that below.)\n\nNext in the analysis comes Costco\u2019s management, because so many shareholders simply default to following management and even those who don\u2019t automatically do so were likely swayed by the disturbing hostility Costco expressed towards the National Center and its proposal. I have previously analyzed all the problems with Costco\u2019s explanations for its opposition, including the bias evident in its ad hominem attacks, and you can read that here. For now, it may suffice to say that Costco likely wishes it had negotiated a withdrawal of the proposal after 19 Attorneys General followed the shareholder vote with a letter urging Costco \u201cto end all unlawful discrimination imposed by the company through diversity, equity, and inclusion (\u2018DEI\u2019) policies.\u201d\n\nGiven that last year 20% of outstanding Costco shares apparently went unvoted, the combined influence of the Big 5 and Costco\u2019s management likely accounts for the vast bulk of the voting. Add to that pension funds and endowments ideologically captured by the DEI mind virus and you\u2019ve likely accounted for all the votes against.\n\nAt this point, the reader may push back and argue that to conclude shareholders shouldn\u2019t have voted against our proposal is not the same thing as concluding they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s true as far as it goes, but our system of corporate governance cares about the legitimacy of votes. Accordingly, votes cast by the Big 3 on behalf of those invested in their funds (the \u201ctrue owners,\u201d according to Larry Fink), as well as votes influenced by the recommendations of the Big 2, should be discounted if those votes are conflicted or in breach of a relevant duty. On this point, the reader might want to review a letter from over 20 state financial officers sent to the Big 5 and raising the prospect of the Big 5 using their control of shareholder votes to engage in \u201cthe most severe breach of the fiduciary standard in American history.\u201d In addition, votes cast by shareholders misinformed by Costco\u2019s opposition statement should be similarly discounted.\n\nIn the end, one simply can\u2019t conclude that the votes cast against our proposal can be legitimately described as votes for DEI. The combination of misinformation and bias, together with the terms of the proposal itself, simply precludes such a conclusion.",

While Costco croissants are legendary they tweaked the traditional almond croissant and even changed the shape, and fans are going wild. \"Calling all my croissant \ud83e\udd50 lovers, @costco just dropped a new Almond Croissant Pastry that captures all the best parts of an almond croissant in a unique, circular shape!\" she captained the clip. \"A box of 6 costs $11.99 but keep in mind these are pretty large pastries!\"\n\nCostco Carrot Cake Is Likely Coming Soon\n\nAnd, in a few months, they will likely carry their famous Costco carrot cake, which is generally available around Easter. \"Their carrot cake is amazing. The apricot filling is delicious and it's a true cream cheese frosting, not some whipped light/fluffy cream cheese,\" writes one.",

Yes, you read that right. The same ultra big-box store known for those viral food court hot dogs, Costco, is also the single biggest seller of organic produce.\n\nAs of 2016, Costco had emerged as the top dog purveyor of organic produce in the U.S., outranking Whole Foods and raking in sales to the tune of $4 billion annually. These numbers have only continued to skyrocket in recent years. Costco's organic sales totaled $6 billion just this past year. Put into perspective, Costco sales account for one-tenth of all organic produce sales in the country, proving its dominance in the category wasn't a fluke, but an indication of its larger commitment to the organic market.",

The vote puts Costco executives in a tight spot of serving the wishes of shareholders or acquiescing to Bird and her friends.\n\nBird\u2019s office issued a news release with the letter, quoting her saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to ditch DEI. While other companies right the ship and abandon their illegal, woke policies, Costco has doubled down. I\u2019m putting Costco on notice to do the right thing and eliminate discriminatory DEI. No American should be denied an opportunity because they don\u2019t fit the woke mold.\u201d\n\nBird continued, \u201cCostco needs to show us the proof that they are following the law because they have public statements that cause us great concern. Many other big retailers have changed their policies and are now following federal law, just like President Trump is doing with his executive orders rooting out DEI.\u201d\n\nIrony abounds considering this comes from a lawyer who touts her prosecutorial experience, where those accused of wrongdoing are presumed innocent. And it comes from an administrator who should know the burden of proving non-compliance with employment laws rests on the government, not the employer.\n\nEven so, Bird said Costco executives and directors \u201cneed to make sure they\u2019re actually doing the right thing here. That\u2019s what we\u2019re keeping an eye on, and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll look at all available options.\u201d\n\nYou do not need a bunch of red MAGA caps hanging in your closet to know what \u201call available options\u201d means in Bird\u2019s eyes. But not all legal scholars share the conclusions asserted by these attorneys general.\n\nPlus, those not wearing MAGA caps might wonder if Iowa\u2019s attorney general has bigger issues closer to home, considering Costco only has four stores in Iowa, in Ankeny, Coralville, Davenport and West Des Moines. Some in Iowa might wonder when we can expect Bird to issue similar \u201cwe expect you to follow the law \u2014 or else\u201d warnings to businesses with a larger presence in our state and demand they send her proof of their compliance.\n\nThose warnings might include putting companies like CRST or Heartland Express on notice that Bird will \u201clook at all available options\u201d if their trucks break the speed limit or exceed weight limits.\n\nOr a warning might go to Iowa Select Farms, putting the hog confinement company on notice that Bird will \u201clook at all available options\u201d if its animals end up polluting Iowa rivers, lakes and drinking water.\n\nWill Bird put the fear of God into the owners of Iowa nursing homes, such as Care Initiatives and Aspire/Beacon Health, that she and her staff will bring down the wrath of state government on them if they do not fully comply with government regulations designed to protect their residents?\n\nFair-minded as she professes, it is hard to imagine Iowa\u2019s attorney general will use politics to select those she targets with letters to shape up and abandon what she deems are \u201cwoke\u201d policies.\n\nSince taking office in 2023, Bird filed or joined other states in at least nine lawsuits challenging policies of Joe Biden's administration. Now, with Biden gone and time on her hands, it appears Bird is turning her attention to businesses whose actions or internal policies do not square with the agenda she is taking from our new president.\n\nYet, anyone who steps into Iowa courtrooms knows passionate litigators present two or more sides to an issue. Just look at Trump\u2019s attempted executive order to cancel the constitutional amendment granting \u201cbirthright citizenship.\u201d\n\nIt is the same with his and Bird\u2019s attempt to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusion policies in business, not just government \u2014 even though these policies on their face seek equal treatment, rather than command discrimination, in hiring, pay, advancement or retention.\n\nHusch Blackwell LLP, a Kansas City law firm with offices across the United States, sent a client alert last week to help employers stay on the right side of the dividing line between legal and unlawful corporate DEI policies.\n\nThe firm advised, \u201cThe vast majority of DEI programs and policies currently utilized by most employers \u2014 which include employee resource groups, optional DEI and bias trainings, and strategies for diversifying candidate pools for recruiting purposes \u2014 would appear to fall well outside the definition of \u2018illegal\u2019 practices under existing law.\u201d\n\nThe alert added, \u201cIndeed, the former chair of the EEOC (the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) made clear in a 2023 press release that it \u2018remains lawful for employers to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs that seek to ensure workers of all backgrounds are afford equal opportunity in the workplace.'\u201d\n\nHusch Blackwell told employers they can use lawful DEI programs so long as they avoid quotas and focus their workplace initiatives on promoting inclusion without implementing discriminatory practices. Employers, it said, should use a broad definition of diversity that includes such characteristics as veteran status and life experience, not race, gender or other characteristics.\n\nThat brings us back to Bird, who seemingly wants it both ways.\n\nTo hear her, Costco should drop statements confirming a desire to have its workforce reflect the breadth of its communities, including the four in Iowa.\n\nMeanwhile, on job postings on Bird\u2019s Iowa attorney general website, this notation appears with a listing for a \u201cfarm and freedom lawyer:\u201d \u201cThe State of Iowa is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified individuals are encouraged to apply.\u201d\n\nDo you suppose Bird intends to follow affirmative action guidelines, even if her friends think they are woke?\n\nRandy Evans is a retired journalist.

            "content": "Despite its entrenched position in the U.S. retail sector, this powerful discount chain still has the characteristics of a growth stock.\n\nSome investors might automatically assume Costco (COST -3.93%) is an established, slow-growing company. They would be right on one count, but wrong on the other. It is certainly an established leader. But it's not slow-growing. In fact, the membership-based wholesale retailer's earnings per share grew by a high-teens percentage in its fiscal 2024, which ended Sept. 1. Further, sales in the months since then have accelerated compared to fiscal 2024, setting up the company for a great 2025.\n\nPut simply, Costco is still a growth stock. This is important to understand because it helps justify its premium valuation.\n\nAccelerating sales growth\n\nHelping fuel Costco's 17% year-over-year increase in earnings per share in fiscal 2024 was a 6% jump in comparable sales, adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in gasoline prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Impressively, this was an acceleration from 5% adjusted comps growth in fiscal 2023.\n\nOf course, it's not too surprising that Costco's growth accelerated in fiscal 2024. The company's sales are normalizing after coming off of extremely tough comparisons to the years of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, for instance, Costco's adjusted comparable sales rose 13% and 11%, respectively. As people's shopping habits normalized in the years following the pandemic, its growth rates naturally moderated. In fiscal 2024, however, Costco's growth rates moved upward again as the prior years of elevated growth levels faded further into the rear-view mirror.\n\nBut what's really surprising is how fiscal 2025 is shaping up for the retailer. Costco's adjusted comparable sales growth rates for its retail months of December and January (which are not precisely aligned with the calendar months), for instance, were significantly above fiscal 2024 levels -- at 9.9% and 9.8%, respectively. Even more, a further adjustment to account for the fact that Costco's December results were positively impacted by a 15% boost due to the timing of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday compared to the year-ago December shows that the company's momentum is actually accelerating.\n\nPowerful catalysts\n\nStrengthening the bull case even more, there's good reason to believe that Costco's high growth rates are sustainable for the foreseeable future. This is due to the company's ongoing international expansion and its e-commerce rollout.\n\nThe strength of these two parts of Costco's business is highlighted by their outsized growth rates relative to the overall business. For example, the membership-based retailer's adjusted comparable sales in Canada and the company's \"other international\" segments both rose by about 8% in fiscal 2024, approximately 2 percentage points faster than the company's total growth rate. In addition, Costco's adjusted comparable sales coming from e-commerce sources soared by 16%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, strength in these segments has persisted into 2025. The company reported January adjusted comparable sales growth rates for Canada, other international, and e-commerce of 12.3%, 10%, and 15.2%, respectively.\n\nWith 617 of its 897 warehouse stores in the U.S. and 767 in North America, the company has significant room for international expansion. Further, the company is arguably under-penetrated in e-commerce channels, so its efforts to streamline this part of its business will help it capitalize on plenty of low-hanging fruit.\n\nCombining Costco's accelerating growth and its powerful catalysts with the magic of the company's overall business, including its extremely low prices, 90% renewal rate on memberships, and its ability to increase its annual membership prices over time, it's easy to see why the stock trades at a premium valuation of more than 61 times earnings.\n\nCostco is a growth stock with powerful and sustainable catalysts, and it should trade like one.",

            "content": "Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "From tires and gas to renting and buying cars, learn if these auto services are worthwhile\n\nCostco quickly became popular with customers after it opened its first location in 1983. Now, it seems like more people than ever are looking to shop at this membership-only warehouse chain. One of the main draws is the significant discounts that members receive on its inventory, but it goes just beyond groceries. Costco has several deals on vehicle-related services too that seem quite appealing! But are they worth a Costco membership? Below, auto experts share their thoughts on what Costco has to offer car owners, from tires to buying cars!\n\nCostco gas\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping at a Costco location, the warehouse chain\u2019s gas stations make it easy to fuel up your car. According to the company\u2019s website, you can buy regular gasoline (usually 87 octane), premium gasoline (91 octane) and diesel at select locations.\n\nBesides the perk of lower prices, Costco also promises a speedy experience thanks to one-way traffic. This may sound like a hassle, but the stations have extra-long hoses so you can reach your gas tank regardless of which side it\u2019s on.\n\nOne caveat for using the station: Though you don\u2019t need to be a Costco member, you at least need a Costco Shop Card at the pumps\u2014and only members can purchase these gift cards.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cIt is okay,\u201d says Chris Pyle, an auto expert on JustAnswer (the expert on-demand platform). \u201cIt all comes from the same place anyway, then it gets some special additives added to it before arriving at the gas station. Plus, Costco members get a few cents off.\u201d\n\nCostco tires\n\nhelen89/Getty\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that tires aren\u2019t cheap, but Costco promises that other tire shops can\u2019t beat its prices. How the process works: You search online for the tires you need by entering your license plate, vehicle or tire size information. Once you choose tires, you schedule your installation at a Costco Tire Center. The tires are then delivered to that center (free of charge!) and you\u2019ll get them installed on the day of your appointment.\n\nThe process includes rotation, balancing and nitrogen tire inflation, as well as a warranty for mileage and hazards for the tires themselves.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cCostco tires are just as good as anywhere else, as they are well-known tire brands,\u201d comments Pyle. \u201cCostco buys in quantity, so they get discounts which they pass along to you as a member.\u201d\n\nCostco repair services\n\nLike new tires, the appeal of getting routine maintenance done on your vehicle at Costco is it will cost less than other garages. The Costco Auto Program offers a 15% discount on service, parts and accessories. This means up to $500 per visit!\n\nThe program applies to any car used in a Costco member\u2019s household, and can be used for services involving wheel alignment, brakes and more.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cYou will likely not find highly trained techs there, but they have done the minor things hundreds of times over and over and can do them well,\u201d says Pyle. \u201cTheir tool availability and skills will be at the lower end of the spectrum. So they will not be able to tackle failures with brakes, suspension, steering, engine, transmission, electrical, and driveline.\u201d\n\nCostco auto parts\n\nNeed a new battery, filter, wipers or oil for your car? It may be worth shopping at the warehouse chain, as it can save you money on these normally expensive parts. Since the company gets bulk discounts on the items, that means a lower cost for you.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cIt may not be OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts, but rarely is it the cheapest aftermarket stuff,\u201d comments Pyle. Midline parts and fluids will still meet OEM standards.\n\nCostco car buying service\n\nIonut Moldoveanu / 500px/Getty\n\nThe next time you\u2019re looking for a new or used vehicle, consider doing your shopping through Costco. The company says it has removed the negotiation process and instead focuses on three key elements.\n\nPrearranged pricing. This means members get savings right off the bat, as well as some manufacturer incentives. Member Support . Advocates are there if you have questions and can make you feel comfortable and confident in your purchase. Approved dealers. Dealers are trained before they work with Costco members nationwide to help facilitate their car-buying experience.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cOne of the best parts of buying through Costco Auto is you don\u2019t need to haggle over price\u2014the prices are already negotiated for you,\u201d says Lauren Fix, sector analyst and industry expert for The Car Coach & Car Smarts Brands. \u201cIf you go through all the steps of buying a car through Costco Auto and find you\u2019re not happy with the deal, you can always walk away.\u201d\n\nBut as Fix points out, you can also work with the Costco call center and talk to a representative over the phone if you feel uncomfortable completing the process online. \u201cThen, you\u2019ll receive the dealer\u2019s contact information so you can set up an appointment,\u201d she adds.\n\nShopping Hyundai Cars Now on Amazon\u2014Here\u2019s How You Can Get Yours Today! People looking to buy a new car can avoid the hassle of heading to a dealership thanks to Amazon. The global e-commerce giant announced that customers interested in a new Hyundai vehicle can now do so through the Amazon Autos program. They will have the ability to browse, order and even secure financing through Amazon. [\u2026]\n\nCostco car rentals\n\nAs part of Costco Travel, members (who are at least 25 years old) have the ability to rent vehicles. Once you enter your pick-up and drop-off location, the date and the time, you\u2019ll be able to see what\u2019s available for rent.\n\nThe website states that the company\u2019s low price finder \u201cwill automatically calculate the best applicable coupon combinable with the Costco member discount, based on the length of rental, car type, location, reservation and travel dates.\u201d\n\nThe additional driver fee is also waived for Almon, Enterprise, Avis and Budget for rentals in the U.S. and some international countries.\n\nWhat the experts say: \u201cCostco does offer lower prices on rental services,\u201d says Fix. \u201cIt is important to shop around for the best prices.\u201d\n\nPyle adds that generally this is a good deal. \u201cYou get a little discount with your membership,\u201d he says. \u201cThe experience and process is the same being done from Costco or at a rental agency, the overall bill though is a little less, maybe 5-10% less.\u201d",

There are some Costco membership rules that one should never consider breaking, as the warehouse can ban you if you do. One rule applies to the self-checkout process. If you've ever thought about using someone else's membership card to go through the self-checkout, think again. At the self-service checkout registers, Costco staff will ask members to show their membership cards, and membership cards at Costco should always only be used by the actual member themselves. Per Costco's policy, while members can each bring up to two guests to the warehouse, guests without memberships are actually not allowed to make purchases.\n\nSo while you can technically make the most of your Costco haul by going with a friend, the Costco membership card and benefits are non-transferable, as Costco's policy clearly states. Violating any of Costco's policy can result in a ban.

A serious outbreak of the H5N1 virus, known as the avian flu, is hitting the poultry industry \u2014 resulting in supply disruptions where prices are low, and often surging price tags where cartons are available.\n\n\"Due to ongoing issues with the supply of eggs, we are currently limiting egg purchases to one dozen per customer, per day, in all Trader Joe\u2019s stores across the country,\" Nakia Rohde, Trader Joe's public relations manager, told Food & Wine via email. \"We hope these limits will help to ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe\u2019s.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a sign at one New York City outpost read: \u201cDue to the ongoing issues with the supply of eggs, we kindly ask you to limit your purchase to 1 dozen eggs of any kind. We hope to have ample supply soon!\u201d\n\nTrader Joe's in New York City started capping egg purchases last week. Courtesy of Nicolette Baker\n\nJust last week, members of the r/TraderJoes subreddit were championing the national chain for its comparatively low pricing \u2014 and judging from the bare shelves shown in social media videos online, it looks like they weren\u2019t alone in their appreciation. Some even report rushing to their local grocer at dawn to secure their dozen. A representative for the chain didn\u2019t immediately respond to our request for further comment.\n\nThe grocery realtor is apparently not the only chain monitoring egg sales. According to NBC, bulk-supply favorite Costco is also reportedly responding to customer demand at some locations with a three-dozen limit. Over on TikTok, social media users\u2019 videos pan to extended lines, full-to-the-brim carts, and chaotic scenes of eggs broken on the ground. Costco didn\u2019t immediately respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe poultry industry is feeling the squeeze after months of the outbreak, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports the death of some 136 million hens (around 8% of the egg-laying population) last fall. Prices have likewise skyrocketed to match pace with demand \u2014 which has led some restaurants, notably Waffle House, to tack on a temporary surcharge for orders of the breakfast staple. Despite consumer concerns, experts say fully cooked eggs are still safe to consume as the presence of H5N1 in consumer eggs is extremely rare.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low,\u201d the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously shared in an email statement. \u201cProperly cooking eggs is effective to destroy pathogens, including H5N1.\u201d\n\nBird flu has been detected in flocks across all 50 states. Egg shortages began ramping up in early January, and it\u2019s unclear exactly when costs \u2014 and retailers\u2019 supplies \u2014 might even out. In the meantime, might we suggest stocking up on a few cans of chickpeas, instead?\n\n",

The laws set minimum space for chickens or cage-free requirements for egg-laying hens. They\u2019ve already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan.

Grocery Outlet Holding Corp. in the northern district of California.\n\nAt the crux of the complaint is losses sustained by investors from November 2023 to May 2024. The federal securities case maintains that Grocery Outlet and its then-leaders shared what the plaintiff deems to be misleading statements and potentially concealed information related to the retailer\u2019s transition to new and upgraded tech platforms.\n\nIn May 2024, Grocery Outlet reported worse-than-expected results and a lowered full-year outlook, which it attributed to tech challenges, among other factors.

A user on Reddit shared a photo of the 4.5-pound Tiramisu Cheesecake, perfect for pleasing a crowd \u2014 or a very dedicated party of one. The latest addition to Costco's long line of popular bakery desserts takes inspiration from the classic Italian cake, tiramisu, featuring a graham and cocoa crust, cold brew whipped topping, and mascarpone cheese in the batter.\n\nWhile this indulgent treat is unlikely to be made from scratch in a Costco bakery, it is available in the refrigerated section for $23.99. The Reddit poster confirmed that the product was found at a Costco location in Washington, sparking excitement among other members in the United States eager to find the new bakery item at their local warehouse. One user commented, \"My two favorite things in one!!\" Another joked, \"This could be dangerous,\" because the treat looks so good.\n\nRead more: The Vanilla Ice Cream That Uses The Best Ingredients Hands Down\n\nIs This New Costco Bakery Treat The Best Of Both Worlds?\n\nClassic slice of tiramisu on a plate - Reza Moshiri/Shutterstock\n\nCostco's bakery aisles have previously featured both tiramisu and New York-style cheesecake, but it is the combination of the two that has members especially excited. However, one lucky shopper who tried the product firsthand claimed the dessert didn't quite live up to expectations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The cheesecake itself is actually coffee flavored and it's strong. The whipped topping was normal and not coffee flavored,\" the user wrote on Reddit, adding that the crust was somewhat lacking in flavor, with only faint traces of chocolate or mascarpone. That said, those who love the taste of strong coffee will likely enjoy this treat.\n\nIf the tiramisu cheesecake hasn't yet arrived at your local Costco, you may be able to craft a DIY version using two other Kirkland Signature bakery items. Costco famously offers a 12-inch plain cheesecake at most store locations \u2014 and if you're lucky, you might also spot the Tiramisu Bar Cake, which appears to be available on a seasonal basis. Until the new tiramisu cheesecake lands in your local Costco, a little creative combination of these two bakery items might be the next best thing.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

The big drawback is the way rewards are redeemed: once a year, and in the form of a certificate that you typically have to redeem at a physical store.\n\nThat will feel a little too old-fashioned for some consumers. But if you can deal with the paperwork hassle, there are plenty of ways to leverage the card to your advantage. Here\u2019s how to make the most of the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi.\n\nLeverage bonus categories\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nWhen you\u2019re buying gas, the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi is a good card to use. It earns 5% cash back at Costco gas stations and 4% back on gas and EV charging purchases elsewhere, on up to $7,000 in combined spending in those categories a year (1% after that). Those are impressive rates, even when compared with the best gas credit cards on the market. Even if you only get your gas from non-Costco-branded stations, if you max out the annual cap you'll earn $280 per year on gas alone, not including the 1% back on any purchases in the category beyond that.\n\nUsing the card for your restaurant and travel spending is also a solid choice because it earns 3% back in both of those categories, with no spending cap. That's also a hard deal to beat, even among the best credit cards for restaurant spending.\n\nOddly, your returns for using the card at Costco or Costco.com aren't as generous. You'll get 2% cash back on those purchases, which certainly isn't bad by any means. But other store credit cards \u2014 like Amazon's Prime Visa, for instance \u2014 offer as much as 5% back when you shop within the brand.\n\nAnd if you typically do your grocery shopping at Costco, consider that many of the best credit cards for groceries earn far more than 2% back on those kinds of purchases \u2014 as long as you buy them at a supermarket and not a wholesale club.\n\nWhatever card you're using on actual Costco purchases, make sure it's earning you the most cash back possible.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi has an annual fee of $0, but you can't get the card unless you're a Costco member. Store memberships start at $65.\n\nUse a different card if you\u2019re only going to earn 1% back\n\nIf you have a separate flat-rate cash-back card that earns 1.5% back or 2% back on all purchases, then you\u2019ll want to use that one for your spending outside of the bonus categories offered by the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi, which will earn you just 1% back on those expenses.\n\nYou may also want to switch to that flat-rate card once you hit the annual spending limit on gasoline with the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi because at that point your rewards rate with the Costco card also drops down to 1%.\n\nAnd if you have a different credit card that earns 5% back in rotating bonus categories, it may change your calculus a bit more. The Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae, for example, earns 5% back in rotating bonus categories on up to $1,500 per quarter (activation required; 1% back on everything else). Its previous bonus categories have overlapped with some of those offered by the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi \u2014 but Chase has also traditionally included bonus categories that the Costco card doesn't: home improvement stores, streaming services, grocery stores and Amazon, for example.\n\nKeep an eye on your bonus calendars to ensure you're earning the most you can.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\nTake advantage of perks and protections\n\nFor a cash-back card, the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi makes for a really solid travel buddy. It charges no foreign transaction fees, for starters, and since it's a Visa you'll enjoy widespread international acceptance.\n\nThe card also comes with worldwide car rental insurance, travel and emergency assistance and roadside assistance service.\n\nAs for shopping, the card also has your back with damage and theft purchase protection (if items purchased with the card are damaged or stolen within 120 days), and fraud protection that makes the card easy to turn on or off.\n\nThe card also offers Citi Entertainment, which can grant you early access to tickets for things like concerts and sporting events.\n\nHow to redeem rewards on the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi\n\nRedemption with the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi takes an unusual form: Cardholders receive a cash-back reward certificate once a year when the February billing statement closes. Then, they can redeem that certificate at any Costco store, which makes it especially useful for big-ticket items. But the certificate isn't redeemable online. Although, in 2022 Costco added an option for cardmembers who have earned $500 or more in rewards. They could choose to redeem their rewards certificate as a direct deposit into a bank account.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAlmost a year after Costco Wholesale\u2019s long-time finance chief stepped down from the CFO post he held for roughly four decades, Richard Galanti has retired and left the company: He clocked his final official workday on Jan. 30.\n\nIt\u2019s been something of a long, bittersweet goodbye. As planned, since March Galanti has served in an advisory role after handing the finance reins to his successor, Costco\u2019s current CFO Gary Millerchip. Galanti has also served as executive vice president and a member of the company\u2019s board of directors, according to a securities filing. He attended his last annual meeting in January.\n\nBut old habits are hard to break. Galanti was back in the Issaquah, Washington-based company\u2019s offices Tuesday, collecting a few personal things he\u2019d left behind. \u201cHe\u2019s still here today cleaning out his desk,\u201d said David Sherwood, vice president, financial planning and investors relations at Costco. Sherwood described Galanti as an executive who was steeped in the company\u2019s culture and a \u201ctough to replace\u201d steward of the company, who is \u201ceverybody\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with his nickname as the \u201cvoice\u201d of Costco to Wall Street, who is known for his ability to tease out the stories and trends behind the company\u2019s numbers, Galanti called sister publication CFO Dive Tuesday from his car to tell his parting tale. \u201cI went to grab a couple pictures off the wall,\u201d he said, along with some other personal knick-knacks he\u2019d left behind in his old office, noting that he wasn\u2019t returning on official business.\n\nLooking back, he expressed gratitude for having had the opportunity to be part of the retailer\u2019s growth trajectory. Coscto had 896 warehouses as of Nov. 24, according to its latest quarterly report. Galanti first cut his retail teeth working in his family\u2019s Atlanta grocery business, CFO Dive previously reported. He joined the warehouse club retailer back in 1984 when it was just opening its first three locations in the Pacific Northwest and he was just two weeks shy of his 28th birthday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Galanti also shared some of his thoughts on succession planning, his future, and what he will miss. In terms of an ideal time period for a typical executive transition, Galanti said he\u2019d advise about two to three months. In the case of Millerchip, an experienced finance executive and former CFO of Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocer Kroger, his successor was \u201cgood to go from the beginning.\u201d Galanti said his decision to stay through the year was not related to the time needed to help Millerchip transition into the CFO role.\n\nAsked what Galanti will miss at the company, he first noted that \u201cfirst and foremost, that will be the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly you miss being in the game,\u201d he said, noting that he has plans to put his business experience to use on corporate boards. Looking ahead, Galanti said he also has plans to spend more time with family and travel.\n\nThere is one thing that he hasn\u2019t loved, and that is the increased regulations that public companies must grapple with. \u201cI won\u2019t miss the ongoing increasing complexity of running a business,\u201d he said, noting that he has always joked about the rising number of acronyms that are now part of retail which is, at its heart, a very simple business. \u201cYou buy stuff and you sell stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past year, Galanti\u2019s departure has been well-feted. There have been numerous celebrations, Sherwood recalled in an interview Tuesday. Galanti also was honored in other ways, including with a lifetime achievement award from the CFO Leadership Council, which noted that Costco has become a \u201cglobal powerhouse\u201d under his leadership.\n\nAmong the public farewells, there was one notably heartfelt exchange that pierced the routine earnings protocol during the final call hosted by Galanti last year. \u201cI feel like we should be, like raising your jersey to the rafters like a superstar is retiring here,\u201d said one analyst, according to a transcript of the March 7, 2024 call. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d",

            "content": "Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) has emerged as one of the world's most successful retailers. Its strategy of selling high-quality bulk goods at competitive prices and razor-thin margins has built the company a loyal customer base.\n\nHowever, Costco's focus on offering the lowest possible prices does not necessarily apply to its stock. Thus, investors need to take a closer look at the company and its financials to know whether Costco will be an obvious buy in 2025.\n\nCostco's business\n\nFew can argue with the success of Costco. For the cost of a membership (which starts at $65 annually in the U.S.), customers have access to its warehouses, which offer a wide variety of desired goods.\n\nCostco competes by profiting from the membership fee. It then offers its goods primarily in bulk and sells them for little more than the cost of goods sold plus overhead. This strengthens Costco's competitive advantage as it can afford to sell goods at competitive prices.\n\nAdditionally, Costco has succeeded where retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) have failed -- expansion outside of North America. Approximately 30% of its nearly 900 warehouses are outside of the U.S., and its strategy of selling desired bulk goods has transcended the cultural challenges that often derailed the expansion plans of its competitors.\n\nSo successful is this approach that 93% of U.S. members and 90% of members globally renew memberships yearly. Also, despite the $5 per year membership price increase in September, Costco said it had an \"immaterial\" impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Nov. 24, 2024). Since membership fees are Costco's primary source of profit, this bodes well for its financials.\n\nInvesting in Costco by the numbers\n\nUnfortunately for prospective investors, Costco's success is a known quantity, and that has made the stock expensive by nearly every measure. That has not stopped investors from buying Costco stock. It currently sells near all-time highs, and in the last year alone, it rose by around 40%.\n\nNonetheless, this also means its valuation is also near all-time highs. The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio of 58, a level it has achieved at no other time in its history. That would presumably leave the stock with little upside and possibly significant downside if the sentiment were to turn negative.\n\nInvestors are probably right to question whether it justifies such a valuation. In fiscal Q1, revenue of $62 billion rose about 8%, which is higher than the 5% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1, 2024). Also, only $84 million of that Q1 2025 increase came from increased revenue from membership fees, meaning it had only a minimal impact on revenue.\n\nAlso, in fiscal Q1, that increase meant a higher cost of goods sold, and its selling, general, and administrative expenses surged by 9%. Additionally, Costco benefited from a modest drop in income tax expenses, translating into a quarterly net income of $1.8 billion. That was a 13% yearly rise, though it was also a slowdown from the 17% profit growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe question for investors is whether that increase justifies its valuation. While that amounts to a significant increase in profits, it may not support a premium price for this company's stock.\n\nShould I buy Costco stock in 2025?\n\nUnder current conditions, Costco stock is not a no-brainer for 2025. Indeed, Costco is one of the more successful companies in retailing, and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nHowever, even the most successful retail stocks are only worth so much. Despite the double-digit increase in its net income percentage, that does not appear to be enough to justify its 58 P/E ratio. That valuation could set Costco stock up for a steep decline if investors find the slightest imperfection in its earnings news.\n\nUltimately, with more potential downside than upside for its stock, investors are likely better off staying on the sidelines for now.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so\u2026 I want to help you find them.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently and 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter\u2019s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists.\n\nCramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump\u2019s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China\u2019s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion \"nonsense\" and \"idiocy.\" He added:\n\n\u201cNow, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they\u2019d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump\u2019s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

Although Costco\u2019s motto is \u2018do the right thing,\u2019 it appears that the company is doing the wrong thing\u2014clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal.\u201d\n\nThe letter cites a Supreme Court case, Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, and how the opinion stated, \u201cDistinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Attorney General Association (DAGA) accused Miyares of not having his priorities straight.\n\n\u201cMAGA Miyares continues to put politics before people,\u201d said Carolyn Fiddler, the communications director for DAGA. \u201cHis failure to call out the Trump administration for blatant violations of the law speaks to his proclivity for protecting Trump\u2019s agenda while putting Virginians\u2019 lives in danger. It\u2019s clear Miyares has no interest in the well-being of the Commonwealth and is instead focused on fighting meaningless culture wars.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Miyares urges Costco to end their DEI policies within 30 days or explain to his office why they haven\u2019t.\n\nMiyares is running for reelection to a second term this November.\n\nTwo Democrats, former Del. Jay Jones from Norfolk and Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor, are seeking the nomination to run against him.\n\n\u201cOn the very same day that the Trump administration announced an Executive Order recklessly freezing federal loan and grants funding, Jason Miyares was too busy serving as Trump\u2019s pro-bono attorney to fight to protect Virginians,\u201d Jones said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThis spending freeze has already forced half of Virginia\u2019s community health centers to pause operations, putting the health and paychecks of countless Virginia families at risk. Miyares is doing nothing to keep us safe, and Virginians deserve better.\u201d\n\nTaylor said she was not surprised by Miyares\u2019 decision to sign this letter.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed but not surprised that Attorney General Miyares is singling out a private company instead of protecting Virginia families,\u201d she said. \u201cMiyares\u2019 extreme allies are causing chaos, attempting to put thousands of Virginians out of work, and jeopardizing our privacy, financial security, and health care.\u201d\n\nTaylor also criticized him for remaining silent after President Trump pardoned individuals who were convicted for their actions on January 6.\n\n\u201cMiyares\u2019 silence on the pardons of people who violently assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6th shows Virginia that he will always place politics above our safety.\u201d\n\nMiyares did not provide a comment for this story.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nX\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "content": "The dream of going out for dinner at a restaurant on Valentine\u2019s Day is often shattered by the reality of actually dining out on the holiday. As a former waitress, I always dreaded Feb. 14. The restaurant was always overbooked. The wait staff did their best. Couples wanted to understandably linger at their table, gazing into each other's eyes, but management wanted waitstaff to turn tables as quickly as possible. Tips suffered.\n\nI know it\u2019s not that way at every restaurant, but it\u2019s that way at enough of them that I have stopped going out to dinner on Valentine\u2019s Day. Instead, I cook. I'll usually try to make something fancy for my partner and me on that night, even though he\u2019s always fine with whatever I make.\n\nIf simple, not fancy, is your speed for Valentine\u2019s Day, Costco has you covered this year. Just head to the refrigerated foods section.\n\nNuovo Heart-Shaped Ravioli Returns to Costco\n\nInstagram\u2019s @costcohype recently discovered the fan-favorite ready-to-cook Nuovo ravioli back on Costco's shelves. The adorable heart-shaped pasta is filled with ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, and aged Asiago cheeses. The package has two 16-ounce containers of the ravioli for $10.99, complete with a Valentine's Day (or Galentine\u2019s) recipe for pink Alfredo sauce.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's super delicious with every pasta sauce I use!!!!\u201d one commenter mentioned, which got me thinking. If I'm going to serve this specialty-shaped, cheese-filled pasta for Valentine\u2019s and wanted to make my own sauce, what would I make?\n\n\n\nI\u2019d probably choose tomato cream sauce made with canned tomatoes, seasoning, heavy cream, and butter because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and indulgence is allowed. Or maybe a pink vodka sauce. And if I wanted to add a little protein, a super flavorful sauce with ground beef may do the trick.\n\nBoiling heart-shaped ravioli for Valentine\u2019s Day may be a fun and easy choice, but choosing the sauce to put on them? That could be difficult. Still, I think these ravioli are the perfect, simple choice for someone who wants to make a special dinner for the ones they love on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n",

            "content": "Almost a year after Costco Wholesale\u2019s long-time finance chief stepped down from the CFO post he held for roughly four decades, Richard Galanti has retired and left the company: He clocked his final official workday on Thursday.\n\nIt\u2019s been something of a long, bittersweet goodbye. As planned, since March Galanti has served in an advisory role after handing the finance reins to his successor, Costco\u2019s current CFO Gary Millerchip. Galanti has also served as executive vice president and a member of the company\u2019s board of directors, according to a securities filing. He attended his last annual meeting in January.\n\nBut old habits are hard to break. Galanti was back in the Issaquah, Washington-based company\u2019s offices Tuesday, collecting a few personal things he\u2019d left behind. \u201cHe\u2019s still here today cleaning out his desk,\u201d said David Sherwood, vice president, financial planning and investor relations at Costco. Sherwood described Galanti as an executive who was steeped in the company\u2019s culture and a \u201ctough to replace\u201d steward of the company, who is \u201ceverybody\u2019s friend.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with his nickname as the \u201cvoice\u201d of Costco to Wall Street, who is known for his ability to tease out the stories and trends behind the company\u2019s numbers, Galanti called CFO Dive Tuesday from his car to tell his parting tale. \u201cI went to grab a couple pictures off the wall,\u201d along with some other personal knick-knacks he\u2019d left behind in his old office, he said, noting that he wasn\u2019t returning on official business.\n\nLooking back, he expressed gratitude for having had the opportunity to be part of the retailer\u2019s growth trajectory. Costco had 896 warehouses as of Nov. 24, according to its latest quarterly report. Galanti first cut his retail teeth working in his family\u2019s Atlanta grocery business, CFO Dive previously reported. He joined the warehouse club retailer back in 1984 when it was just opening its first three locations in the Pacific Northwest and he was just two weeks shy of his 28th birthday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Galanti also shared some of his thoughts on succession planning, his future, and what he will miss. In terms of an ideal time period for a typical executive transition, Galanti said he\u2019d advise about two to three months. In the case of Millerchip, an experienced finance executive and former CFO of Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocer Kroger, his successor was \u201cgood to go from the beginning.\u201d Galanti said his decision to stay through the year was not related to the time needed to help Millerchip transition into the CFO role.\n\nAsked what Galanti will miss at the company, he first noted that \u201cfirst and foremost, that will be the people.\u201d He said he\u2019d also miss being the company\u2019s \u201cvoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly you miss being in the game,\u201d he said, noting that he has plans to put his business experience to use on corporate boards. Looking ahead, Galanti said he also has plans to spend more time with family and travel.\n\nThere is one thing that he hasn\u2019t loved, and that is the increased regulations that public companies must grapple with. \u201cI won\u2019t miss the ongoing increasing complexity of running a business,\u201d he said, noting that he has always joked about the rising number of acronyms that are now part of retail which is, at its heart, a very simple business. \u201cYou buy stuff and you sell stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past year, Galanti\u2019s departure has been well-feted. There have been numerous celebrations, Sherwood recalled in an interview Tuesday. Galanti also was honored in other ways, including with a lifetime achievement award from the CFO Leadership Council, which noted that Costco has become a \u201cglobal powerhouse\u201d under his leadership.\n\nAmong the public farewells, there was one notably heartfelt exchange that pierced the routine earnings protocol during the final call hosted by Galanti last year. \u201cI feel like we should be, like raising your jersey to the rafters like a superstar is retiring here,\u201d said one analyst, according to a transcript of the March 7, 2024 call. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d",

Shoppers came prepared to make the most of the bounty \u2014 the likes of which they may not see again for a long time.\n\nContrary to the saying, more than a few shoppers thought it was wise to put all of their eggs into one basket.\n\nSalgado stocked up so she could scramble eggs or mix them with cottage cheese for a protein-rich meal as part of her workout routine.\n\nGet our editors\u2019 top restaurant picks, access to tough reservations, heads-up on new pop-ups, and more in our Off Menu weekly newsletter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a family at home, so we go through a lot of eggs,\u201d he told The Standard.\n\nRoger Pincombe of San Francisco was buying two lots of two dozen. He comes to Costco every three weeks to replenish because the prices, he says, are about three times less than at other markets.\n\nThe refrigerators where the kitchen staples were kept were the scene of a persistent shopping-cart traffic jam through the morning.\n\nAs the store opened, customers could purchase unlimited eggs. The Standard saw one woman load 14 of the five-dozen cartons into her cart.\n\nCustomers swarmed around the medium, free-range 18-count (USDA grade A) for $6.29 a pack; the organic, large, pasture-raised two-dozen packs for $8.69; and the Kirkland-signature cage-free, large two-dozen packs for $7.69.\n\nShoppers said it\u2019s been difficult to get eggs at other supermarkets as bird flu has wreaked havoc on poultry farms.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed highly pathogenic avian flu in a commercial flock for the first time on Feb. 8, 2022, three years ago this week. According to government data, as of Monday, there have been four affected commercial flocks and two affected backyard flocks in California and a total of 387,710 birds affected in this outbreak.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to get eggs at Safeway,\u201d said Daniel Talton, a city resident and cook at Lord Stanley on Polk Street. He paused with his brother Bubba to collect themselves after yoking a personal supply.\n\nA woman buying for Carmelina\u2019s Cafe in the Mission, who declined to give her name, said she saved money for the restaurant by purchasing eight five-dozen cartons at $17.99 each. That comes to $143.92 at Costco, versus approximately $300 from her usual source, she said. The stash would last the cafe about two weeks, she said.",

O\u2019Brien said in the statement. \u201cFrom Day One, we\u2019ve told Costco that our members won\u2019t work a day past January 31 without a historic, industry-leading agreement.\u201d\n\nPrior to the vote, which 85% of members supported, workers organized practice pickets across the country, including actions last week in Hayward, California; Sumner, Washington; and Long Island, New York.\n\nWhile Costco is known for paying its employees higher wages than its competitors, the union is accusing the company of not sharing its recent success with workers.\n\n\u201cCostco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it\u2019s failing to live up to that reputation,\u201d Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said.\n\nCostco recently reported that net sales in December were up 9.9% from the year before.\n\nBusiness as usual: In an earnings call last month, Costco President and CEO Ron Vachris told shareholders that the company is focused on a \u201cfair and timely process for getting to an agreement with the Teamsters,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cwe have a 40-year track record of dealing fairly with the Teamsters union, and really nothing has changed about that.\u201d\n\nThe Teamsters have lately shown themselves willing to take on some of the biggest retailers. At the peak of the holiday season in December, the union authorized a strike of Amazon that lasted until December 24. Workers formed picket lines at hundreds of fulfillment centers, but went on strike at just nine locations.\n\nWhile Amazon doesn\u2019t usually acknowledge the union, the Teamsters claim to represent nearly 10,000 workers at the e-commerce giant.\n\nThis report was originally published by Retail Brew.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "Buying items in bulk can significantly lower the price per item. As an example, a 24-pack of Charmin Mega XL Ultra Soft toilet paper retails for $39.99 at Target ($1.66 per roll), while a 30-pack of Charmin Ultra Soft costs $33.99 at Costco ($1.13 per roll). That's a savings of more than 50 cents per roll when you purchase from Costco. These prices may vary slightly based on location, but you'll likely find a similar price difference between Costco and non-warehouse retailers.\n\nThe problem, however, is that buying items in bulk sometimes requires a larger investment upfront, which isn't always within the monthly grocery budget. Sure, buying 5 pounds of Kirkland Mexican Style Blend Cheese for $17 at Costco is 16 cents cheaper per ounce compared to an 8-ounce bag of Kraft Mexican Style Four Cheese Blend Shredded Cheese for $2.98 from Walmart. However, you would have to pay $17 for cheese up front. Plus, if you don't go through a specific product quickly enough, it could sit on the shelf collecting dust \u2014 or even expire before you get to use it.\n\nFortunately, there is a way to avoid these potential pitfalls while still taking advantage of the bulk pricing available when shopping at Costco. Coordinate with a friend or neighbor who could also benefit from the lower cost and split the item with them. This way, you can each get the benefits without forking out a big sum or having too much of any one item on hand.",

Straight Arrow News\n\nRetail wholesale giant Costco announced pay increases for all employees at its non-union stores to push most of its hourly U.S. workers over $30 an hour, according to a memo obtained by Reuters, ahead of a now-averted nationwide strike by Costco Teamsters.\n\nCostco will increase pay for non-union employees at the top of Costco's pay scale by $1 to $30.20 an hour the first year, with an additional $1 increase for each of the subsequent two years. Non-union employees at the lower end of the pay scale will see an increase of 50 cents, the memo said, bringing their pay to $20 an hour.\n\nAdditional benefits will also be added, including an extra week of vacation after 30 years and vacation time for workers in their first year, according to Forbes.\n\n\"With these changes, we believe our hourly wages and benefits will continue to far outpace others in the retail industry,\" the memo said.\n\nThe increases are for non-union workers. The more than 18,000 workers at about 50 of the chain's 624 U.S. union shops will not receive the same pay raise and benefits. Any changes for them will require a new contract to replace the previous one, which expired on Jan. 31, 2025.\n\nCostco's announcement was made a day before union members were set to go on a nationwide strike. The Teamsters labor union stated on Saturday that its negotiating committee had come to a tentative agreement for a new contract, Reuters reported. Details have not yet been released, pending a vote by the membership.\n\nWhen does the Costco pay increase begin?\n\nSpecific dates were not included in the memo.\n\nTeamsters spokesperson Matthew McQuaid said the pay increase was due to the pressure being put on by the union.\n\n\"Don\u2019t be fooled by Costco\u2019s fake generosity. This is not a worker-friendly company \u2014 it's a company that\u2019s terrified of worker power,\" McQuaid said. \"There are still 18,000 unionized workers who know their worth and are demanding it.\"\n\nHow much does Costco pay?\n\nCostco is one of the highest-paying employers in retail. In July, Costco CEO Ron Vachris announced that starting pay and highest pay for service assistants, service clerks, and meat cutters would increase by $1 an hour, bringing the starting wage to $19.50 an hour.\n\n50-cent increases for other employees, determined by seniority, were applied to nearly all hourly employees last summer, bringing the top scale of clerks to $30.90 an hour. This followed a raise of 50 cents an hour in March 2024 and two previous pay hikes in 2021, according to Business Insider.\n\nMedian hourly pay for a retail sales worker in the U.S. (meaning half of the sales workers make more and half of them make less) was $16.30 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWhat is the minimum wage in California?\n\nEffective Jan. 1, minimum wage workers in California will earn $16.50 instead of $16. The rates have been adjusted annually for inflation. California voters narrowly voted against a proposition to raise the state minimum wage to $18,\n\nThe minimum wage is already above $16.50 for workers in specific industries or certain California places. For example, in April, fast-food workers saw their minimum wage increase to $20 an hour. Los Angeles's minimum wage is $17.28, joining dozens of other localities with minimum wages higher than the state\u2019s.\n\nCostco defies pressure to drop DEI program\n\nTrump calls for end to DEI programs President Donald Trump is calling for an end to federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. Fox - Seattle\n\nIn January, Costco became one of the few major companies to resist pressure to drop its DEI programs, which, according to its inclusion goals, \"empower our workforce and strengthen our culture by creating an environment where all employees feel a sense of belonging\u2014that they are accepted, included, respected and valued for who they are. \" Costco shareholders voted down an investor proposal from a conservative think tank that urged management to investigate the business risks of its diversity initiatives.\n\nAccording to preliminary results announced by Costco chairman Hamilton \u201cTony\u201d James, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.\n\n\"We owe our success to the more than 300,000 employees who serve our members every day. It is important that they all feel included and appreciated and that they transmit these values to our customers,\" James said.\n\nAfter the vote, more than 19 Republican state attorneys general wrote to Costco demanding that they repeal their DEI policies, in accordance with President Donald Trump's executive order encouraging \u201cthe Private Sector to End Illegal DEI discrimination and Preferences\u201d or explain why they have not. Costco has not yet responded.\n\nSince Trump took office, several major companies, including Amazon, Meta, Walmart, Nissan, and Target, have publicly dropped their diversity initiatives.\n\nWhere can I find a Costco near me in California?\n\nAccording to Costco's website, there are 140 stores in California. San Jose has six Costcos, the most of any city in California. Wyoming, West Virginia, and Rhode Island are the states without Costco locations. In total, Costco has 614 stores in the United States.",

Nearly 98% of shareholders voted against the measure. Costco\u2019s board had recommended rejection of the proposal.\n\nAt the Jan. 24 shareholders meeting, Costco board chair Tony E. Curtis said the company\u2019s commitment to inclusion \u201cdoes not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit. The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals.\u201d\n\nCostco has not publicly responded to the letter. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday, Jan. 29.\n\nCostco\u2019s North Dakota stores are in Bismarck and West Fargo, according to its website.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\n\n\n\nNationwide, some companies are rethinking their commitment to DEI, while others are standing by their diversity practices. Brands like Walmart and Meta have rolled back DEI policies while tech giants Microsoft and Apple reaffirmed their policies within the last week.\n\nDEI policies are often aimed at removing bias and promoting fairness in areas like employment and education.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis story was originally published on NorthDakotaMonitor.com",

He spent 29 years at Costco and is fiercely defensive of it as the grocery chain faces an onslaught of attacks for its refusal to jettison its DEI initiatives.\n\nThe former executive claims that Costco has always valued the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion, even before the term \"DEI\" existed. Costco executives see the company\u2019s culture as a key factor in its success and that, to his ears, DEI is synonymous with the way the company has always done business.\n\nWhile Campbell emphasized he does not speak for the company or any current executive or board member, he feels the reason Costco has been stalwart in defense of its DEI policies is because the board sees attacks on them as attacks on the business itself.\n\nCOSTCO SHOPPERS RESPOND AS COMPANY'S DEI PRACTICES FALL UNDER SCRUTINY\n\n\"Our whole idea was taking care of the employee. Our whole idea was a very simple thing \u2014 if you hire good people, pay them good wages and give them good benefits, then likely good things are going to happen,\" Campbell said.\n\nCostco board members recently shot down a shareholder proposal to analyze the risks of its DEI policies. In response, 19 states\u2019 attorneys general issued a letter to Costco CEO Ron Vachris demanding the company drop their DEI programs to conform with President Trump\u2019s recent executive order banning DEI from the federal government.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order comes in the wake of numerous companies announcing that they\u2019re terminating their DEI initiatives following intense public backlash, with Facebook, McDonald\u2019s, Boeing, Harley-Davidson and others all rolling back or outright nixing the programs.\n\nBut Costco, unlike other companies, has the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion hardwired into its DNA, Campbell claims, and feels no need to drop the programs despite the fact that they are no longer politically fashionable.\n\n\"It was the rules at some point in time. Somebody said \u2018okay everybody has to get into DEI\u2019 and you saw all these companies get into it and then get out of it because they never had one to start with,\" Campbell claims, \"Call it what you want to call it, but we had something that worked.\"\n\n\n\nO'LEARY RIPS COSTCO FOR BUCKING DEI TREND: 'BAD FOR BUSINESS'\n\nCampbell said that when it came to hiring, Costco always sought to ensure the employees at their warehouses and stores reflected the communities they were located in demographically. He says that Costco had no trouble achieving this goal, and never had to consciously alter its hiring practices to meet a certain quota.\n\n\"Diversity was a word that was used, but it was never \u2018My gosh, we need to get a program. We need to train diversity.\u2019\"\n\nCostco based its promotions on merit, not race or gender, Campbell claimed, adding that he had never heard anyone complaining they lost an opportunity because they were a White man. However, he conceded that when he decided on promotions he would take race into account if both candidates were \"equally qualified\" for the job.\n\n\"If I absolutely was looking at a promotion, and there were two people where either one of those two could do this job, I think, internally, there could be a couple times where I said, \u2018you know what, I need to give this diverse person an opportunity instead of holding them back,\u2019\" Campbell admitted.\n\nCOSTCO, TEAMSTERS, REACH 'TENTATIVE AGREEMENT' LIKELY AVERTING STRIKE AS COMPANY'S DEI CONTROVERSY RAGES ON\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS\n\nCostco introduced its formal DEI initiatives as Campbell was leaving the company, but in practice he had not observed nor heard of any changes to the company\u2019s core values.\n\n\"[The board is] associating DEI with the history of our company,\" he said. \"If it's in our books or its in our program it\u2019s just because it existed. We just never called it DEI, we just always thought of it as our culture.\"\n\nCostco, which is facing a potential strike from unionized employees in some of its stores, has always had a pro-worker image. The grocery chain lays claim to an 8% turnover rate according to Harvard Business Review, and its average hourly rate is reportedly $31.\n\nThe grocery club\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Hamilton E. James, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic-aligned PACs in the last election cycle, with several other board members following suit.\n\nCampbell, who identifies as a conservative, rejects the idea that the board forces its politics on the business.\n\nThough Campbell maintains that Costco\u2019s commitment to diversity has been longstanding, it has not seemed to translate to the highest ranks within the company. Of its top managers, 72% are men and 81% White, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\"We need more diversity at the top levels,\" Campbell conceded.",

            "content": "Costco workers: Tell us what you think about the cancellation of the strike! All submissions will be kept anonymous.\n\nCostco Wholesale in Burbank, California\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, February 1, the Teamsters bureaucracy announced a tentative agreement to block a strike by 18,000 Costco workers. This deal was negotiated behind closed doors and is still concealed from the membership.\n\nCostco, with its 219,000 US employees and 617 stores nationwide, has only 56 locations where workers are unionized. Nonetheless, a strike would have raised the potential for united struggle among union and non-union workers, demonstrating the power of collective action.\n\nGiven the explosive political environment in the United States, it also raised the potential for a confrontation by the working class against the Trump administration, whose attacks on immigrants immediately endanger the status of many immigrant workers at Costco, along with implications that threaten the democratic rights of all.\n\nInstead, Teamsters officials made no real preparations for a strike, as reported by rank-and-file members across various locals. From the beginning, it was evident that the union leadership\u2019s primary goal was to avoid any disruption to Costco\u2019s operations rather than to fight for workers\u2019 demands.\n\nIn this, the Teamsters are recycling their tactics at UPS in 2023, where they used a bogus \u201cstrike ready\u201d campaign as a smokescreen to spring a deal on workers at the last minute. That contract, sold to workers as a victory produced by a \u201ccredible strike threat,\u201d has since been followed by tens of thousands of layoffs at UPS.\n\nAbove all, the bureaucracy was determined to block a strike which could have intersected with the rapidly expanding protests against the Trump administration. Teamsters General President Sean O\u2019Brien is a top ally of Trump, and many other union officials have backed his \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism and declared their willingness to \u201cwork\u201d with him.\n\nIn a statement prepared in advance of what would have been the largest US strike this year, the World Socialist Web Site wrote:\n\nImmigrants are not \u201ccriminals\u201d responsible for taking \u201cAmerican\u201d jobs, as Trump claims, but our fellow workers and brothers and sisters. No doubt, thousands of immigrant workers are taking part in the Costco strike, and when nonunion Costco workers are included, tens of thousands work at this one company. ...Trump claims that \u201cAmerica First\u201d will save American jobs. The reality is that the working class, both foreign and \u201cnative\u201d born, are his primary target, as in every dictatorship in history. His government is of, by and for the oligarchy, backed by billionaires and even outright fascists like Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cThe defense of the rights of workers requires a fight against the union bureaucrats,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAs far as Trump\u2019s plan for dictatorship is concerned,\u201d the WSWS explained, \u201cthe bureaucracy\u2019s only concern is that it gets a \u2018seat at the table\u2019 in the new regime, no matter what happens to workers.\u201d\n\nThe statement concluded:\n\n[The struggle of Costco workers] requires transferring power from the union apparatus to rank-and-file committees, made up of the most trusted workers and excluding officials. These committees must be based on a strategy of 1) the absolute, democratic authority of the rank and file, not career officials, and 2) the unity of workers of all races, nationalities and ethnicities. Those in the Teamsters hierarchy who promote fascism and \u201cAmerica First\u201d racism must be called to account. There is no reason that workers should continue to finance these peoples\u2019 six-figure salaries with their dues money.\n\nDetails hidden from workers\n\nThe most glaring aspect of the Costco agreement is the absolute secrecy surrounding its terms. Workers have not been given any details, a clear indication that the deal falls far short of what is necessary to keep up with the soaring cost of living.\n\nGiven that inflation continues to erode wages nationwide, any agreement that does not include substantial increases in real pay and benefits is an outright betrayal. The silence from Teamsters leadership reveals its bad faith and only confirms that the deal is woefully inadequate. Otherwise, they would be shouting the details from the rooftops.\n\nThe WSWS spoke to Costco workers at various locations in Los Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego. Many were upset to learn the strike they voted for was called off at the eleventh hour around 2:27 in the morning via a post on X/Twitter. Workers said they still were in the dark about details.\n\nAt some locations, WSWS reporters learned that truck drivers called out of work Saturday to protest the cancellation of the strike.\n\nTony said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been told anything about the contract. I\u2019m able to get a pension because I\u2019ve worked [decades] for Costco. But a lot of these young people will never see that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing the union gave up the last time was Kin Care, where you can get days off to take care of a sick child or family member. That\u2019s very hard on everyone. Many of the younger workers are starting to have families and kids get sick. They need to take time off. They\u2019re finding out how difficult it is because that\u2019s not available to them. We still have to vote on this contract. But in the end we have to find out what we have to do to fight the whole system.\u201d\n\nOne young worker who helps gather the shopping carts at the Signal Hill store said the country \u201clooks like an oligarchy right now. Trump has Elon next to him, and they have so much power. He has a billionaire on his side. It\u2019s like a second president.\u201d\n\nA recently hired worker gathering the shopping carts said, \u201cI\u2019m not too familiar with all the reasons behind the strike. But the Teamsters endorsing, promoting Trump? I mean, I\u2019m critical of both sides always, the Democrats and Republicans ... [but] Trump is a whole entity entirely, and I don\u2019t support anything he has going on at all. It\u2019s objectively immoral in all ways.\u201d\n\nThomas has been working at Costco in San Diego for over 10 years. He told reporters \u201cI think you\u2019re right, they never intended to strike. They never told us what the plan was, didn\u2019t warn the customers, did not send out information about what to expect.\u201d Workers have been forced to give up concessions on sick days in previous contracts. \u201cEssentially sick time went from 30 days to 12 days, now why the Teamsters accepted that is a good question. I\u2019d say the contracts keep getting worse. What are the Teamsters doing other than collecting our money?\u201d\n\nJuan, a food service employee said, \u201cWe had no information and what bothered me was that there was never anything in writing. Everything was word of mouth from the steward and nothing was clear. The union was asking for a $10 dollar raise, $5 in the first year. Then when they told us Costco was only offering $1 an hour raise each year, that is not even meeting us in the middle and tells me they don\u2019t really care about negotiating.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Alvin told WSWS reporters Costco was discussing increased surveillance on workers and that this was a major issue in the next contract. \u201cWhat do you need to watch me for? I don\u2019t steal, I don\u2019t get it, that\u2019s overboard and I don\u2019t agree with that attack on my privacy.\u201d\n\nAlvin added that both his father and grandfather were auto workers, who retired with pensions. He said that the situation for what workers in his generation face is far worse. \u201cAll that is gone now. They\u2019ve tried to replace those types of unions with, you know, these types of unions and situations.\u201d\n\nMichael, who has been working at Costco for over ten years, told reporters: \u201cThis is actually the first time I\u2019m hearing of an agreement that was reached. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that my rent is due to go up in May and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to afford to stay where I currently live. I\u2019m praying that the negotiations go well and that we do see a substantial wage increase to account for that increase in cost of living. But I\u2019m not optimistic, I\u2019m doubtful that whatever they do agree to is going to be enough to compensate for the cost of living increases.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI know that a lot of people like to paint Trump as the political outsider ... But I don\u2019t think that you can be a billionaire and claim to be a pro-worker. I think that he has made a career out of exploiting the working class, minorities and immigrants. A very carefully crafted public persona and campaign he ran has duped a lot of working class people into thinking that he will be better for them when I think that it\u2019s pretty fair to say that that\u2019s not the case and he\u2019s already showing why.\u201d\n\n\u201c[But] the Democrats\u2019 attitudes towards the war in Gaza feels very similar to that of the Republicans, and that feels again like a continuation of the status quo...Pretty much, to me, I believe that the Democratic Party is centrist at best in economic issues and only really left leaning when it comes to identity politics. And that, I believe, is one of the largest contributors to why they lost. I think that the majority of people are a little bit tired of identity politics... To me the Democrats and the Republicans feel like two heads of the same beast, two sides of the same coin.\u201d",

Straight Arrow News\n\nRetail wholesale giant Costco announced pay increases for all employees at its non-union stores to push most of its hourly U.S. workers over $30 an hour, according to a memo obtained by Reuters, ahead of a planned nationwide strike by Costco Teamsters.\n\nCostco will increase pay for non-union employees at the top of Costco's pay scale by $1 to $30.20 an hour the first year, with an additional $1 increase for each of the subsequent two years. Non-union employees at the lower end of the pay scale will see an increase of 50 cents, the memo said, bringing their pay to $20 an hour.\n\nAdditional benefits will also be added, including an extra week of vacation after 30 years and vacation time for workers in their first year, according to Forbes.\n\n\"With these changes, we believe our hourly wages and benefits will continue to far outpace others in the retail industry,\" the memo said.\n\nThe increases are for non-union workers. The more than 18,000 workers at about 50 of the chain's 624 U.S. locations that are union shops will not receive the same pay raise and benefits. Any changes for them will come with a new contract to replace the previous one that expired Jan. 31, 2025.\n\nCostco's announcement was released a day before union members were about to go on a nationwide strike. The Teamsters labor union said on Saturday that its negotiating committee had reached a tentative agreement for a new contract, Reuters reported. Details have not yet been released, pending a vote by the membership.\n\nWhen does the Costco pay increase begin?\n\nSpecific dates were not included in the memo.\n\nTeamsters spokesperson Matthew McQuaid said the pay increase was due to the pressure being put on by the union.\n\n\"Don\u2019t be fooled by Costco\u2019s fake generosity. This is not a worker-friendly company \u2014 it's a company that\u2019s terrified of worker power,\" McQuaid said. \"There are still 18,000 unionized workers who know their worth and are demanding it.\"\n\nHow much does Costco pay?\n\nCostco is one of the highest-paying employers in retail. In July, Costco CEO Ron Vachris announced that starting pay and highest pay for service assistants, service clerks, and meat cutters would increase by $1 an hour, bringing the starting wage to $19.50 an hour.\n\n50-cent increases for other employees, determined by seniority, were applied to nearly all hourly employees last summer, bringing the top scale of clerks to $30.90 an hour. This followed a raise of 50 cents an hour in March 2024 and two previous pay hikes in 2021, according to Business Insider.\n\nMedian hourly pay for a retail sales worker in the U.S. (meaning half of the sales workers make more and half of them make less) was $16.30 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWhat is the minimum wage in Florida?\n\nThe minimum hourly wage in Florida is currently $13 an hour for non-tipped employees and $9.98 for tipped employees, thanks to the amendment Floridians approved in 2020 to raise the wage incrementally until it reaches $15 an hour for non-tipped employees in 2026.\n\nThe minimum wage will rise by another $1 on September 30, 2025.\n\nCostco defies pressure to drop DEI program\n\nTrump calls for end to DEI programs President Donald Trump is calling for an end to federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs. Fox - Seattle\n\nIn January, Costco became one of the few major companies to resist pressure to drop their DEI programs that \"empower our workforce and strengthen our culture by creating an environment where all employees feel a sense of belonging \u2014 that they are accepted, included, respected and valued for who they are,\" according to Costo's Inclusion goals. Costco shareholders voted down an investor proposal from a conservative think tank that urged management to investigate the business risks of its diversity initiatives.\n\nMore than 98% of shares voted against the proposal, according to preliminary results announced by Costco chairman Hamilton \u201cTony\u201d James.\n\n\"We owe our success to the more than 300,000 employees who serve our members every day. It is important that they all feel included and appreciated and that they transmit these values to our customers,\" James said.\n\nAfter the vote, more than 19 Republican state attorneys general wrote to Costco demanding that they repeal their DEI policies, in accordance with President Donald Trump's executive order encouraging \u201cthe Private Sector to End Illegal DEI discrimination and Preferences\u201d or explain why they have not. Costco has not yet responded.\n\nSince Trump took office, several major companies have publicly dropped their diversity initiatives, including Amazon, Meta, Walmart, Nissan and Target.\n\nWhere can I find a Costco near me in Florida?\n\nThere are 33 Costco warehouses in Florida.

            "content": "Quick Take Lookout columnist Claudia Sternbach broke down in tears while getting hearing aids last week. Here, she gently unpacks the moment and reminds us of the loneliness of living as a widow. Her husband died 11 months ago and she has been chronicling her journey.\n\nHave something to say? Lookout welcomes letters to the editor, within our policies, from readers. Guidelines here.\n\nI will admit I was totally embarrassed. There I was, sitting in a small, quiet room having my hearing tested, while just outside the door was the hustle and bustle of Santa Cruz Costco. Carts filled with laundry detergent and diapers, pot pies and wine pushed up and down the aisles by shoppers of all ages.\n\nThe noise levels \u201cout there\u201d were high and jarring, and the quiet in the small exam room was a welcome contrast. But something triggered me and I began to cry. Not an ugly cry, but more of a delicate cry, tears escaping from my eyes and sliding down my cheeks like small rivers. I tried to wipe them with the back of my hand, but they just kept coming.\n\nThis was a first. Acquiring hearing aids is part of getting older. Part of the adventure. But, never have I gotten emotional during an exam.\n\nI have been wearing devices to assist in hearing for several years. I am not self-conscious about them. I was more self-conscious about not hearing voices when people were speaking to me, especially my grandson.\n\nLately, however, my old hearing aids were not cutting it. I knew it was time for an upgrade, so here we were. Me in a chair holding a beeper like the ones used on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and listening to the different sounds through the headphones placed on my head and pushing a button each time I could detect the beep. The technician monitored the sounds, and there we sat in the small room together, working as a team to figure out just how much my hearing had changed and how to program the new pair of aids when they arrived.\n\nMORE FROM CLAUDIA STERNBACH My daughter and grandson had to evacuate during the L.A. fires \u2013 we are all one when it comes to worrying about fire risk\n\nAs we completed the testing, the gentleman performing the evaluation picked up one of my hearing aids and gently brushed my hair away from my face so he could place the small object back in my ear. Then he did the same on the other side. Then I began to cry.\n\nI apologized quickly, but he assured me it was no problem. He looked concerned, but did not panic at a 74-year-old woman having what might be a small nervous breakdown.\n\nHe just sat quietly and listened as I told him that my husband had died and that this week would have been his birthday and that I was trying to figure out what had caused me to weep. He again told me not to worry. Not to be concerned. And he looked me in the eye and smiled.\n\nThe technician stepped out for a moment, and when he returned and sat down opposite me I attempted to explain what had happened. I realized what had triggered me. It was his eye contact, his gentle, caring touch.\n\nIt was like a balm. I had not been aware of how much I have missed feeling the physical, human connection. Not in a sexual way, not at all. But in a soothing, comforting way.\n\nHe listened quietly as I told him that I would imagine that most of his clients are older and that many of them may be living their lives without a partner. That many of them, while having hobbies and friends and social activities and trying to stay healthy and making sure they are up to date with their hearing needs, may be living without much in the way of physical contact. I told him that I would imagine his caring touch was welcome.\n\nHe said that made his day.\n\nDriving home, I thought about a study I had read years ago where baby monkeys were separated from their mothers. In the 1950s and 1960s, psychologist Harry Harlow created a controversial experiment to monitor how the small creatures developed if they had no maternal care. They were not held or comforted as they grew older. Deprived of physical contact, they suffered.\n\nPerhaps it is the same for older folks. Perhaps we are not that different from those little monkeys. We are social creatures who take comfort in small gestures. A hand on a shoulder. A pat on the back. Eye contact. To remind us we are still a part of the human family.",

I\u2019ve learned how to avoid impulse buys and stick to the products Costco sells at competitive prices.\n\nUsually bulk-buying means paying more upfront, but I\u2019ve found a dependable item in Costco\u2019s produce department that allows me to stock up without breaking the bank. There might not be a better deal in the entire warehouse than Costco\u2019s three-pound bunches of Del Monte bananas. That\u2019s just one reason why I buy them every \u2014 yes, every \u2014 week.\n\nCredit: Patty Catalano Credit: Patty Catalano\n\nWhat\u2019s So Great About Del Monte Bananas?\n\nIt comes down to cost and convenience. These bananas are sold in three-pound bunches for just $1.49. The number and size of the bananas in each bundle varies, but I usually find it contains at least eight medium bananas. That breaks down to just 19 cents per banana. (Trader Joe\u2019s famously used to sell bananas for the same price, but increased it in 2024 to 23 cents per banana.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostco\u2019s bananas are often sold slightly less ripe than those displayed at other grocers. For me, that\u2019s a win; I prefer a slightly underripe banana for eating out of hand, so that gives me plenty of time to enjoy the fruit as it is before they\u2019re too soft.\n\nWith so many bananas in the bunch, it\u2019s easy to designate a few for eating straight from the peel and others for breakfast, snack, and dessert recipes throughout the week. (One thing that I don\u2019t worry about is how to store the bananas or what to do with them once they\u2019re past their prime, because The Kitchn has done the research already.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Way to Enjoy Del Monte Bananas?\n\nIf you love to start the day with bananas as much as I do, the possibilities are practically endless. Peanut butter and banana is one of my favorite flavor combinations, so I\u2019ll often make these peanut butter, banana, and granola wraps for breakfast or as an afternoon snack. Other ways to enjoy this flavor combination are in a peanut butter and banana smoothie, warm bowl of oatmeal, or as a sheet cake with waves of peanut butter icing.\n\nTwo-ingredient pancakes are quick and easy to make when you have a bunch of bananas on hand, or try these banana bread pancakes that are buttery and full of banana flavor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThick slices of banana bread are also a welcome start to the day. The only trouble is deciding which recipe to make. There\u2019s the classic banana bread loaf, one studded with chocolate chips, a recipe for pumpkin banana bread, and another for nut-lovers.\n\nBananas aren\u2019t just for the morning \u2014 they\u2019re just as delicious for dessert. Serve banana pudding in a tall trifle dish or lovingly layered into bars. Bake a banana cake with cream cheese frosting for your next event or make a showstopping dessert like bananas Foster. And don\u2019t forget that bananas are the star ingredient of the classic ice cream treat, the banana split. In the unlikely event that you need to stash a lingering banana in the freezer, here\u2019s the best way to freeze the fruit for later.\n\nFind it in stores: Del Monte Bananas, $1.49 for 3 pounds\n\nWhat Costco produce do you buy on repeat?

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA threatened strike at 56 Costco stores across six states has been averted for now, as the company and negotiators for the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, reached an 11th hour tentative agreement, the union told CNN early Saturday morning.\n\nFull terms of the deal were not immediately available. Costco did not respond a request for comment. The strike would have been the largest ever at an American retail chain, and the first ever at the big box retailer.\n\nBeyond wages and benefits, the union also had demands regarding seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nThe agreement, announced several hours after the contract expired at 11:59pm PT Friday, does not completely end the threat of a strike. It would still need to be ratified by rank-and-file members of the union at Costco before it goes into effect. Last fall, unionized workers at Boeing voted down a tentative deal its union leadership had reached with the aircraft maker and started a strike that lasted two months. But most tentative deals do result in a final contract.\n\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of its 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would behave been significant for the largely non-union sector of the economy. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers work in grocery stores.\n\nThe specific locations of the unionized stores have not been identified by either the union or company. But the union said they are in six states along the East and West Coasts \u2013 Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Virginia as well as California and Washington state, the latter being Costco\u2019s corporate home. Costco had said on Friday that even if its unionized workers had gone on strike, \u201call of our locations will be open for business this weekend,\u201d an indication that it intended to use management and non-union staff to keep stores operating.\n\nAnd even though the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, it was prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of non-union Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remained on the job. Such a move could have greatly increased the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for other picket lines.\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that \u201cour philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.\u201d\n\nCostco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at non-union stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour, to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\n\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco\u2019s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion \u2014 up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco\u2019s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: \u201cPro worker? Prove it!\u201d and \u201cRecord profits = record contract.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn\u2019t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are officially drivers for third-party delivery services despite exclusively delivering packages for the online retailer, are its employees.\n\nThis is a developing story. It will be updated.",

Citing Costco\u2019s surging profits, which hit $7.4bn last year, the union has called for significant wage increases and improvements to benefits.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, we\u2019ve told Costco that our members won\u2019t work a day past January 31 without a historic, industry-leading agreement,\u201d said the Teamsters general president, Sean O\u2019Brien, in a statement.\n\nIn January the Teamsters announced that members had voted 85% in favor of a strike, with the union holding practice pickets and rallying outside Costco\u2019s headquarters in Washington during the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\n\nThe union said their questions submitted to the shareholder meeting went unanswered, accusing the company\u2019s negotiators of \u201cnickel and diming\u201d workers at the bargaining table while the company\u2019s board has approved \u201coutrageous\u201d salaries for corporate executives.

Workers on the bottom of the wage scale will receive a $0.50 increase to $20 an hour.\n\nAs several large corporations have rescinded their diversity, equity and inclusion policies as Trump has taken office, including Walmart, McDonald\u2019s and Target, Costco has defended its DEI policies.

Puskar/AP\n\nCostco is raising pay \u2014 above $30 an hour for many workers \u2014 as the deadline looms for the company to reach a new contract with its unionized employees.\n\nThe powerful International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents about 18,000 Costco employees, or roughly 8% of the company's U.S. workers. The union's current collective-bargaining contract expires at the end of Friday, and the union members have voted to authorize a strike if negotiations fail.\n\nNow Costco CEO Ron Vachris has announced pay increases for nonunionized workers over the next three years, according to an internal memo viewed by NPR.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn March, hourly wages for store clerks and assistants at the top of the pay scale will go up by $1 to $30.20 an hour, rising by another $1 each year after that. Wages for entry-level workers will increase by 50 cents to $20 an hour.\n\nCostco Teamsters spokesperson Matthew McQuaid said the company wouldn't be raising pay if not for the union's pressure. It represents workers at Costco locations in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington.\n\n\"Costco is still shorting their workers because nonunion workers lack the retirement security of a defined benefit pension plan and the job protections that come with a union contract,\" McQuaid said in an email.\n\nThe Teamsters contract with Costco expires at midnight on Friday. Workers are pushing for better pay and benefits, saying they should be rewarded for helping the chain achieve its record financial gains.\n\nCostco representatives declined comment. The retailer is the third largest in the world by revenue, behind Walmart and Amazon.\n\nLast year, Costco had similarly increased its wages by $1 at the top of the pay scale and 50 cents for others, the company said in its end-of-the year report. The chain's pay is among the highest in retail, which has helped Costco maintain a lower turnover rate than most rivals.\n\nVachris' memo, dated Tuesday, named other planned changes, including vacation time for new workers in their first year.\n\n\"There's a plain and simple reason Costco chooses to offer industry-leading wages\" and various benefits, the memo said. \"We believe our employees are the very best in the retail industry.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLast week, Costco made news as its shareholders rejected a proposal by a conservative think tank pushing the company to roll back its diversity hiring practices. This made Costco an outlier as many U.S.-based corporations have begun retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nOn Monday, 19 Republican state attorneys general wrote to Costco demanding the company repeal its DEI policies within a month.",

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAbout 18,000 Teamsters are set to strike 56 Costco stores across six states early Saturday unless an 11th-hour agreement prevents what would be the largest retail strike in US history.\n\nTalks resumed between the two sides Thursday, but there have been no updates on the negotiations. In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time , and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.\n\nThe unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington. Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don\u2019t report to work, \u201call of our locations will be open for business this weekend,\u201d an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.\n\nMeanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job. Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.\n\nHistory of above-market wages\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that \u201cour philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.\u201d\n\nIn late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the results in Norfolk,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed in our employees; we\u2019re disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders. The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty unique letter. I\u2019ve never seen management take that position,\u201d Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.\n\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco\u2019s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion \u2014 up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco\u2019s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: \u201cPro worker? Prove it!\u201d and \u201cRecord profits = record contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cCostco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,\u201d Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cIf Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we\u2019ll shut them down.\u201d\n\nJacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions. Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\n\nJacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union. But she said it\u2019s possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.\n\nO\u2019Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said. He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump\u2019s attacks in the early days of the new term. Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.\n\n\u201cThis union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing we know about this administration is they\u2019ll reward their friends and punish their enemies.\u201d\n\nMichael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn\u2019t enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company\u2019s bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.\n\nKatherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,\u201d she said. \u201cThe longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn\u2019t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services and have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees.",

(Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg News)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. is raising pay for most of its hourly U.S. workers to more than $30 an hour amid contract talks with unionized employees.\n\nThe company will raise hourly pay for employees at the top of its pay scale over the next three years, CEO Ron Vachris wrote in a memo to staff this week that was viewed by Bloomberg News. In March, these workers\u2019 hourly pay will rise by $1 per hour to $30.20, with additional $1 increases coming in each of the next two years.\n\nWorkers at the bottom of the scale will get raises of 50 cents to $20, according to the memo. The changes apply to employees at non-union locations.\n\nIssaquah, Wash.-based Costco, which ranks No. 47 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America, declined to comment. The company and the union that represents thousands of its workers are in negotiations over a new collective bargaining contract. The current contract is set to expire on Jan. 31, and Costco Teamsters \u2014 which represents less than 10% of the company\u2019s roughly 219,000 employees in the U.S. \u2014 has voted to authorize a strike, demanding better pay and benefits.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nMatthew McQuaid, a spokesman for Costco Teamsters, said in an email that while the union is pleased that workers will make more money, it was the group\u2019s pressure that led to the increase.\n\nCostco\u2019s hourly U.S. employees typically start at an entry rate before getting periodic increases based on their time with the company until they hit the top of the scale. Because of the higher wages it pays, the retailer has a low rate of worker turnover and more than half of Costco\u2019s hourly workers are in the top category. As of July, the retailer\u2019s starting wage was $19.50.\n\nOther benefits for non-union workers include an additional week of vacation after 30 years of employment and vacation for new employees during their first year.\n\nDavid Bell, CEO of CloneOps.ai, discusses the impact of AI on the trucking industry. Tune in above or by going to RoadSigns.ttnews.com.\n\nU.S. retailers have been boosting pay and benefits for hourly employees in recent years as it\u2019s gotten harder to find workers. While pandemic-era labor shortages have improved, for many chains it\u2019s still tough to hire and retain employees. The mean hourly wage for U.S. retail workers stands at $14.12, according to government data.\n\nWalmart Inc. said this month it would increase compensation for its market managers, who each supervise roughly a dozen store managers, with higher annual stock grants, bonuses and base pay effective in the company\u2019s new fiscal year. The company ranks No. 1 on the private TT100. Walmart, Target Corp. and other big-box retailers have also raised pay for store workers in recent years.",

            "content": "Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) has routinely been a top retail stock to own. It's coming off a stellar performance in 2024, when its shares rallied nearly 39%. And there's good reason for that, as the company has continued to post strong, resilient growth numbers even as other retailers struggled due to rising costs.\n\nBut the problem is that with the stock rising rapidly and now trading at an inflated valuation, near its all-time high, it could be ripe for a decline. And there could be a major headwind looming, which could provide investors with a reason to consider selling the stock sooner rather than later.\n\nCostco Teamsters union authorizes a strike\n\nLast week, the Costco Teamsters, a union of 18,000 employees, voted in favor of a strike if a new contract is not reached before the current one expires on Jan. 31. That represents a little more than 8% of the workers Costco employs in the U.S., and it could affect more than 50 stores across the country.\n\nThere are a couple of possible ramifications from this.\n\nThe first is the obvious impact this may have on day-to-day operations. While 8% of its workforce may not sound significant, Costco's warehouses are busy, and even a modest decline in workers could adversely impact the experience for shoppers and affect sales.\n\nThere's also the potential damage this may do the company's image; Costco is often seen as a business that takes care of its workers and offers competitive wages and benefits. A prolonged strike with a significant chunk of its U.S. workforce could undermine that perception, and perhaps sour some investors on the business along the way.\n\nA high-priced valuation means investors aren't expecting any hiccups\n\nCostco's stock, given its high valuation, also makes it vulnerable to sell-off should there be any issues. The stock is trading at a whopping 56 times its trailing earnings and is effectively priced to perfection. Even without the possible headwind of a labor disruption affecting the business in the near term, I'd argue it's overpriced, given its modest single-digit growth rate.\n\nRetail investors clearly love Costco's brand and are willing to pay a high multiple for it. But this is still a company that generated just 7.5% revenue growth in its most recent quarter (period ending Nov. 24, 2024).\n\nIt's a good business and there's a lot more growth ahead for Costco in the future, but investors are paying an obscene multiple for it right now. Not only can that mean limited returns in the near term, but it can also make the stock vulnerable to a sell-off. If this labor unrest lasts for a long stretch, it could dampen.\n\nCostco's stock is overpriced, and a decline could be overdue\n\nI'm not overly concerned with Costco's labor issues, as these are issues all retailers have to deal with at some point, whether they are seen as good companies or not. And this is not something that should adversely weigh on the business over the long term.\n\nWhat's more problematic is the stock's valuation. Although Costco is a good business to invest in for the long haul, that doesn't mean that the stock is worth buying at any price. Investors should consider the opportunity cost of missing out on an investment because money is tied up in a less-than-optimal one. At such a massive multiple, a lot of growth is already priced into Costco's stock, which can result in modest returns for investors in the future.\n\nWhile Costco may be a great business, the stock is simply too expensive for it to be worth buying right now, and a correction could be around the corner, regardless of how the current labor issues play out. There are many other, more attractively priced growth stocks out there that investors can add to their portfolios.",

All submissions will be kept anonymous.\n\nCostco Wholesale store in Irvine, California\n\nOn February 1, 2025, 18,000 Costco workers in the Teamsters union are set to go on strike in five states, the largest strike of the new year in the United States.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Costco workers are not unionized, but the strike will still affect 56 out of 617 warehouse stores. Costco workers are demanding higher wages, improved working conditions, better benefits, seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s image as a \u201cworker-friendly\u201d alternative to Walmart and Amazon, its employees face grueling conditions, erratic scheduling, and wages that have not kept pace with inflation. Entry pay is $19.50 an hour. Many workers report physically demanding shifts with little time for breaks, constant understaffing, and management\u2019s relentless drive for profit at the expense of safety.\n\nOne worker in Irvine told the WSWS that they can\u2019t even take breaks: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to, but it\u2019s just very busy and sometimes you just got to push it off a little bit.\u201d\n\nAnother Costco driver of 30 years complained: \u201cTo tell you the truth, we know absolutely nothing. We\u2019re not being told anything. I\u2019m going to have a pension, but I\u2019m worried that the younger ones\u2014and there\u2019s a lot of young workers here\u2014will not have a pension. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s immense profitability\u2014bringing in over $250 billion in revenue and a net income of $7.3 billion in 2024 alone\u2014has been built on the backs of these workers. Meanwhile, executive compensation continues to soar: Costco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ron M. Vachris, received a total compensation package of approximately $12.2 million in 2024.\n\nThe strike is set to unfold amid a massive assault against immigrant workers by Trump, the tip of the spear of his bid for a presidential dictatorship. It also coincides with a strike vote by King Soopers grocery workers in Colorado, affiliated to United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), and thousands of Safeway workers in that state who are working without a contract. Over the course of the year, contracts for tens of thousands more grocery workers are due to expire.\n\nThis demonstrating the potential for a broader struggle of the whole working class, which must be mobilized in defense of immigrants and democratic rights. This requires the building of independent rank-and-file committees which, as the Socialist Equality Party explained in a recent statement, \u201cwill strive to break down all efforts by the two big business parties and the trade union bureaucracies to divide workers along immigration status or national background.\u201d\n\nOn this last point, the Teamsters bureaucracy, under General President Sean O\u2019Brien, is lining up behind Trump\u2019s racist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and attacks on immigrants. He has founded his own podcast, \u201cBetter Bad Ideas\u201d which he uses as a platform for right-wingers such as Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, a major Trump ally and co-conspirator in the events of January 6, 2021. This is part of a broader shift by union officials across the country, who have all declared their \u201cwillingness\u201d to work with Trump.\n\nBut attempts to present Trump\u2019s program in pseudo-populist colors are rapidly breaking down as the scale of his attacks on immigrants and the Constitution becomes clear.\n\nThe unity of the working class requires that workers of all backgrounds defend the rights of immigrants. Immigrant workers make up about 20 percent of the grocery store workforce in the United States, and likely thousands of immigrants will be involved in Saturday\u2019s strike, especially in areas like Southern California with large immigrant populations. The political environment is such that is entirely possible that ICE agents could grab striking Costco workers off the picket lines.\n\nIn reality, workers across the globe\u2014whether in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, or beyond\u2014face the same exploitation at the hands of transnational corporations. Costco\u2019s business model relies on a global supply chain that squeezes workers at every level, from warehouse employees in the U.S. to factory workers in Asia.\n\nBy aligning with Trump, O\u2019Brien and the union officials express their hostility and fear of the workers they claim to represent.\n\nDuring the 2023 UPS contract struggle, the Teamsters leadership betrayed 340,000 workers. After months of militant rhetoric, O\u2019Brien and the Teamsters bureaucracy imposed a contract that paved the way for massive layoffs, including the closure or automation of 200 UPS facilities.\n\nThe Costco strike is following the same script. While O\u2019Brien is posturing as a militant fighter, the aim of the bureaucracy is to contain workers\u2019 anger within the framework of what is acceptable to the two big business parties and corporate America. The Teamsters leadership will attempt to isolate the strike, avoid any broader movement of the working class, and ultimately push through a contract that falls far short of what workers need and deserve.\n\nCritical of the union\u2019s role, a 67-year-old Costco worker told the WSWS that he had had three strokes, which slowed him down. \u201cI got written up on three annual reviews because I\u2019m going slower.\u201d After his second stroke, \u201cthey were treating me like a regular employee but I\u2019m going slower, you know, because I was limping and stuff. I told our union rep, he says, \u2018this is beyond the scope of my duties, I can\u2019t help you.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was crying after I got off, and I said, listen, if you ask a hundred people, they think the union has the ability to help someone who\u2019s doing the job and had two strokes.\u201d He appealed to the Local president: \u201cShe said, he [union rep] is right, there\u2019s nothing that we can do to help you. And I said, wow, that is mind blowing.\u201d\n\nWorkers at Costco, King Soopers, and beyond must reject any attempt to isolate their struggles. The union bureaucracies will attempt to divide these fights into separate, toothless negotiations that ensure the continuation of unacceptable conditions.\n\nThis is a political struggle because it pits the working class against corporate America and the entire political establishment. To win it, Costco workers must break free from the grip of the Teamsters bureaucracy and take matters into their own hands. The only viable path forward is the formation of independent rank-and-file committees, controlled by workers themselves and committed to real struggle.\n\nThese committees must organize democratically, independent of the union bureaucracy, to fight for workers\u2019 real demands and link up with workers in other industries facing similar struggles, including logistics, retail and manufacturing. They must reject the domination of both corporate parties, who serve the interests of big business, join in a struggle against Trump\u2019s fascist agenda, and forge international connections with Costco and other workers worldwide.",

The group claims that DEI programs are discriminatory and put the company at financial risk.\n\nThe attorneys general argued that Costco's policies are illegal and run afoul of President Donald Trump's recent executive orders that limit DEI programs in both the private and public sectors.\n\n\"Although Costco\u2019s motto is 'do the right thing,' it appears that the company is doing the wrong thing\u2014clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal,\" the AGs said in a letter. \"Costco should treat every person equally and based on their merit, rather than based on divisive and discriminatory DEI practices. That reflects President Trump\u2019s executive order encouraging 'the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI discrimination and Preferences.'\"\n\nThe attorneys general gave Costco 30 days to respond. The letter did not state any consequences if Costco fails to respond.\n\nCostco's policy states, \"All decisions regarding recruiting, hiring, promotion, assignment, training, termination and other terms and conditions of employment will be made without unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, work-related injury, covered military or veteran status, political ideology or expression, genetic information, marital status or other protected status.\"\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research said the Supreme Court decision reached in 2023 in SFFA v. Harvard indicated that companies' DEI programs could potentially be illegal. The Supreme Court ruled that affirmative action policies by colleges violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nCostco's board countered that the group was incorrect in its belief that the company's DEI policies violate the law.\n\nRELATED STORY | Costco memberships grow despite price increase as profits surge\n\nThe vote came as numerous companies have eliminated DEI programs in response to backlash from conservatives and President Trump.\n\nWithin hours of taking office, President Trump signed an executive order essentially ridding the federal government of DEI training and positions. The president also eliminated a past executive order that required federal contractors to have non-discriminatory practices in hiring and employment.\n\nRELATED STORY | Presidential Shift: Trump reverses key Biden administration DEI policies",

Pictured, a Costco in Plainfield. (Gary Middendorf/Gary Middendorf)\n\nWhile the proposed Costco received full approval from Yorkville city officials, developers are looking for a sweeter deal to keep them from putting the plans back on the shelf.\n\nThe Yorkville City Council approved the necessary plans, ordinances, and special use permit at their Jan. 28 meeting to allow Costco to build a 160,000-square-foot members-only retail store and a gas fueling facility.\n\nTo get the plans across the finish line, Costco representatives are requesting a sales tax rebate to make the project \u201ceconomically feasible\u201d for Costco.\n\nCity Administrator Bart Olson said that Costco is requesting a $10 million sales tax rebate over 20 years. This includes a 0.75% rebate for the first six years and a 0.5% rebate for the next 14 years.\n\n\u201cMy assumption is that if the city does not agree it would be a dealbreaker, although Costco has not told me that explicitly,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey said they needed it in order to develop in Yorkville because there\u2019s development costs and land acquisition costs that are different than in other communities. Right now we\u2019re buttoning up the language and we hope to vote on it at the next meeting.\u201d\n\nThe site of the development is located on 33.14 acres at the northwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway in the Yorkville Crossing development area.\n\nA full vote on the proposed sales tax rebate is currently scheduled for the Feb. 11 City Council meeting.\n\nAccording to city documents, the potential sales tax rebate to Costco is supported by city officials because the project is expected to create jobs for the city, increase the city\u2019s tax base, and strengthen the city\u2019s commercial sector.\n\nCity officials also argue because the area has remained undeveloped for years, the construction of the Costco would spur further development of the adjacent areas.\n\n\u201cThe development will be a significant regional draw for people outside of the community to come shop here,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThe nearest Costco locations are going to be 20-30 miles away. Their footprint is going to be very wide and that\u2019s a benefit to the community. The added jobs are nice, so is the property taxes, but primarily they generate a ton of sales tax. I would expect them to be one of the city\u2019s largest sales tax generators.\u201d\n\nOlson said the Costco may generate as much as $1 million annually in sales tax revenue for the city.\n\nThe 43.54-acre site for the proposed Costco in Yorkville is located at the northwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway in the \u201cYorkville Crossing\u201d development area. (Provided by the City of Yorkville)\n\nThe city has provided tax rebates before as a strategy to incentivize developments. In 2002, Menards was given an $8 million sales tax rebate. Jewel was provided $3.2 million in the early 2000s. The Kendall Marketplace development is receiving a $15 million sales tax rebate over the next 20 years.\n\nIn addition to the retail store and fueling facility, the development plans include a parking lot with up to 956 stalls, perimeter lots, and lots designated for stormwater management.\n\nThe plans for the development do not currently contain a convenience store alongside the fueling facility. When completed, the gas fueling facility will house 16 gas pumps with 32 fuel dispensers. Costco wants to eventually expand to include 20 gas pumps with 40 fuel dispensers.\n\nAt a previous public hearing, some residents voiced concerns that the influx of shoppers could lead to traffic nightmares in the residential area. Residents were especially concerned with congestion posing safety risks for the nearby public park, which includes baseball fields and biking paths.\n\nCostco representatives said at the meeting that they would provide a connection to the nearby biking and trail system. The representatives said a traffic study they conducted suggested that the Illinois Department of Transportation should consider making timing changes to the intersection of U.S. 34 and Countryside Parkway to mitigate traffic concerns. The traffic study did not recommend additional traffic measures for the intersection at McHugh Road and U.S. 34.\n\nThe current property owner of the site is Joda Land Holding, LLC.",

The Teamsters are accusing the grocery club of not sharing its record $7.4 billion profits with its workers. The Teamsters have accused Costco of engaging in \"illegal and reckless behavior,\" including kicking union reps out of stores, preventing employees from wearing Teamster buttons and changing the locks on union bulletin boards.\n\nSTATE AGS WARN RETAIL GIANT COSTCO FOR DOUBLING DOWN ON 'DISCRIMINATORY' DEI\n\nTalks finally broke down in January when Costco refused to reach a card check agreement. Card check is a process that would make it easier for workers to join unions by eliminating secret ballots. Eighty-five percent of Costco's unionized employees voted to authorize a strike. The strike would affect 50 stores across the U.S. in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Washington.\n\nAs the Costco board voted overwhelmingly to reject an anti-DEI measure brought by activist investors at their shareholders meeting last Friday, workers rallied just outside their Washington offices \u2014 signaling the real fight was yet to come.\n\n\"Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike. Costco Teamsters deserve an industry-leading contract that reflects the company\u2019s massive profits.

The salt we buy, the storage containers we use, and even the towels we clean with are specific and intentional. I get it. When it comes to cooking, he's used to doing things quickly, efficiently, and with the best products and tools available. Oven mitts? Don\u2019t get him started.\n\nThe same goes for plastic food wrap. I used to laugh at his disdain for the thin tubes we\u2019d buy from the grocery store. I\u2019d hear him grumbling and swearing as he tried to wrap leftovers with it. He\u2019d go through rolls quickly, claiming he needed more to \u201cdo it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what normal people use!\u201d I\u2019d insist. \u201cThat's all there is!\u201d Silly me.\n\nFast forward to a few years later, when we moved within driving distance of a Costco. One day, thinking simply that it was a good deal, I purchased a two-pack of Kirkland Signature Stretch-Tite Plastic Food Wrap. It didn\u2019t even occur to me to mention it to my husband. I just slid one of the boxes into a drawer and forgot about it.\n\nA few weeks later I heard him rustling around the kitchen. \u201cI love this plastic wrap!\u201d He called out to me. \u201cIt\u2019s just as good as what we have in the restaurant!\u201d\n\nIn love? I was stunned!\n\n\u201cIt comes with more plastic, which in turn makes it heavier, which makes it easier to wrap things because it stays steady,\u201d he explained when I asked him to elaborate. \u201cYou want to put something on the counter and be able to pull the plastic wrap out without the whole box sliding. Plastic wrap clings better when you stretch it, the weight makes it easier to stretch.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, you actually use way less,\u201d he added happily. He hates waste.\n\nCostco\n\nHe went on to say that the teeth on the Kirkland box are extra sharp, which not only provides a clean cut, it also helps keep the roll from getting tangled.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have to untangle the plastic wrap every time you use it. It\u2019s a waste of time and money,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s nice to leave it ready to go for the next person who uses it.\u201d\n\nThough it hadn\u2019t evoked the same passion in me, I realized that I too had been experiencing the most positive plastic wrap experience of my life. And we\u2019d barely made a dent in it.\n\nAs it turns out, my colleagues at Southern Living also adore Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature Stretch-Tite Plastic Food Wrap, noting that it \u201clasts for years\u201d and boasts not only a superior stretch but a superior slide cutter as well.\n\n\u201cI initially bought it for the value but it is a great quality. I\u2019m pretty sure ours has moved houses with us, we\u2019ve had it so long,\u201d associate editorial director Katie Rousso says.\n\nCostco sells its Kirkland Signature Stretch-Tite Plastic Food Wrap in two sizes: 750 square feet rolls (sold in a pack of two) and a single, giant 3,000-square-foot roll. I prefer the two-pack option because the 750-square-foot roll fits nicely in our kitchen drawer.\n\nSouthern Living associate food editor Alana Al-Hatlani is the proud owner of a 3,000-square-foot roll, though she notes that it is too big to fit in a drawer. Instead, she keeps hers on top of her refrigerator.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine though,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m never buying plastic wrap again.\u201d",

Costco turned a deaf ear to the rally outside its headquarters in Issaquah, Wash.\n\nSome 18,000 Costco warehouse workers in five states\u2014New York, New Jersey and on the Pacific Coast\u2014will strike after their current contract ends on January 31 unless they reach an acceptable new pact, the Teamsters announced. The strike authorization passed with 85% of the vote on January 22.\n\nKey issues in the bargaining, which has gone nowhere since it began in November, are better wages, paid family leave and sick time and curbs on company surveillance of workers, who are members of nine Teamster locals at the 56 warehouse stores the current contract covers.\n\nThat pact, which began in 2022, has first-year base pay of $17.50 hourly for service assistants, $18.50 for service clerks, $19 for meat cutters and $21.50 for truck drivers, with 50-cent yearly raises for all workers and a first-year added premium of $1.50 for the truckers.\n\nFight flaws in current contract\n\nThe current contract caps paid family leave and sick time and rolls them together with state disability benefits and workers comp. It also orders pregnant woman workers to bring in a doctor\u2019s note when seeking pregnancy leave.\n\n\u201cCostco Teamsters deserve an industry-leading contract that reflects the company\u2019s massive profits. If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we\u2019ll shut them down,\u201d union President Sean O\u2019Brien told the crowd.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, we\u2019ve told Costco our members won\u2019t work a day past January 31 without a historic, industry-leading agreement. Costco\u2019s greedy executives have less than two weeks to do the right thing. If they refuse, they\u2019ll have no one to blame but themselves when our members go on strike,\u201d O\u2019Brien said previously. Costco is \u201ccatering to Wall Street,\u201d not its workers, the union said.\n\nThe union did not say how much it seeks for its Costco members, but the firm has the money to pay them. Over the life of the current contract, Costco revenues rose from $222.7 billion to $254 billion. Since 2018, pre-pandemic, profits grew 135%, to $7.4 billion now.\n\nThe AFL-CIO\u2019s Executive Paywatch reported then-CEO Craig Jelinek earned $16,870,623 in compensation in 2023, the last year for which records are available. All but $1.1 million was in stock compensation. Jelinek\u2019s compensation was 336 times the median compensation of a Costco worker.\n\nPay for current Costco CEO Ron Vachris has yet to be filed with the federal government, whose figures the federation uses for Paywatch.\n\nBy contrast, \u201cThe pandemic created a super profitable company, more than doubled their profits,\u201d veteran shop steward Chris Reed told Modern Retail \u201cMeanwhile, the wages that were offered [in] the contract immediately at the end or near end of the pandemic didn\u2019t really meet the new reality of inflation and the reality of cost of living,\u201d veteran shop steward Chris Reed told\n\nPreparing to strike, Teamsters had staged practice picket lines in Hayward, Calif., and Sumner, Wash., plus picketing and a rally on Long Island and a large rally in San Diego, all in mid-January, the union reported.\n\n\u201cThis strike vote is a direct response to Costco\u2019s greed and blatant disregard for the bargaining process,\u201d said Tom Erickson, the union\u2019s Warehouse Division Director. \u201cCostco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it\u2019s failing to live up to that reputation.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s worker-friendly reputation is in contrast to warehouse competitors such as Amazon, but relations between the workers and bosses have been going downhill since at least August.\n\nThat\u2019s when the union sought the right to card-check recognition at non-union warehouses\u2014the large majority of such plants\u2014and received a brusque \u201cno\u201d in reply.\n\nAnd Costco \u201cexpelled union representatives from stores, harassed and intimidated workers for wearing Teamsters buttons, sent employees home and blocked the Teamsters from providing updates on in-store union bulletin boards during negotiations,\u201d Forbes reported.\n\nPeople\u2019s World, we believe news and information should be free and accessible to all, but we need your help.

            "content": "Growing up in Japan, home to some of the world's longest-living people, I fell in love with traditional Japanese food at a young age. My passion for clean and healthy eating is what inspired me to be a nutritionist. My diet has always been centered around nutritious, longevity-fueling and environmentally-friendly foods. Now living in the U.S., I often get my groceries at local markets or organic farms. But when I'm looking to save money and stock up on healthy goods, I send my husband on his favorite errand: a solo trip to Costco. Here are the Costco items I trust and can't live without:\n\n1. Extra firm tofu\n\nThere's nothing like a hearty bowl of tofu and veggies Michiko Tomioka\n\n2. Frozen edamame\n\nCostco grocery haul Michiko Tomioka\n\nEdamame is another must-have soy product in our house. At Costco, you can get a bag of 12 individually wrapped 8-ounce portions. This is my most-recommended snack to friends and family. Just microwave a bag for two minutes and enjoy it as a low-calorie, high-protein snack. Edamame is also rich in fiber, antioxidants and vitamin K.\n\n3. Dried goji berries\n\nGoji berries have been used as ancient medicine in East Asia for thousands of years. I add them to many dishes, like miso soup, salad, jams and chia pudding. They add natural sweetness and texture. A fourth-cup of goji berries has only 100 calories, 4 grams of protein and fiber, and 800 milligrams of potassium \u2014 more than what you get in one banana.\n\n4. Vegetables\n\nIt's so important to eat your vegetables! Only one out of 10 American adults meet the minimum requirement of vegetable intake, which is five servings daily. I often suggest doubling that number. Regularly eating a variety of veggies makes my body feel clean and energized. Costco has an amazing selection of organic vegetables. We always get the mushroom samplers, English cucumbers and prewashed French beans. They help make weekday meal-prepping easy.\n\n5. Fruits\n\nSome of my favorite fruits are oranges, blueberries, bananas and blackberries. I typically buy them organic because I like to eat the skins of some fruits, like kiwi and citruses, for extra fiber and antioxidants. For many fruits, the skin actually has more nutrients than the inside. Avocados are a must-buy at Costco. I like to slice a few into my salad, mixed with lemon juice, walnuts and my signature miso dressing. My husband now uses avocado as a spread on sandwiches instead of butter or cream cheese, and he feels so much healthier!\n\n6. Chicken breast and salmon\n\nSalmon and veggies bowl for Genki and Happy Michiko Tomioka\n\nI don't eat meat, but my dog Genki and cat Happy need their animal protein. I'm not a fan of ultra-processed pet food, so I like to balance their meals with Costco's organic chicken breast, frozen Atlantic salmon, some edamame, tofu, vegetables, and a variety of legumes. They absolutely love it, and I can't remember the last time they were sick.\n\n7. Unsalted almond butter\n\nAlmond butter is high in monounsaturated fats, vitamin E, magnesium and other essential minerals that promote heart health. I like to use almond butter instead of oil or butter for baking and cooking. Just make sure you check the ingredients to make sure there's no added salt or sugar.\n\n8. Canned sardines\n\nSardines are one of the most sustainable fishes. For each 3-ounce serving, you get 2 grams of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. This is my husband's go-to \"emergency\" food because it's so fast to prepare. Just sprinkle some turmeric, black pepper and fresh (or powdered) ginger. He eats it with rice, whole wheat bread or noodles.\n\n9. Matcha powder",

Don't get us wrong, Costco's jugs of maple syrup are an incredible deal, but the packaging does leave something to be desired.\n\nThe issue with the maple syrup is that it often runs down the outside of the bottle, leading to a sticky mess and crusty lid.

You don't like not being able to close it because the syrup has crystallized around the rim or because it simply broke off?\"\n\nIn response to a common solution, to clean the top after each use, many suggest this shouldn't be necessary.

When removing the tamper seal use a sharp knife and run it around the inside of the bottle opening, leaving the rim of the seal intact and your cap should line up properly!\"\n\nNot everyone takes issue with Costco's maple syrup bottle, however. Several noted that they've never experienced leaky or crystallized syrup, and believe it must be a user error as opposed to a product issue. Others pointed out that a wipe-down with a paper towel only takes a second. Ultimately, Costco's marketing team might be aware of its problem, as shown by their apparent solution. The Costco website image of the syrup being poured conveniently leaves the cap off entirely.\n\nIf your maple syrup woes are less about the lid and instead the fact that a single liter just isn't enough, you can always take a trip up to a Costco in Canada and purchase a 55-gallon drum of maple syrup instead! If you go through that much syrup, you probably have your own dispenser anyway.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHungry for more?

            "content": "Unless it was used to yield the crispiest and most luxurious grilled cheese sandwiches, mayonnaise used to be an ingredient I rarely reached for. That was before I started developing recipes for Marley Spoon (a meal-kit service) in Germany. One of the first things I learned about cooking in Europe is that Europeans love saucy meals. And due to the budget and packaging constraints of a meal-kit service, we weren't always able to develop sauces from scratch.\n\nThat's when mayonnaise started to creep its way into more and more of my recipes. Slowly but surely, the fatty, eggy condiment that used to give me the ick emerged as a super versatile ingredient, one that not only imparts tangy flavor but also richness and depth in a dish. Need an easy sauce to drizzle over fish tacos? Just mix chipotle with some mayo. What about something to round out a grain bowl? Again, the answer is mayo.\n\nIn the Marley Spoon test kitchen in Berlin, there was one mayo brand that reigned supreme: Hellmann's. It's not surprising. Hellmann's is a beloved brand among countless culinary professionals, from fine dining restaurants to celebrity cooks like Julia Child and Martha Stewart. Even the Allrecipes community called it the best mayo in stores. While other brands like Duke's and Kewpie are also popular, Hellmann's culinary influence is hard to ignore.\n\nWhen I discovered that Costco's highest-rated mayo is not Hellmann's, I had to do a double-take. It wasn't Hellmann's, but it featured the same navy and yellow brand colors, same typeface, same \"Bring Out the Best\" tagline, and even the same two eggs are shown smack dab in the center of the label. The only discernible difference between this label and Hellmann's is the name\u2014this one is called Best Foods.\n\n\n\nIs Best Foods the Same as Hellmann's?\n\nIt appears that Best Foods and Hellmann's are indeed the same brand and are both owned by Unilever. However, Hellmann's is the name used for regions east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. Best Foods, on the other hand, is what's used west of the Rocky Mountains, East and Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. So, how did we end up with two identical products that are sold under different names depending on where you are in the world?\n\nBest Foods / Hellmann's / Allrecipes\n\nAccording to lore, Richard Hellmann emigrated from Vetschau, Germany to New York City in the early 20th century, where he opened a deli in 1905. It was around this time that he developed a recipe for an already-made mayo. It became so popular that he had to close shop and open a factory to keep up with the demand, selling under the name Hellmann's Blue Ribbon Mayonnaise.\n\nWhile Hellmann's was the mayo of choice on the East Coast, there was another company called Best Foods that was producing mayo and other condiments that were widely popular on the West Coast. Best Foods bought Hellmann's in 1927 and because both brands were already household names in their respective regions, the company decided to keep the names and recipes unaltered.\n\nThese days, if you take a look at the ingredients list and nutrition facts for both products, they are nearly identical, which begs the question, do they taste the same?\n\n\n\nBest Foods Vs. Hellmann's\n\nNow that I live on the West Coast, Hellmann's feels like a distant memory. It hadn't even occurred to me that Hellmann's is only available east of the Rockies, but it's true\u2014the grocery aisles of Seattle are lined with Best Foods Real Mayonnaise.\n\nWhile a side-by-side test would be the best way to gauge how similar the two products are, I have to admit that comparing Best Foods against my memory of Hellmann's, there doesn't seem to be a detectable difference. Much like Hellmann's, Best Foods possesses a custardy and delicate mouthfeel with a pop of acidity that's perfect for brightening any dish and boosting it with flavor.\n\nDotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\nAnd I'm not alone in thinking that. Take a look at the nearly 2000 5-star reviews on Costco's webpage and you'll find that people who love one brand or the other use them interchangeably. \"THE Best Mayo. Period. Ask any chef: it\u2019s Best Foods in the West and Hellmann\u2019s in the East- same excellent product, different name,\" wrote one fan.\n\n\"I have used Best Foods mayonnaise forever and would not consider using another brand other than Hellmann's when I am east of the Mississippi,\" raved another.\n\nOne Costco shopper simply wrote, \"If it is Hellmann's or Best Food it is good\" and I couldn't agree more.\n\n",

File Photo by Kevin Dietsch/UPI | License Photo\n\nJan. 25 (UPI) -- Aficionados of Costco's famous $1.50 hot dogs will once again be able to top off their cheap treats with a Coca-Cola after more than a decade of unavailability at the discount retailer, its CEO says. Costco's promotion of the inexpensive hot dog coupled with a Coke at its food courts became one of its signature branding elements in the decades after its founding, but in 2013, the chain opted to drop Coke products in favor of competitor Pepsi. Advertisement\n\nThat decision is now being repealed, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said Thursday at a shareholder's meeting, according to CNN.\n\n\"We will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola,\" he said.\n\nThe impending decision was first reported on Dec. 17 by the Costco Insider online blog.\n\nThe switch to Pepsi 12 years ago came because Costco was trying to cut costs in a way that would enable it to retain the $1.50 hot dog price, according to the Insider. The retailer ended up going with Pepsi because Coke wouldn't match the prices it was offering to rival Walmart and it was imperative for Costco to retain the hot dog price point -- per the orders of co-founder Jim Sinegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe promotion was so beloved by Sinegal that he warned his successor as CEO, W. Craig Jelinek, not to raise the price under any circumstances, even though it was a money-loser, Jelinek reportedly told a local Chamber of Commerce audience in 2018.\n\nNow, after a 12-year absence, Coke will finally be back the fountains at the Costco food courts, sparking joy among some fans.\n\n\"Coke is a much, much better option. I'm happy for this news!\" poster Rexpiper wrote in Costco Insider's comments section, while another, Wanda Flora, added, \"Thank you!! I only drink Pepsi when it's a last resort. Glad you are going back to the good stuff.\"",

            "content": "Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nAccording to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had submitted the proposal, arguing that Costco\u2019s DEI initiatives hold \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe think tank has made a similar proposal to Apple, and like some American companies that already scaled back or retreated from their diversity policies, cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nBut Costco\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion. The board said it believes \u201cour commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\u201d\n\nThe directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \u201ccreativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\u201d and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.\n\nIn advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData\u2019s retail division, said Costco can be confident the proposal will be rejected.\n\n\u201cI think people generally have confidence in Costco\u2019s management, and there\u2019s an attitude of \u2018Why rock the boat? It\u2019s sailing very nicely,\u2019\u201d Saunders said.\n\nCostco\u2019s public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands, including Walmart,McDonald\u2019s and John Deere.\n\nLast week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation\u2019s largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company\u2019s DEI policies, a move they called \u201cdisheartening.\u201d\n\nProminent technology companies, including Amazon and Meta \u2014 the parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2014 also have rolled back DEI initiatives, which are expected to face opposition from the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nEmboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThe plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.\n\nAs for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company\u2019s 300,000 employees worldwide \u201care potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\u201d If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.\n\nCostco has a chief diversity officer, but the company\u2019s executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco\u2019s management team typically stay a long time given the company\u2019s solid and stable financial performance.\n\nIn other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn\u2019t have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn\u2019t focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple\u2019s Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center\u2019s resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \u201cconsistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.\n\nApple\u2019s board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \u201cto create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank\u2019s DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\u201d he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cAnd wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.\n\n\u201cSo if you are an Apple or another company who\u2019s done that, and you\u2019re confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\u201d he said.",

(The question was answered at the 44:24 mark of the presentation.)\n\n\u201cIs the food court truly switching back to Coke products?\u201d one person asked.\n\n\u201cYes, that is accurate,\u201d Vachris said in response. \u201cThis summer, we will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nThat means Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke and Sprite will soon be available at the fountains instead of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Starry.\n\nThe confirmation comes after Costco Insider, which often publishes online articles about deals and coupons before Costco does and bills itself as \u201cthe No. 1 website on the internet about Costco,\u201d reported last month the change was coming. In its coverage, Cheapism also cited an anonymous user on Costco\u2019s Reddit forum in December alerting people to the change.\n\nCNN reported the deal not only includes the machines and syrup in the sodas, but cups, straws and other products as well.\n\nCostco roundup: Some item prices lowered, more stores coming, big sub for sale\n\nCostco leaves Pepsi after more than a decade\n\nAfter serving Coke products for decades in its food courts, Costco switched to Pepsi in 2013, as multiple media outlets stated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big shift,\u201d then-Costco Vice President of Food Services Alan Bubitz told beverage publication BevNET in 2013. \u201cThey\u2019re the only vendor we\u2019ve ever had for the majority of the business locations.\u201d\n\nBubitz expected pushback to the change to Pepsi from Coke at the time. But he also told BevNET at that time the change from Coke to Pepsi was being made in an attempt to preserve the iconic deal where customers can get a 22-ounce cup of soda and a hot dog for $1.50.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to please everybody,\u201d Bubitz said to the specialty media outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to preserve the integrity of the price point.\u201d\n\nSo, will a hot dog and a Coke still cost $1.50 at Costco?\n\nCostco most recently confirmed last May via Executive Vice President and CFO Gary Millerchip in an earnings call the price of the combo will remain the same.\n\n\u201cTo clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe,\u201d Millerchip said.\n\nCostco is keeping the price of that combo the same despite inflation impacting the wholesale retailer\u2019s cost to produce it.\n\nBusiness news: Costco successfully defends its diversity policies as other US companies scale theirs back\n\nCNN reported last year that if Costco\u2019s kept pace with inflation, the famous hot dog deal would be three times as expensive as it was in 1985 when the company first set the price \u2014 nearly $4.50.\n\nTalking about the deal in 2009 with The Seattle Times, Costco founder and then-CEO Jim Sinegal was asked what it meant if the company increased the price of that deal.\n\n\u201cThat I\u2019m dead,\u201d Sinegal responded.\n\nWhen asked why it was so significant, Sinegal explained to the Times that even then \u2014 more than 15 years ago \u2014 people brought up how great the deal is.\n\n\u201cBecause everybody talks about it,\u201d Sinegal said. \u201cPeople look at that hot dog and say a buck fifty, this is unbelievable. It\u2019s the same thing you\u2019d spend $7 or $8 at the ballpark for and not get the same quality dog. It\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re known for.\u201d\n\nThe Costco shareholders call Thursday where the change to Coke was announced didn\u2019t reveal any more information about the price of the hot dog deal, but the company did reveal it sold a record 229 million hot dog combos in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nSteve Coogan is the lead editor of MyNorthwest.

            "content": "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\n\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nTarget has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the DEI decisions as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s decades-long process to create \u201cinclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis.\n\nA 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\n\nWalmart, McDonald\u2019s, Ford, Harley-Davison and John Deere are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.\n\nPresident Donald Trump this week signaled his administration\u2019s agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs across the federal government. The order calls for revoking all DEI mandates, policies, preferences and activities, along with the review and revision of existing employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs.\n\nBut not Costco\n\nStill, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nAccording to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco\u2019s board of directors had recommended a no vote.\n\nApple\u2019s board and the CEO of JPMorgan bank also have expressed a commitment to preserving their companies\u2019 DEI activities.\n\nUnlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target\u2019s work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\nBut the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\n\nGetting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.\n\nSteering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \u201cinclusivity is a core belief at Target\u201d and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \u201ccorresponds with their gender identity.\u201d\n\nBut after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.\n\nIn 2023, Target removed some of its Pride Month merchandise after online complaints and in-store confrontations that the retailer said threatened employees\u2019 well-being. The company decided last year not to stock Pride Month products at every U.S. store.",

The stock has also been a big winner for investors.\n\nCostco's share price has soared roughly 35% over the last 12 months. The stock has tripled over the last five years. Will the good times keep rolling? Here's what's next for Costco, according to Wall Street.\n\nBehind Costco's strong momentum\n\nThere's a simple explanation why Costco has delivered such impressive returns: Its business is booming. Costco reported year-over-year revenue growth of 7.5% in its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended on Nov. 24, 2024. The discount chain's profits jumped 13.2% year over year.\n\nCostco had 77.4 million paid members at the end of its fiscal Q1, up 7.6% from the prior-year period. Its membership renewal rate was 90.4% with an even more impressive rate of 92.8% for the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe company is well known for its giant warehouses that offer a wide variety of products in bulk. Costco operated 896 of these warehouses at the end of Q1. It expects to increase the total to 916 during fiscal year 2025. E-commerce has also become a key growth driver for Costco. In fiscal Q1, the company's e-commerce sales rose 13% year over year.\n\nThis momentum accelerated in December. Costco reported year-over-year net sales growth of 8% with e-commerce sales soaring 34.4%. This unusually large e-commerce sales increase was due in large part to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday occurring one week later in calendar year 2024 than they did in 2023.\n\nWhat analysts predict\n\nDoes Wall Street think Costco will be able to keep up its winning ways? Yes, but not at the pace we've seen over the last 12 months.\n\nThe consensus 12-month price target for Costco reflects an upside potential of around 8%. This projected gain isn't bad, but it's well below the returns the stock has delivered in each of the last two years. Not every analyst is bullish about Costco. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by financial markets data and infrastructure provider LSEG in January, 13 recommended holding the stock with one rating it underperform.\n\nAnalysts are more upbeat about Costco's revenue growth, though. The average revenue estimate for fiscal 2025 is 7.14%. Costco's revenue increased by 5% year over year in fiscal 2024. This percentage didn't fully reflect the company's improvement, though, because fiscal 2024 had 52 weeks while fiscal 2023 had 53 weeks.\n\nHowever, it's a different story for Wall Street's earnings projections. Costco's earnings per share (EPS) vaulted roughly 17% higher year over year in fiscal 2024. The average analysts' EPS estimate for fiscal 2025 reflects an increase of 9.7%.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Costco?\n\nI think Wall Street's optimism about Costco's business is warranted. The company continues to execute well. Its e-commerce strategy and partnerships with Instacart and Uber Technologies are especially paying off. Costco's private-label product sales are growing faster than the rest of its business. Disruption in the retail pharmacy market is presenting a great opportunity for the company -- one that it's seizing.\n\nSure, Costco could face some challenges. The potential for port strikes in Canada, the Eastern U.S., and India could cause headaches. When asked about the prospects for increased tariffs in the second Trump administration in Costco's Q1 earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip acknowledged, \"Tariffs raise costs, so that's not something that we see as a positive in general.\"\n\nHowever, Costco is pretty adept at adjusting its supply chain to at least partially address issues caused by port strikes. The company also has plans in place to adjust as needed to mitigate cost increases related to tariffs.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Costco's share price continuing to rise over the next 12 months? Probably, but I'd be lying if I said valuation wasn't a concern. Costco's price-to-earnings ratio is near its highest level ever. It wouldn't be surprising if the stock pulled back at some point in the not-too-distant future. If such a pullback happens, though, I'd view it as a buying opportunity.",

His reply? \u201cWe will be converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\nLongtime Costco members will recall that Coke products used to be a food court staple. The company switched to Pepsi in 2013.

The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"\n\nCostco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including Meta, Ford, McDonald's and Walmart have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.\n\n\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a proposal asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"\n\nThe think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nCostco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"\n\nThe directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.\n\nIn advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.\n\n\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.\n\nCostco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"\n\nEmboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThe Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.\n\nCostco's financial performance\n\nAs for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.\n\nCostco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.\n\nThe warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.\n\nIn other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.\n\nApple's support of DEI\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.\n\nApple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"\n\nTrump's actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.\n\n\"So if you are an Apple or another company who's done that, and you're confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\" he said.",

With their current contract set to expire on January 31, Teamsters are demanding an industry-leading agreement and ready to strike if Costco refuses to deliver.\n\n\u201cCostco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M.

It was on these trips that I truly came to understand the beauty of buying in bulk. Of course, once I realized you could snag a large bottle of pure vanilla extract for less than ten dollars, I had to pick one up for myself as well.\n\nThose days are long behind me, and I wince at the price of vanilla at my neighborhood grocery store now, frequently opting to substitute a splash of bourbon rather than shelling out nearly ten dollars for a dinky bottle of vanilla. And although the myth that imitation vanilla is made with beaver gland secretions has been largely debunked, I'd still prefer to use the real deal or at least a boozy substitute.\n\nSo maybe it's time to return to my bulk shopping days of yore. In fact, if you're a Costco member, vanilla is just one baking staple you should add to your shopping cart. You can pick up two sixteen-ounce bottles of pure vanilla extract at Costco for just $13.99 each. Compare that to a two-ounce bottle of McCormick pure vanilla extract from a smaller grocery store: It's over ten dollars!",

But only now are most shareholders getting a chance to weigh in on such matters.\n\nThe membership-only retailer has more than 300,000 employees globally and about 219,000 in the United States, according to its 2024 annual report.",

While their new song, \u201cBreak the BOOM! Meter\u201d can\u2019t be fully isolated from their other antics, it sees them experimenting with a real metal group, the AMH Band, for an enlightening song that is more or less about the same material as their other tracks. Regardless, these takes by the Life section may surprise you.\n\nBen Lassy, Life Editor (he/him/his):\n\nMy boom meter is shattered. Utterly demolished. All this, and I gave the boys\u2019 last song a perfect score out of a gesture of festive kindness. This song feels like getting into the shower in the morning, expecting the water to be nice and hot; but no, it\u2019s freezing, and two walking advertisements are singing in your ears.\n\nIt goes without saying that after an experience like that your day is ruined. That series of events is this song. The first few seconds of metal (not tarnished by the guys\u2019 singing) is the hot water, everything else is the cold water.\n\nI think for a truly perfect Costco Guys song, they need to get an outside band (like AMH) and then not sing on the track. Maybe they can be on the cover, but for the sake of good music, I think there have been enough novelty tracks from America\u2019s favorite duo.\n\nRating 2.3/5\n\nNoa Climor, Social Media Outreach Coordinator (she/her/hers):\n\nTeam \u2026 we might have a winner. The Costco Guys pulled this song off with none other than The Rizzler himself and a fascinating music video that really pulls you in. \u201cBreak the BOOM! Meter\u201d is truly one of a kind, and what can I say \u2014 I\u2019ve grown rather fond of these reviews with the rest of the Life team. While I can\u2019t say that I will be listening to this again, I can say that I am more than happy to listen to other songs released by our dear pals, A.J. and Big Justice. This had a tune and wild lyrics and served as a fun distraction from classes.\n\nRating: 3/5 Booms View this post on Instagram A post shared by Andrew Befumo Jr. (@a.j.andbigjustice)\n\nMaleena Muzio, Staff Writer (she/her/hers):\n\n\u201cBreak the BOOM! Meter\u201d sadly might be the Costco Guys\u2019 best song yet. Coming back from their Christmas song, \u201cJingle BOOM!,\u201d it\u2019s definitely an improvement, which could not have been that hard to do. The Costco Guys decided to veer away from their pop/hip-hop sound \u2014 if you could call it that \u2014 and delve into metal, adding the AMH Band and The Rizzler to the mix.\n\nYes, The Rizzler is on the song and oddly enough, shreds the guitar. If you are into Imagine Dragons, I can imagine that you might actually like this song. Though, if you like literally anything else, you will probably hate it! All I can say is thank you to the Costco Guys for putting out a song that somewhat resembles music, instead of synthesized elf chants.\n\nRating: 2.5/5 Booms\n\nJames Fitzpatrick, Associate Life Editor (he/him/his):\n\nThis is incredible. I like to think my opinion holds some weight as an avid fan of metal, so the bass drops when the boys say \u201cBoom\u201d tickle my brain in the same way as slam death metal. The Costco Guys bring the boom more than they ever have before, and I fear they\u2019re approaching dangerous power levels. The reference to double-chunk chocolate cookies and chicken bakes proves they haven\u2019t forgotten their roots, yet the explosive chorus is largely performed by the frontman of the AMH Band. Although the band as a whole is a bit cookie-cutter, they give the Costco Guys a solid foundation to create their most impactful song yet\n\nI\u2019ve also heard rumors that The Rizzler\u2019s rap verse has Zack de la Rocha sweating in his boots because his throne is in jeopardy. And let\u2019s discuss the cinematography for a second. The ellipsoidal stage lights that shine on these musicians throughout much of the song help enhance the anthemic nature of this track as if I\u2019m attending their eventual tour. Along with the copious automobiles shown throughout the video, the listener is reminded that A.J. and Big Justice are one-half of the greatest American family of all time. I will make sure to dedicate a section to this song in particular in my academic research paper about the positive correlation between content from the Costco Guys and increased sales at Costco.\n\nRating: 4/5 Booms",

We believe that our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are legally appropriate, and nothing in the proposal demonstrates otherwise.\u201d\n\nSeveral companies \u2014 including Walmart , McDonald\u2019s , Meta , Lowe\u2019s and John Deere \u2014 have recently decided to curtail or eliminate their DEI programs in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. In that case, the court held that race-based admissions programs violate the equal-protection clause of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment .\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, in a statement announcing its decision earlier this month, said it will no longer set \u201caspirational representation goals,\u201d and instead continue to embed \u201cinclusion throughout our system.\u201d\n\nCostco, Apple and Microsoft have been notable exceptions \u2014 all rejecting NCPPR-led efforts to force them to reverse DEI.\n\nIn its Costco proposal, the NCPPR cited the 2023 Supreme Court case, demanding that the company conduct a financial risk analysis to determine if its DEI initiatives could make it a target for employment discrimination suits.\n\n\u201cWith 310,000 employees, Costco likely has at least 200,000 employees who are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight,\u201d the Washington, D.C.-based think tank had argued before the vote. \u201cAccordingly, even if only a fraction of those employees were to file suit, and only some of those prove successful, the cost to Costco could be tens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe NCPPR also noted that several state attorneys general had warned that Fair Admissions v. Harvard could leave companies open to discrimination lawsuits. In 2023, for example, Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey, in a letter to Fortune 100 CEOs , wrote that the Supreme Court decision \u201cshould place every employer and contractor on notice of the illegality of racial quotas and race-based preferences in employment and contracting practices.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Bailey urged companies to cease DEI programs: \u201cIf you choose not to do so, know that you will be held accountable\u2014sooner rather than later\u2014for your decision to continue treating people differently because of the color of their skin.\u201d\n\nIn an internal company report last updated in December, Costco said its non-management workforce was 44.2% white; 33.1% Hispanic; 9.3% Black and 8.5% Asian.\n\nThe report said: \u201cOur 11-member Board of Directors has four women and one person of color. For the company\u2019s U.S. officers (Assistant Vice President and above), 27.7% identify as women and 19.4% identify as a race or ethnicity other than White.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR",

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.\n\nAccording to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had submitted the proposal, arguing that Costco\u2019s DEI initiatives hold \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe think tank has made a similar proposal to Apple, and like some American companies that already scaled back or retreated from their diversity policies, cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nBut Costco\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion. The board said it believes \u201cour commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\u201d\n\nThe directors\u2019 message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \u201ccreativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\u201d and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.\n\nIn advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData\u2019s retail division, said Costco can be confident the proposal will be rejected.\n\n\u201cI think people generally have confidence in Costco\u2019s management, and there\u2019s an attitude of \u2018Why rock the boat? It\u2019s sailing very nicely,\u2019\u201d Saunders said.\n\nCostco\u2019s public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands, including Walmart,McDonald\u2019s and John Deere.\n\nLast week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation\u2019s largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company\u2019s DEI policies, a move they called \u201cdisheartening.\u201d\n\nProminent technology companies, including Amazon and Meta \u2014 the parent company of Facebook and Instagram \u2014 also have rolled back DEI initiatives, which are expected to face opposition from the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nEmboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThe plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.\n\nAs for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company\u2019s 300,000 employees worldwide \u201care potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\u201d If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.\n\nCostco has a chief diversity officer, but the company\u2019s executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco\u2019s management team typically stay a long time given the company\u2019s solid and stable financial performance.\n\nIn other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn\u2019t have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn\u2019t focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple\u2019s Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center\u2019s resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \u201cconsistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.\n\nApple\u2019s board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \u201cto create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank\u2019s DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\u201d he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cAnd wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.\n\n\u201cSo if you are an Apple or another company who\u2019s done that, and you\u2019re confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\u201d he said.",

That is well up from the $6.3 billion reported in 2023 and represents a 135% increase over 2018.\n\nTeamsters representatives said that Costco has refused to offer a contract that reflects this sizeable profit margin.\n\n\u201cJust the profits were $7.4 billion so we're not asking for all of it, we just want to get paid,\u201d said Paul Lowrie, a Costco fleet driver. \u201cWe just want to be up to industry standards. What everybody else makes in the area, we're definitely below.\"\n\nCostco Teamsters in Sumner and in other parts of the country recently held practice pickets to prepare for a possible strike. The Sumner Teamster members are fleet drivers who move goods from distribution centers to Costco warehouses, according to Teamsters Union Local 174.\n\nWorkers said they want a package that includes increases in pay and retirement benefits, but have not publicly said exactly how much more they want or what they are currently receiving.\n\nRELATED |\n\nKOMO News requested an interview with Costco officials and submitted a list of questions, but received a written statement that did not address many of the queries that were made.\n\n\"Costco is in negotiations with the Teamsters union regarding the renewal of a collective bargaining agreement that applies to less than 10% of Costco US locations. For several decades we\u2019ve had a good relationship with the union, and we are continuing to negotiate with them in good faith to renew the contract,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe have always treated our employees fairly and well throughout the history of our company. Claims the union makes or actions they may take are not expected to have a material impact on Costco\u2019s overall business.\"\n\nThomas Fellows, a workforce commentator, said the stage is set for a potentially critical confrontation between workers and one of the world's largest retailers.\n\n\u201cWith over 85% of union members voting in favor of authorizing the strike, this movement reflects a growing wave of labor activism targeting industry titans like Amazon and Starbucks,\u201d Fellows said. \u201cAt its core, this conflict is about accountability, fair treatment, and ensuring that workers\u2014the backbone of Costco's success\u2014receive their share of the company\u2019s immense wealth.\u201d\n\nFellows said the workers\u2019 demands for increased seniority pay, family leave, bereavement policies, and protections against surveillance are not unreasonable, and represent basic respect and dignity in the workplace. It underscores a growing tension in labor relations nationwide, where workers increasingly demand that corporate profits benefit those who generate them, Fellows continued.\n\nAs for the broader implications if Costco workers do strike, it could serve as \u201ca bellwether for the future of worker empowerment in an economy increasingly defined by inequality,\u201d Fellows said.\n\nDespite Costco's financial standing, Fellows said the company may not be in a position to dramatically boost compensation for its unionized drivers, which is about 8% of its overall workforce.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the average wage for Costco it's $31 per hour in the store, which is about 25% higher than your average retail salary,\u201d Fellows said. \u201cSo they might not be able to afford to do a significant increase in pay, particularly because they are already paying these workers 25% higher than your average retail chain.\"",

Ad\n\nThe Costco shopping experience is now a global phenomenon, with consumers now able to enjoy the wholesale chain's bulk-shopping discounts and $1.50 hot dogs across the U.S. and in places like Taiwan, Japan and Australia.\n\nThe company continues to shake up that experience, too. Not only does it manufacture many of its own goods under the Kirkland Signature brand, but two years ago, it began selling gold bars. And since the price of the precious metal hit its all-time high in October 2024, demand for the product offering has remained strong among members.\n\nIn fact, Costco\u2019s foray into precious metals has generated eye-popping results. The company is allegedly pulling in six figures in sales each month since its decision to begin selling gold, demonstrating that members have taken to buying gold bars alongside rotisserie chickens and bulk toilet paper. In its 2025 first-quarter report, Costco listed gold among its top sales categories. But for investors looking to gain exposure to the yellow metal, is this the best way?\n\nAds by Money.

The rollout has been so successful that in 2024, the company added silver coins and platinum bars to its offerings. But so far, its gold bars have been the clear winner.\n\nIn a note to clients, Wells Fargo analysts said they expect revenue from Costco's gold sales to fall between $100 million and $200 million monthly. The Swiss-made gold bars have repeatedly been selling out since they were first offered. However, this doesn't mean the venture is profitable for Costco. The store receives a low premium on gold purchases, and it offers cash back to certain buyers who use credit cards, meaning gold sales are not contributing to any significant uptick in profits.\n\nAs for investors, now is a good time to own gold. The price of the precious metal reached its all-time high of $2,781 per ounce last October. The principal drivers for gold's current bull run are twofold. First, the surge in gold prices can be partially attributed to the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Gold historically has an inverse relationship with interest rates, and with the Fed cutting rates throughout the second half of last year, investors saw the precious metal's price surge.\n\nThe second factor that has been propelling gold prices is a combination of weak consumer confidence and lingering inflation. With headline inflation creeping up to 2.9% in December, purchasing power continues to be eroded, which drives investors to seek out safe-haven assets, of which gold is the frontrunner as a liquid store of value.\n\nIs buying gold from Costco a good idea?\n\nConsumers can now hop in their cars and drive to the nearest Costco location to purchase gold. But is it a good idea? It's a convenient option for those interested in investing in gold long term. But if investors choose to buy the precious metal at the discount warehouse, there are pros and cons they should be aware of. Some incentives Costco offers may up the ante, but you\u2019d be lacking the peace of mind afforded by buying gold in a brokerage account and holding it in a portfolio.\n\nFirst, Costco gold buyers will have to pay a mark-up on their bars. Known as the spread, the stores charge 2% above the current market rate. This isn\u2019t abnormal, though. Online gold dealers also charge a spread for their non-wholesale transactions. Costco\u2019s premium falls within the industry range making it no worse a deal.\n\nWith the bonuses Costco offers on precious metal purchases, in fact, some buyers may effectively eliminate the premium. Those who buy their bars at the store using Citigroup credit cards are eligible for 2% cash back on their purchase. Executive members at Costco can receive an additional 2% cash back.\n\nOn the other hand, Costco does not afford its members any opportunities to purchase gold in bulk. When it has the metal in stock, buyers are limited to five bars per transaction. So, if investors are looking to stockpile any significant quantity of the metal, they\u2019ll need to go through a precious metals dealer.\n\nBuying gold at Costco also means experiencing the same pitfalls as those who purchase the physical metal from online dealers. These drawbacks are avoided for investors who purchase gold on paper, though. Once gold is purchased at Costco, the consumer is then responsible for its safekeeping. It\u2019s a scenario not unlike stuffing cash in a mattress, and it carries risk. To avoid that, the gold can be insured and stored in a vault, but these are additional expenses.\n\nConversely, paper gold investments \u2014 like owning shares of a gold ETF, which can be anchored by physical gold held in insured vaults \u2014 provide investors with that same peace of mind without having to pay extra for it. These investments are also more liquid than physical gold, meaning they're easier to buy and sell since they're listed on exchanges. Some gold ETFs even pay dividends, meaning they can play a role in a strategy aimed at generating passive income while also benefiting from the price strength of the underlying commodity.\n\nAll said, buying gold from Costco isn\u2019t any worse than buying it from a dealer if you don\u2019t mind the purchase limit. It could be better than buying from a gold dealer in some instances, since you don\u2019t need to worry about potential scams and salesmanship, and you can earn as much as 4% cash back. However, there are still options to invest in gold that offer greater safety, higher liquidity and less hassle than holding onto the bars yourself.\n\nThis story, originally published in April 2024, was updated in January 2025 to reflect current gold prices, inflation rates and Costco's additional precious metal offerings.\n\nAds by Money.

It is important that they all feel included and appreciated and that they transmit these values to our customers,\" James said.\n\nEthan Peck from the National Center for Public Policy Research \u2013 the right-leaning shareholder advocacy group that submitted the proposal \u2013 argued in a prerecorded message that DEI is \"illegal, immoral and detrimental to shareholder value\" and poses litigation risks for the company.\n\n\"By not hiring and promoting completely irrespective of race and sex \u2012 in other words, by merit alone \u2012 the company is not always hiring or promoting the best person for the job, and anything short of that is selling the success in the future of the company short, and therefore selling shareholders short,\" the message said.\n\nThe vote came just days after President Donald Trump used executive power to crack down on DEI.\n\nIncreasingly, companies are facing a DEI showdown at the shareholder ballot box.\n\nApple recently recommended investors vote against a shareholder proposal to eliminate the company\u2019s DEI programs.\n\nRight-leaning groups like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center say they bring shareholder proposals to counter liberal politics invading corporate boardrooms and advancing a \u201cwoke\u201d ideological agenda that puts businesses at risk.\n\nSeizing on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision striking down affirmative action in college admissions to challenge corporate diversity policies, these groups are bringing more DEI-related proposals before investors.\n\nWhile small, the number of anti-DEI shareholder proposals has more than tripled since 2020, according to the Conference Board. This proxy season, Walmart and Starbucks face similar proposals.\n\nPeck, deputy director of the National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, said his group plans 40 shareholder proposals this year, 12 focused on DEI.\n\n\u201cOur shareholder proposal efforts are very much in tandem with the general pushback against DEI, in that both the general pushback and our proposals are about exposing how DEI is discriminatory and value-destroying,\u201d he told USA TODAY.\n\nRight-leaning investors advance shareholder proposals \u2013 even those likely to get low-single-digit support \u2013 to make a point and get attention. Like Costco, corporate boards usually recommend shareholders vote against them. The measures typically get less than 2% of shareholder support.\n\nTrump's DEI executive orders increase business risks\n\nSpeaking to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday, Trump called DEI programs \"absolute nonsense.\"\n\nHis latest executive order to end DEI in the federal government and affirmative action in federal contracting sent shockwaves through corporate America. Trump said his administration would investigate corporations that don\u2019t fall in line. That warning could fuel more shareholder activism over the potential legal and financial fallout from diversity initiatives.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is one of the companies that may become a target.\n\nWhen asked about a potential challenge to its DEI practices, CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box: \u201cBring them on,\u201d though he said he would listen to arguments about where JPMorgan Chase is getting it wrong \u201cand make modifications.\u201d\n\nFacing a rapidly shifting political environment and under fire from conservative foundations, think tanks and political operatives, a growing list of major corporations have dialed back diversity efforts.\n\nSome companies retreated from DEI commitments shortly before Trump took office. Among them was Facebook and Instagram owner Meta as CEO Mark Zuckerberg looked to align his social media company with the Trump administration.\n\nCostco, Apple and others reject anti-DEI shareholder proposals\n\nThose rollbacks have critics who say companies are making shortsighted decisions that could undermine their businesses.\n\nAmong them is the progressive shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, which issued a 2023 report showing a \u201cstatistically significant correlation\u201d between diverse management and eight key financial metrics.\n\n\u201cThese are businesses that have existed longer than four years. We expect them to exist beyond this four-year window in front of us,\u201d said Meredith Benton, principal founder of Whistle Stop Capital, which consults with As You Sow on DEI. \u201cWhat we want to see is them making decisions that are in their business interests over the long term.\u201d\n\nSome companies are standing by their DEI programs. None have defended those programs quite as vigorously as Costco.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research submitted the shareholder proposal, arguing that Costco\u2019s DEI initiatives hold \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to recommend shareholders reject the measure, arguing that diverse employees and suppliers fuel innovation in the merchandise it stocks and the services it offers.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d the directors said. \u201cThe report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\u201d\n\nCostco CEO Ron Vachris also defended those practices to a concerned shareholder, saying his company does not use hiring quotas but focuses on giving all workers the same opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf these are the policies you see as offensive, I must tell you I am not prepared to change,\u201d Vachris wrote in the exchange viewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStefan Padfield, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, said Costco\u2019s \u201cdefiant\u201d response to a \u201cperfectly reasonable shareholder request\u201d was out of line.\n\n\u201cSimply asking shareholders to trust the status quo at Costco is insufficient,\u201d Padfield told USA TODAY. \u201cThis is a rapidly changing landscape in terms of law, regulation, and market sentiment, and shareholders accordingly have good reason to ask for a review of practices, legal advice, and managerial information gathering and processing.\u201d",

The company is on track to open six new warehouses in California, Texas and Michigan this year, which will help Costco surpass 900 stores worldwide.\n\nEugene\u2019s Costco is located at 2828 Chad Drive and has been open since Nov. 1989.\n\nTeamsters unions have a presence in Eugene, particularly now as drivers are still on strike against Bigfoot Beverages, but it does not appear that the Eugene Costco is a unionized location.\n\nWhile a strike is authorized, it may not happen if the bargaining parties can reach an agreement before Jan. 31. Should Costco Teamsters strike, it would begin Feb. 1. Teamsters said hundreds of its Costco workers organized practice pickets last week to prepare for a potential strike in locations such as Hayward and San Diego, California; Sumner, Washington; and Long Island, New York.\n\nHannarose McGuinness is The Register-Guard\u2019s growth and development reporter.

Famously, the store\u2019s hot dog and soda deal has been only $1.50 since 1984!\n\nLike the Costco hot dog, other food court menu items have a cult following. Customers used to love Costco churros, but for some reason, the original treat is no longer available. Members were shocked when Costco discontinued the churros, but then again, we aren\u2019t immune to controversial food court decisions. I decided to find a replacement to satisfy our cravings.\n\nWhy did Costco get rid of churros?\n\nFor years, cinnamon sugar-coated churros were a staple at the Costco food court. The traditional straight churros sold for $1. For unknown reasons, they were removed from the menu during the pandemic, much to the chagrin of loyal customers. Costco eventually brought back churros, but this time with a twist\u2014literally. The \u201ctwisted\u201d churros arrived on the menu in 2021 but didn\u2019t last long. In early 2024, churros disappeared from the menu completely. Their sweet slot was filled with a giant chocolate chip cookie for $2.49.\n\nWhere do I find copycat Costco churros?\n\nKristina Vanni for Taste of Home\n\nSince the churros disappeared from the Costco menu, members have been searching for an alternative. Some say that the brand Costco used on its menu was from a company called Tio Pepes, and could be purchased in bulk from Walmart or Amazon. However, since they come in a case of 100, you would need a lot of freezer space for this option. I scoured the freezer sections at Costco, Trader Joe\u2019s and Aldi, looking for a more convenient solution. All three stores said they had frozen churros at one point or another but didn\u2019t currently have any in stock.\n\nLuckily, one non-chain grocery store near me carries the Goya brand of frozen churros. I bought a box, put them in a 400\u00b0F oven for five minutes and tossed the hot churros with the included cinnamon sugar packet. If you have a local grocery store that carries Goya churros, it\u2019s a good option when a Costco churro craving hits.\n\nOn our quest to find a replacement for the Costco churros, one unlikely source came into the picture. Subway recently introduced a new Footlong menu for snacking under $5. It includes a 12-inch cookie, a pretzel and\u2026a churro! Ultimately, this was the best replacement for our beloved Costco churros. Being on the Footlong menu, the churros are oversized, exactly like what we were used to at Costco. The only caveat is that Subway churros cost $2, twice as much as the beloved Costco original.",

On Wednesday, Mr. Starbuck said on social media that D.E.I. was \u201ccornered and in a position to die but we must be punishing and relentless in finishing this ideology off.\u201d\n\nShareholder proposals have become a popular way for corporate activists to contest and support diversity efforts, climate commitments and other social issues. But compared with social media attacks, they have so far yielded few results. Companies including Lowe\u2019s, Molson Coors and Toyota announced changes to their policies after Mr. Starbuck targeted them on social media (\u201cWe\u2019ll eventually get to Costco,\u201d Mr. Starbuck wrote on X, but they \u201cwere not a company we had down to work on in early 2025.\u201d).

            "content": "Is Costco stock the key to long-term wealth? Let's take a good look at this great retailer.\n\nInvesting can make you rich. You don't even have to beat the market.\n\nSimply trusting your spare cash to an index fund with entirely average long-term returns is more than enough to double your money in 10 years. If you also reinvest dividend in more shares along the way, a fund mirroring the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%) index can boost your gains to 10.6% a year. That's a total return of 174% per decade, on average. Keep that up for a while, and add more cash over time, and you'll eventually have a pretty nice nest egg.\n\nA handful of specific stocks can do the same thing, but that's a tricky idea. No matter how well-run or well-planned a business might be, there is no such thing as a risk-free stock. Building sustainable wealth requires many years and even decades of success. Wall Street is littered with the remains of once-great companies and stocks that had a moment in the sun but couldn't stick around in the long run.\n\nSo I can't recommend betting your life savings on warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%), but this stock could be a solid cornerstone in a diversified portfolio.\n\nCostco's business mojo\n\nAs of January 2025, you won't find another discount store or grocery chain that can match Costco's return on assets (ROA). This company can do more with a dollar's worth of funds and equipment than any retailer in its class.\n\nThe company also boasts world class return on equity (ROE), which makes it a great steward of shareholder investments, too.\n\nIts gross profit margin isn't great, but Costco still collects generous bottom-line earnings. You see, the profit margin on goods sold in its stores is famously slim. Most of the earnings spring from the warehouse club membership program.\n\nCostco's recipe for success\n\nSome discount retailers make up for their low in-store prices by pinching every possible penny in the supply chain. Minimum-wage paychecks are common, along with minimal employee benefit programs. Store brands are rarely great in this sub-sector, since low prices often take priority over product quality.\n\nCostco is different.\n\nThe company is famous for paying a living wage with solid health plans and other uncommon benefits. The Kirkland store brand often compares favorably to leading brands in each category, and Costco may have sourced their stuff from the same factories.\n\nAs a result, Costco's workers tend to be happy there. That's one way to guarantee better service and fewer employee relations missteps. The focus on quality over price also results in satisfied customers, and there is less pressure on the procurement department to build a cheap supply chain.\n\nAnd the membership program more than makes up for Costco's modest margins at the top of the income statement. Costco reported $7.4 billion of net income in fiscal year 2024. At the same time, the company collected $4.8 billion of membership fees from its 76.2 million households. That's a nearly costless revenue stream, accounting for about 65% of Costco's total earnings.\n\nIs Costco's stock worth a splurge?\n\nNow, Costco's stock isn't as affordable as its Kirkland hot dogs. The stock price has seen a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 27% over the last five years, breezing past Walmart's (WMT -0.82%) 20.6% CAGR and even Amazon's (AMZN -2.51%) 18.7% yearly return. Pick your favorite valuation ratio and chances are high that Costco's stock looks more expensive than Walmart or Amazon through that lens.\n\nIn other words, Costco's business quality is no secret. Investors are paying a premium for this stock. The company has arguably earned this luxury the hard way, but you still have to be comfortable with lofty valuations before buying the stock today.\n\nGreat company, tricky timing\n\nCostco is a great company and a worthy addition to any long-term investment portfolio. However, this may not be the best time ever to pick up Costco shares. It's alright if you already have an automated Costco investment set up, since you're taking an active part in the market.\n\nBut if you don't, I would suggest looking elsewhere for stocks that can set you up for life. Costco may find its way back to that discussion someday, either through years of stellar results or a quick price correction. It just isn't on that list for me right now.",

Besides top-grade tools and quality gear, Costco has something else on the table that you might not have realized: outdoor sheds. That includes the \u201cHaven\u201d barn, which is pretty popular at the moment. This particular unit is specifically made by Gorilla, which specializes in building sheds with premium-grade lumber from licensed and trained professionals.\n\nNote: If you are not a Costco member or prefer to shop elsewhere, keep reading. Our preferred choices on sheds from Amazon and other retailers are listed as product buttons throughout the story for your shopping convenience.\n\nThe Haven barn is made in the U.S. by installers who just get it: The shed has an abundance of shelves and a storage loft, great for stashing all of your tools, equipment, and gear. It\u2019s styled with a barn roof, allowing additional stowing above. With two wall vents, you can count on air circulating throughout the unit in cold and warm weather. The high-top windows make for excellent lighting, and the extra-wide 64-inch double doors are also a plus, meaning that you can fit in larger items (like lawnmowers, trash bins, etc.). Trust that it could support these items, too, with its LP ProStruct flooring made for holding heavy material. Whether you need extra storage space, a new man cave, a mudroom, or whatever, this shed has all the necessary chops.\n\nThe Haven shed is available in 10x10 or 12x16 sizes, priced at $4,000 and $6,000, respectively. Now might also be a good time to highlight that anything bought from Gorilla through Costco comes with a free installation service.\n\n\n\nFor some, that price still might be hefty. Others might not even have a Costco membership. Either way, that\u2019s alright. If the Haven piqued your interest, it\u2019s worth noting that there are plenty of similar bar sheds (in both style and build) available on retailers like Amazon and .\n\nTake the , for example. This sturdy model can fit all of your go-to equipment and then some. It\u2019s a great way to store your rideable lawn mower (or your standard push), pool toys, or even your snowblower. You\u2019ll have leeway with the interior design, so if you wanted this to be tool-heavy, so be it.\n\nHowever, with the option to have this shed come with or without a floor, you could also make this anything you want. Indoor playhouse for your kids? Not a problem. Need multiple levels of shelves for stashing items? This unit is ladder-friendly. The Braymore shed is also great for either season. Store your machinery inside so that you don\u2019t want it getting wet or withered by the weather, either from the winter snow or the summer sun.\n\nWe found great finds that are similar to Costco\u2019s Haven barn shed and Amazon\u2019s Braymore shed. It all just depends on what your needs and wants are, but make sure to check out the options below.",

The Teamsters are demanding the strongest possible contract and are prepared to strike if the company fails to deliver.\n\nEarlier this week, Costco Teamsters across the country voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if an acceptable agreement isn\u2019t reached by the January 31 deadline. The Costco Teamsters National Master Agreement covers over 18,000 workers nationwide. Workers are demanding an industry-leading contract that matches Costco\u2019s record-breaking profits and holds the company accountable for its so-called \u201cpro-worker\u201d reputation.\n\nCostco is more profitable than ever. In 2024, the company reported $254 billion in revenue and $7.4 billion in net profits \u2013 a dramatic increase from $6.3 billion in 2023 and a 135 percent jump from 2018. Yet instead of delivering a contract that rewards the workers who make its success possible, Costco has so far refused to offer a contract that reflects its massive profit margin.\n\nWHAT: Costco Teamsters Rally\n\nWHEN: Thursday, January 23, 2025, 1:30 p.m. \u2013 3:00 p.m. PST\n\nWHO: Costco rank-and-file Teamsters\n\nWHERE: Costco Corporate Headquarters \u2014 999 Lake Dr, Issaquah, WA 98027",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCostco Teamsters voted by an 85% margin to authorize a strike, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Monday. Costco didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA master agreement that covers more than 18,000 Costco workers expires Jan. 31 and workers are prepared to strike the following day, according to a union press release.\n\nLast week hundreds of Costco Teamsters in California, Washington and New York held practice pickets to prepare for a potential strike, the union said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAbout a year ago when its Norfolk, Virginia, store voted to join the Teamsters, Costco\u2019s leadership \u2014 its incoming and outgoing chief executives \u2014 accepted responsibility and said the vote reflected a failure on their part.\n\n\u201cAt Costco, we take great pride in our relationships with each other. We\u2019re not anti-union, but our core value of \u2018taking care of our employees\u2019 has never been the result of any union,\u201d then-outgoing CEO Craig Jelinek and incoming CEO Ron Vachris wrote in a letter to their U.S. employees, which was posted on social media.\n\nCostco, which offers some of the best pay and benefits in the retail industry, enjoys a reputation as a good place to work. Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, addressed that in a statement regarding the impending strike.\n\n\"This strike vote is a direct response to Costco's greed and blatant disregard for the bargaining process,\" Erickson said. \"Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it's failing to live up to that reputation. Management has less than two weeks to fix this \u2014 if they don't, they'll face the consequences.\"\n\nThe Teamsters characterized the membership-based warehouse retailer\u2019s financial performance as \u201crecord-breaking profits.\u201d The company last month said that its most recent quarter was its best since 2023. In the period, global net sales rose 7.5% year over year to $61 billion, with U.S. comps excluding fuel up more than 7% and net income up more than 13% to $1.8 billion.\n\nIn a statement, Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien called for \u201ca historic, industry-leading agreement.\u201d\n\n\"Our members have spoken loud and clear \u2014 Costco must deliver a fair contract, or they'll be held accountable,\" he said. \u201cCostco's greedy executives have less than two weeks to do the right thing. If they refuse, they'll have no one to blame but themselves when our members go on strike.\"\n\nCostco recently pushed back against a shareholder demand to dismantle its diversity goals in a response that was notable for its forcefulness, observers said. In the past, the company has similarly defended its relatively higher compensation packages as ultimately good for business.",

The vote is a direct result of the company\u2019s continued failure to bargain constructively and refusal to present a fair contract offer that reflects the company\u2019s record-breaking profits.

            "content": "The baking aisle at Costco is a treasure trove for anyone passionate about making homemade goodies. You can stock up on big bags of flour, sugar and chocolate chips, all at a great price. Hiding about halfway down this aisle is the biggest steal of them all, an impressive 16-ounce bottle of pure vanilla extract that sells for only $9.99.\n\nSince we go through extract like water in my house, the Costco vanilla has been one of the best perks of membership for us!\n\nHow does the vanilla compare to more expensive brands?\n\nFirst of all, the Costco vanilla is pure vanilla extract, not imitation vanilla. I was suspicious, given the price tag. Finding the real deal is hurdle number one when I\u2019m buying vanilla, and accidentally buying imitation is a common vanilla mistake. The imitation stuff is much cheaper than the real thing, but it has the quality to match.\n\nI scrutinized the label and determined that Costco vanilla is pure vanilla extract. Usually, if I want the best of the best vanilla extract, I swallow the cost of Nielsen-Massey vanilla. However, a bottle of this liquid gold costs upward of $37 for only 8 ounces, half the amount of extract that Costco sells. I still keep a bottle of Nielsen-Massey for extra special desserts, but it\u2019s simply too expensive for everyday use. I needed an extract that was nearly as good but less expensive, so I brought the Costco vanilla home for a taste test.\n\nUpon opening the bottle, the aroma immediately impressed me. It was rich and smooth, exactly what bakers look for to take any recipe to the next level. The label doesn\u2019t specify what type of vanilla is used to make this extract. It simply says that it is extracted and bottled in the U.S. using imported vanilla beans.\n\nAfter using this extract in cookies, cakes and homemade ice cream, I am convinced that ounce-for-ounce, this product is the best value for pure vanilla extract. The flavor is complex without an artificial aftertaste. For anyone who is a frequent baker but can\u2019t stomach the price tag of fancy brands, Costco vanilla is for you. I have a new-ish bottle with a best-by date of 2029, so your purchase will last quite a while.\n\nIs the vanilla always at Costco?\n\nFor as long as I have been a member, this vanilla has always been on the shelf at Costco. While it doesn\u2019t have Kirkland Signature branding, it is distributed by the Costco Wholesale Corporation in Washington state. That gives me hope that this Costco staple will be available for many years to come.",

In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected union proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment on the strike vote.\n\nThe Teamsters covered by the Costco national contract make up 8% of the 219,000 US employees that the company has at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers it represents a major strike for a US retailer, which is overwhelmingly nonunion. Labor Department statistics show less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most are in the grocery store sector.\n\nThe Teamsters staged a strike at Amazon just before Christmas, but unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate with the Teamsters, let alone reach a contract. It doesn\u2019t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services who have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees. The workers at Amazon who went on strike returned to work the day after Christmas.\n\nThe strike authorization vote does not mean there will be a strike. Strike authorization votes are a common tactic used by unions ahead of a contract expiration. And the overwhelming majority of workers generally authorize a strike in those votes. In June 2023 97% of Teamsters voted to authorize a strike at UPS, the union\u2019s largest employer. But two weeks before that strike deadline the union reached a labor deal that averted at strike at UPS.",

That's true when owning stocks for the very long term, as uninterrupted compounding can work its magic.\n\nFew businesses have done this better than Costco (COST -3.93%). In the past 20 years, the warehouse club operator has generated a total return of 2,730% (as of Jan. 16). Putting $1,000 into shares back then would be worth over $28,000 today.\n\nAfter such a phenomenal return since January 2005, is it too late to buy this top retail stock now?\n\nRetail powerhouse\n\nCostco's success over the years is impressive. The business today is undeniably a retail powerhouse, raking in a whopping $250 billion in net sales in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1). Only Walmart and Amazon are bigger retailers.\n\nThat scale provides Costco with cost advantages. The company's warehouses typically carry 4,000 different stock-keeping units, while other supermarkets sell about 30,000. This means that Costco is buying massive quantities of a limited number of goods, which gives it bargaining power with its suppliers. These vendors have no choice but to play ball. Otherwise, they will lose a huge revenue generator.\n\nIt creates a positive feedback loop. Higher merchandise sales result in more buying power and negotiating leverage over suppliers, which lead to low costs and ongoing savings for shoppers, who are then inclined to spend more money at Costco. This supports the company's strong competitive position.\n\nCustomer focus\n\nManagement's top focus hasn't changed at all. Selling quality merchandise at extremely low prices was the priority 20 years ago. And it's true today. The beauty of this business model is that Costco benefits from durable demand trends, making it resilient to economic pressures.\n\nIn the last five years, there's been a global pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, surging inflation, and rapidly rising interest rates. What's more, geopolitical tension and political uncertainty seem to always be concerns.\n\nHowever, this didn't prevent Costco from thriving. Revenue increased 67% between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024. And Wall Street analysts see the top line rising 22% over the next three years, a slower but still healthy outlook.\n\nThe ability to be successful no matter what's going on with the macropicture certainly reduces risk for shareholders, as there is almost no reason to worry that Costco's demand will ever take a hit.\n\nBest course of action\n\nIn the past two decades, the S&P 500 has generated a total return of 642%. Costco's gain is four times greater. Clearly, the retailer's longtime shareholders have gotten very wealthy.\n\nIt's critical to view the stock with a fresh perspective today. In particular, the valuation deserves a closer look. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 54.2, close to the highest level ever.\n\nViewed through any lens, this valuation is extremely expensive. Investors should prioritize having a margin of safety before buying a stock, as it provides a cushion in case your analysis about a business and its trajectory is off. It's easy to argue that Costco doesn't fit the bill, making it a very risky stock to buy right now, no matter how high quality the company is.\n\nIn my opinion, it is too late to buy Costco stock. The returns going forward aren't going to come close to resembling what was achieved in the past. That's especially true given the current valuation, which implies monster earnings growth in the future, something I don't believe will happen.\n\nBut not all hope is lost. Here's where having patience is valuable. Investors should follow the company and wait for a meaningful pullback. Perhaps if shares get to a P/E ratio of 30 or below, then they're a no-brainer buy. It's anyone's guess if this will ever happen, though.",

            "content": "Members of the Teamsters union have authorized a strike against popular US retailer Costco next month as a pre-emptive bargaining-position ahead of the expiration of a work contract for 18,000 company workers.\n\nIf a strike goes ahead, 56 of the company\u2019s warehouse stores across five states would be affected after 85% of Teamster members voted to authorize the action over wages and benefits.\n\nThe Teamsters said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance. The union represents around 8% of Costco\u2019s 219,000, mostly un-unionized, employees.\n\nCostco has also bucked a trend for large US employers to roll back diversity efforts and said such efforts contribute to innovation and to its bottom line. Employee diversity, the Costco board has said, promotes \u201cthe \u2018treasure hunt\u2019 that our customers value.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d it added.\n\nLast month, the Teamsters union staged a strike at Amazon. In that dispute, the online retailer does not recognize the union, or recognize union-represented delivery drivers as employees and has refused to negotiate.\n\nBut the strike authorization doesn\u2019t mean there will be a strike. The Teamsters union declined to endorse Trump or Kamala Harris for president ahead of November\u2019s election, saying neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3m member union.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,\u201d said Sean O\u2019Brien, the Teamsters president.\n\nTrump called the Teamsters\u2019 decision not to endorse \u201ca great honor\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to endorse the Democrats. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\n\nBut the threat of a strike comes as unions, which represent 10% of US workers, according to the bureau of labor statistics, anticipate changes under Donald Trump\u2019s administration after four years of union support under Joe Biden.\n\nAmong the major changes in policy that workers could expect under the Trump administration, according to the Economic Policy Institute, are an end to proactive government support for the right to form a union, crackdowns on immigrants in the workplace, and a rollback of pro-worker laws that gives employers more power.\n\nTrump has nominated Oregon Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer for secretary of labor. The former congresswoman is one of three Republicans who have backed the right to organize and could enact a pro-worker agenda.\n\nLiz Shuler, the AFL-CIO president, praised Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s \u201cpro-labor record in Congress\u201d, but said \u201cit remains to be seen what she will be permitted to do as secretary of labor in an administration with a dramatically anti-worker agenda\u201d.",

If they refuse, they'll have no one to blame but themselves when our members go on strike.\"\n\nThe union says \"fair wages and benefits\" are the catalyst for the strike.\n\nAccording to the union, the wholesale giant recently reported $254 billion in annual revenue and $7.4 billion in net profits, which marked a 135% increase since 2018.\n\n\"Yet, despite these record gains, the company refuses to meet the Teamsters' demands for fair wages and benefits that reflect the company's enormous success,\" the union said.\n\nIn preparation for the strike, last week hundreds of Costco Teamsters nationwide organized practice pickets from Hayward, California, to Sumner, Washington, and Long Island, New York.\n\n\"We are the backbone of Costco,\" Bryan Fields, a Costco worker in Baltimore and member of Teamsters Local 570 said in the press release. \"We drive its success and generate its profits. We hope the company will step up and do right by us, but if they don't, that's on them. The company will be striking itself.\"",

Molten cake, key lime pie, New York cheesecake, and panna cotta are some of the top ones that come to mind. However, it\u2019s hard not to notice that a slice of pie or cake typically costs close to $10 each, and if you\u2019re looking to share with a crowd, that can add up pretty quickly.\n\nThankfully, Costco Bakery always has a supply of affordable, ready-to-devour desserts in bulk. Everything, from its Maple Butter Pecan Bar Layer Cake to its 24-count Cannoli Kit helps feed our sweet tooth\u2014and it feeds well.\n\nCostco\u2019s latest dessert is just that and then some, and if you\u2019re a lover of all sweet things like us, you\u2019ll want to hear all about it.\n\nCostco\u2019s Massive Tub of Tiramisu\n\nA Costco fan recently shared on Instagram that the warehouse now carries tiramisu in an \u201cabsurdly huge tub of perfection.\" It is so good that \"once you start, it\u2019s nearly impossible to stop,\" she writes. In fact, it's so incredible that she believes it'll \u201ccompletely ruin fancy tiramisu for you.\u201d\n\nShe's not alone in that sentiment.

Once our excitement calmed, we noticed that this post came from Canada. We searched high and low online to see if anyone else had been chatting about this latest find in the U.S. but unfortunately, it seems the only tiramisu offered here comes in a smaller portion. We're afraid this item may be yet another delicious find that is only available to Costco members in Canada\u2014at least for now.\n\nLuckily, some fans shared on the post that there is a Sam\u2019s Club version available in the U.S. that looks similar to what we're seeing from our Canadian friends. It's sold in a big ol' 2-pound tub, and members are saying, \u201cit's fire\u201d and you \u201cabsolutely need to try\u201d it.\n\nWe\u2019re crossing our fingers for Costco\u2019s tiramisu to hit local stores soon, but until then, at least we have other options.\n\n",

Plans are inching forward\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Family of fallen veteran makes gift in his honor Tammy Ludwig, the mother of Zach Ludwig, a U.S. Marine from 2007 to 2011, participates in a check presentation event Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2024, for Warrior Homes of Collier.\n\nPlans for a new Costco in Southeast Naples are quietly inching ahead.\n\nWhile Costco has yet to confirm its interest, it has two companion petitions working their way through Collier County's development review and approval process.\n\nUltimately, both petitions will require approval from a county hearing examiner.\n\nOne request is for an insubstantial change to a planned unit development. The other is for a waiver to the separation requirements for gas stations.\n\n\"Neither can be approved without the other\u2019s approval,\" said Sean Sammon, the county planner assigned to the project.\n\nIt appears the project will not require approval by the Collier County commission. That's because gas stations and general merchandise stores are already allowed within the Hacienda Lakes PUD where the land sits.\n\nThe location is a forested site at the corner of Collier Boulevard and Rattlesnake Snake Hammock Road.\n\nA map of the area on LoopNet, a commercial real estate website, even shows a Costco as \"coming soon.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, several Costco representatives, including a director of real estate development, had their first meeting with county staff about the project, creating a buzz \u2013 after word leaked.\n\nAfter months of inactivity, following the pre-application meeting, however, some thought Costco might have changed its mind.\n\nA site plan for the building still has not been submitted to the county.\n\nA spokesperson for Costco could not immediately be reached for comment. On its website, the company says it does not comment on locations that will be \"opening more than three months from today.\"\n\nIt has announced six new locations scheduled to open in early 2025.\n\nMore: Costco opening new store locations in early 2025: See the list of warehouses\n\nA preliminary plan provided to Collier County shows a project that fits Costco's mold: A roughly 158,000-square-foot store, with 850 parking spaces, and an adjacent gas station, on nearly 20 acres. The larger site \u2013 at 8392 Collier Blvd. \u2013 includes four outparcels.\n\nCostco filed its other two petitions in October, starting the county's internal review process. A second review of both requests should be completed by Feb. 12, Sammon said.\n\nMeanwhile, a neighborhood meeting about the project is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 18, \"subject to change,\" he said.\n\nThat meeting is required before the petitions can go before the hearing examiner. An independent hearing examiner typically hears smaller land use matters in the county, listening to all sides, considering the evidence presented and then making decisions based on fact and law.\n\n\"If both petitions\u2019 reviews are approved, earliest hearing this may be scheduled for would be mid-March, but it\u2019s all still to be determined,\" Sammon said.\n\nThere is a 7 Eleven gas station roughly 130 feet from the proposed Costco. The county's land development code requires a 500-foot separation between service stations, which is why a waiver is necessary.\n\nThe approval of an insubstantial change to the PUD is needed to allow for alternative architectural standards, different from what the community and the land development code require.\n\nCostco's requested relief includes exceptions to architectural glazing standards, massing and light fixture heights, as well as to landscaping and sign requirements.\n\nIn a recent update to Collier County Commissioner Rick LoCastro via email, Jamie French, head of the county's Growth Management and Community Development Department, shared the status of the retailer's two petitions that are making their way through the review process.\n\nWhile not yet filed, a petition for site plan approval would typically be handled at the \"administrative level,\" anyway, he noted.\n\nGoing forward, French promised to provide monthly updates to LoCastro. The project sits in the commissioner's district, and he's heard from neighbors who are both for and against it.\n\n\"I continue to follow Costco's 'request' for construction closely,\" he said.\n\nIn his mind, next steps are still uncertain.\n\n\"The way forward 'depends' on what they turn in to the county, any variances they 'might' ask for (or not) ... and many other factors,\" LoCastro said.\n\nRob Carroll, a commercial leasing and sales agent for IPC in Naples, said he's not at all surprised to see Costco moving ahead.\n\n\"I think they will be able to capture the south Naples and Marco market from there,\" he said of the site.\n\nThe location would be a second for Costco in Collier County. Its only warehouse club in the county, off Naples Boulevard, north of Pine Ridge Road and west of Airport-Pulling Road, opened in 1999.",

Weekdays, especially Tuesday through Thursday, tend to be less crowded than weekends.\n\nAdditionally, arriving early in the morning or close to closing time can offer a more relaxed atmosphere and shorter lines.\n\nSamples Are Unlimited\n\nYes, unlimited. We all know that Costco is famous for its generous sampling stations, allowing you to try out various products before making a purchase.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what our insider tells us is that you can have as many as you want. To get the most out of the samples, plan your visit around mealtimes (especially lunch) when there tend to be more stations set up.\n\nFor You: The Best $20 You Can Spend at Trader Joe\u2019s This Winter\n\nThere\u2019s More Than Meets the Eye With Kirkland Signature Brands\n\nCostco\u2019s Kirkland Signature brand is known for its quality and value. But what a lot of people don\u2019t know according to our insider is that many Kirkland products are manufactured by reputable brands, often sold under different labels at higher prices. Be sure to compare prices and consider opting for Kirkland Signature products.\n\nCostco Expects You To Make Impulse Buys\n\nWith its massive selection, attractive displays and enticing end-of-aisle deals, it\u2019s easy to get carried away at Costco. And, according to our in-the-know employee, the store is set up like that for a reason.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, there are ways to combat that: Before making a purchase, ask yourself if you truly need the item or if it\u2019s simply an impulsive buy. Stick to your shopping list to avoid overspending.\n\nThey Have Bunch of Unique Services\n\nIn addition to bulk products, Costco offers a range of services, including travel arrangements, insurance, prescription medications and even discounted movie tickets. Take advantage of these services to maximize the value of your membership.\n\nUse the Costco App\n\nThe Costco app is a game-changer for shoppers that not a lot of people are taking advantage of, according to our insider.\n\nFirst off, it makes shopping super convenient, letting you browse and buy from wherever you are. Plus, you get exclusive deals and offers that are just for app users. And check this out, you can even use Apple Pay or Google Pay for a smooth checkout experience.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay goodbye to carrying around a physical membership card because the app hooks you up with a digital version. Need to find a Costco nearby? No problem, the app\u2019s got your back with store locator and hours. Oh, and if you\u2019ve got some favorite items that you always buy, the app makes reordering a breeze.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the pharmacy services and prescription refills too.\n\nPay Attention to the Numbers\n\nAs per our confidential source, Costco typically assigns a price ending in .97 to items that are heavily discounted. These discounts are consistent nationwide.\n\nHowever, products with prices ending in .00 are specific to local markdowns and may vary in different regions. Such markdowns are typically initiated by managers to swiftly clear inventory.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrices ending in a 9 indicate exclusive manufacturer deals, offering exceptional bargains.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget the Asterisk\n\nCostco marks some items with an asterisk (*) to indicate they won\u2019t be restocked once sold out. If you see an item you love with an asterisk, stock up while you can.\n\nYes, Costco Has a Coupon Book\n\nOur source tells us that Costco releases a monthly coupon book filled with mega-deals on tons of items. Keep an eye out for it and plan your shopping accordingly.\n\nBonus: You can combine these coupons with existing discounts and save even more.\n\nCostco\u2019s Return Policy Is Extremely Generous\n\nWhat many people don\u2019t know is that Costco has an exceptional return policy. If you\u2019re not satisfied with a product, they will accept returns (with a full refund!) without any hassle \u2014 and you don\u2019t even need a receipt. That\u2019s right, Costco can often look up purchases using just your membership information.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions to be aware of. Certain electronics like televisions, computers, and cameras have a 90-day return window, while mattresses only have a 30-day return period. Major appliances must be returned within 48 hours of purchase, and items like cigarettes and alcohol have a 14-day return period.\n\nIt Pays To Get Price Adjustments\n\nOur source lets us know that if you purchase an item that goes on sale within 30 days, Costco offers price adjustments. Simply bring your receipt to the membership counter to receive a refund for the price difference.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Need a Membership\n\nNo, really. There are clever ways to get your hands on Costco goods without paying the price.\n\nOne option is to consider a Costco Cash Card. By having a member purchase it for you, this card serves as your golden ticket to enter the store and enjoy a shopping spree without needing your own membership.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlternatively, you can explore the convenience of shopping directly from Costco.com or even utilize popular grocery delivery services like Instacart. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that online purchases might come with a premium price tag and additional delivery fees.\n\nSo, while there are alternatives to accessing Costco\u2019s offerings, it\u2019s wise to weigh the potential costs before making a decision.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I Work at Costco: Here Are 12 Insider Secrets You Should Know",

From seasonal coffee cakes to all-new croissants, they keep the oversized tables in the bakery churning.\n\nBut there are some staples that Costco knows if they ditched, there would be a revolt. One of those is a dessert a fan called \"worth its weight in gold.\" So what cake could be so good it has earned that kind of admiration? The tuxedo cake.\n\nWhat Makes The Tuxedo Cake So Unique\n\nIf you're familiar, the tuxedo cake is a chocolate bar cake that cannot really be described as \"just a chocolate cake.\" It's chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.\n\nMore specifically it's a layer of rich chocolate cake that is topped with additional layers of chocolate mousse, white chocolate and vanilla mousse, then dark chocolate ganache with chocolate curls over a final layer of chocolate cake. Pieces of chocolate cake are also studded in the mousse layers for more great bite and texture.\n\nKimberly Holland/Southern Living\n\nReddit's Rave Reviews\n\nOn Reddit, contributors commented that this cake is one of the few they'd bring to a dinner party if they were going for something store-bought. (The other big favorite? Key lime pie, but it's not available all the time.) One person wrote, \"it\u2019s so good, light and fluffy. Maybe some coffee to go with it and heaven.\"\n\nAnd on a post dedicated just to the tuxedo cake, people had even more praise to offer:\n\n\"I brought it to a function recently. The ladies started by being slightly judgey [sic] that I didn't make a homemade dessert and ended by asking me how much they should get for their next family dinner. I bet that event sold 10 more cakes,\" one person wrote.\n\nAnother added, \"I am an avid baker and 'from scratch' snob and I LOVE this thing. We are a household of two, so I have learned it freezes as well too. Get it!\"\n\nTry It For Yourself\n\nWe tried the tuxedo cake for ourselves, and it's easy to understand why someone called it \"worth every penny.\" Editors were coming back for second slices, which almost never happens when we taste test products.\n\nOur cake, purchased in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, was $17.99, but online prices vary. Still, for a cake that is beautiful and tastes more special than any typical sheet cake, this is a bargain. And if we were you, we wouldn't leave your next trip to Costco without one.",

Due to presumed misuse, that concession has been revoked, at least at some stores. And according to Costco employees, it\u2019s for good reason.\n\n\"The grinders were broken at least once a week,\" Redditor @Storkman1007 commented on the initial post. \"Even with signs to not double grind, people would do it all day long and clog the burrs\u2026 Also we had paint brushes to wipe the grounds and keep the machines clean and people would drop the brushes and grind them into their coffee.

            "content": "Retail is emerging from its inflation slump, and most of the country's large retailers demonstrated important progress last year. Amazon (AMZN -2.51%) and Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%), the two largest U.S. retailers behind first-place Walmart, ended the year with solid growth and healthy stock gains.\n\nLet's see what each of these companies brings to the investing table and which one is the better buy today.\n\nThe case for Amazon: Not just retail\n\nAmazon is the largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S. It has higher sales than Costco, and it's still growing faster. It's also more profitable.\n\nCompany Sales Sales Growth Net Income Amazon $158.9 billion 11% $15.3 billion Costco $61 billion 7.5% $1.8 billion\n\nAmazon accounts for around 40% of all U.S. e-commerce sales, a breathtaking lead that's unchallengeable in the near term. It's taking all kinds of actions to protect its position and become the source of even more of its loyal Prime members' shopping, like a new distribution network to keep products closer to customers and get them out faster. E-commerce remains Amazon's core business, and it's still growing. E-commerce is also increasing as a percentage of retail sales, expected to reach 41% of sales, up from 18% in 2017, according to the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nBut there's something else entirely that makes Amazon stand out right now, and that's generative artificial intelligence (AI). Really, it starts with Amazon Web Services, (AWS), Amazon's cloud computing business. AWS is growing faster than e-commerce, and it's a higher-margin business. In the third quarter, sales increased 19% year over year, accounting for 17% of sales and 62% of operating income.\n\nMany of the most valuable generative AI solutions are available to AWS customers, who can tap into all kinds of data and tools to create or benefit from AI. CEO Andy Jassy keeps saying things like it's a \"once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity\" and that it's already a billion-dollar run rate business.\n\nThere could be many factors to add in Amazon's favor, but another important one is its growing advertising business, or better framed, its constant innovations that lead to new businesses and sales-generating opportunities.\n\nThe case for Costco: Steady and reliable\n\nYou might say Costco is the very opposite of Amazon. As much as Amazon jumps from here to there, catching onto the flavor of the week, Costco is steadfast.\n\nThat's not completely true; every company has to shift to meet changing needs, and Costco's doing a fabulous job at staying the course with what it does best while embracing new opportunities to create more value for shoppers and shareholders. It offers self-checkout counters for quicker shopping, and it's been experimenting with the best way to integrate e-commerce into its platform. For example, it offers store pickup for many items, a service Amazon can't offer. It also allows customers to check store inventory for many products. In the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 24), e-commerce sales increased 13% over last year. Traffic, order value, and conversion rates all increased year over year.\n\nCostco also releases monthly results, and e-commerce picked up even more, 34% year over year. Management says that was due to Thanksgiving-related sales happening a week later than last year, but it was a strong result nontheless.\n\nBut Costco is dependable because it has a reliable membership model that customers love. You might say that Costco's main business isn't selling products but selling memberships. Paid households increased 7.6% year over year to more than 77 million in Q1, and membership fee income increased 7.8% to $1.2 billion. Renewal rates were high, as usual, at 92.8% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide.\n\nCostco also pays a dividend, which has a low yield of 0.48% at the current price. But it also pays an attractive special dividend occasionally that was $15 in 2023.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nNeither of these stocks is cheap, but Costco is more expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55 vs. 47 for Amazon.That makes it harder to call Costco a better value.\n\nFor most investors, Amazon is going to be the better buy. It's growing faster and has more opportunities. However, investors who are looking for a solid, reliable stock and passive income, like a retiree, might choose Costco instead.",

Some opined about its functionality and appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, others suggested Costco should bring \"scan and go\" technology to its shopping experience.\n\nFOX Business reached out to the warehouse retailer for comment.\n\nIn its most recent annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said its concept focuses \"offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories\" that will \"produce high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover.\" It typically offers under 4,000 different products at its warehouses at a given time.\n\nCOSTCO SOLD AN AROUND-THE-WORLD WORLD CRUISE FOR $293K\n\nCostco noted on its website that it has a \"treasure hunt atmosphere\" at its nearly 900 warehouses.\n\n\"One of the most exciting things about shopping in our warehouses is you never know the kind of incredible deals you\u2019ll find from one visit to the next,\" a page on the company\u2019s website said. \"And, because we rotate out and introduce new merchandise all the time, we encourage you to purchase items that interest you sooner rather than later to avoid missing out.\"\n\nWith its layout, Costco is seeking \"economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory,\" according to its most-recent annual report. Its control of entrances and its use of memberships helps keep theft at lower levels than other retailers, according to the company.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % COST COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP. 890.62 -36.46 -3.93%\n\nAsked about \"scan and go\" during Costco\u2019s earnings call last month, CEO Ron Vachris told analysts and investors the company does hear about the technology occasionally.\n\nHe said self-checkout \"has been a great option for our members and we focus on that.\" Costco \"will continue to keep an eye on technology and how we can improve that front-end experience that is the one pinch point,\" according to Vachris.\n\nThe company began rolling out membership card scanners at the front of its U.S. warehouses over the summer last year.\n\nThe scanners \"took a lot of pressure off of the cashiers and moving lines through and saw some nice productivity enhancements when we did that,\" Vachris said last month.\n\nCOSTCO'S \u2018NETFLIX MOMENT\u2019 BIG WIN\n\nDuring the earnings call prior to that, the CEO said they have helped Costco with its ability to \"adjust front-end lines that we need to open and close lines based on fluctuations of business\" and made the checkout process faster by removing the \"friction of membership verification\" at registers, among other benefits.\n\nThe company has been working on both its website and app.\n\nIn September, for instance, Costco executives said the company had improved the \"native search function\" for the U.S. version of its app. More recently, in December, CFO Gary Millership said Costco \"continue[s] to make progress with our technology roadmap and enhancements made to the member experience,\" such as adding the feature to check warehouse inventory through its app.\n\nSome 138.8 million people have Costco membership cards, according to Costco.\n\n\n\n",

I have to eat a lower sodium diet for a recent diagnosis I received so the little bottles are great for a hydration boost that doesn't break my sodium allowance. My Costco recently went through a lull in stock of them and I was told they would be coming back soon. When they did come back they were almost double the sodium for the same amount! And way sweeter which is so gross to me. Why?????????!!!!!!!!\" one unhappy Redditor posted.\n\nLiquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier\u2014BUY\n\nCostco shoppers love the Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier ($29.99 for 30). \"I don't know if it's scientifically proven but it definitely works for me. Compared to other hydration drinks on the market, it really tastes good,\" one person said in the reviews. \"It has a subtle sweetness with a crisp edge to it I can only describe as refreshing and clean as opposed to the syrupy or oily taste of the better known hydration drinks on the market. The individual packets are sized perfect for on the go use. I use liquid IV during my 100 mile bike rides, Ironman races, and other endurance events or whenever it's just extremely hot outside. I can keep drinking it for hours without getting the sensation of \"Gat**ade gut\" that other products have left with me.\"\n\nNinja Thirsti Drink System with 12 Flavoured Water Drops\u2014BUY\n\nThe Ninja Thirsti ($219.99) is a huge hit with Costco shoppers. \"I got this set up tonight and I'm in love! I only stopped by for lettuce LOL,\" one Redditor said. \"I. Am. Obsessed! This is my favorite appliance ever! I used to own a sodastream and it was the hottest of the hot messes ever!

Hydration Booster ($16.99 for 30). \"I am obsessed. Such a great value and has become a part of my routine. I love how there is no artificial colors or dyes and a pretty clean ingredient label. These really help me rehydrate quickly for gym or if I'm hungover.

Want to return the entire cake or box of chocolate chip cookies? No problem \u2014 Costco's outstanding refund policy covers bakery items.\n\nAccording to a conversation between Redditors, Costco does not hesitate to accept any returns from the bakery section or any food products \u2014 even if it has already taken a few bites out of it. While customers shouldn't bring an empty box of muffins expecting all their money back, they can return at least 50% of the bakery or food product, whether it's partially eaten or not. Be mindful of the fact that Costco will not accept any returns on customizable cakes or food trays. If your items meet these qualifications, then you should be in the clear.\n\nThe process is relatively easy to approach \u2014 simply take the unwanted baked goods to a cashier, and after evaluation, they'll typically refund the money with no questions asked. The company has such a lenient return policy because it always wants to ensure customer satisfaction. Costco's commitment to its customers is why people keep renewing memberships yearly and continue to shop at its stores.\n\nThis might be one of the hacks that will change the way you shop at Costco. It comes in handy when you're not too fond of a new dessert you wanted to try, or if you've accidentally purchased an expired item.",

            "content": "Q: Will Costco try again for another building site in South Naples? \u2014 Millie Wilcox, East Naples\n\nA: Costco Wholesale Corp. is moving ahead with plans for a second store in Collier County on the southeast corner of Rattlesnake Hammock Road and Collier Boulevard, immediately north of Physicians Regional Medical Center-Collier Boulevard. Site development plans and renderings were created last fall for a 158,316-square-foot Costco store with a freestanding fueling station that would provide relief for the chain\u2019s busy longtime location on Naples Boulevard in North Naples.\n\nCostco proposes to develop nearly 26 acres on that heavily wooded corner at 8392 Collier Blvd., leaving 4 acres for outparcels fronting Collier Boulevard. The warehouse membership club would include the sale of groceries and merchandise; tire sales and installation areas; walk-in dairy and produce coolers; and a 2,000-square-foot liquor store, according to the warehouse concept plan created in September.\n\nAt a staff meeting last fall at Costco in North Naples, employees were told that the newly proposed Costco is targeted to open in 2026. Its construction is expected to be a fast-track project designed to be quickly built, most likely with tilt walls. Nevertheless, the project still is not a done deal.\n\nIn December, the national retail chain filed paperwork with Growth Management requesting a waiver of Collier County\u2019s Land Development Code requirement that commercial lots with automobile service stations be separated by 500 feet. Costco\u2019s proposed lot with a fueling station is only 132 feet from the new 7-Eleven convenience store with gas pumps on the northeast corner of Rattlesnake Hammock Road and Collier Boulevard. The county notes that the measurement is the shortest distance between the nearest property line points of any two lots occupied by an automobile service station or one for which a building permit has been issued.\n\nThe waiver request would be decided after a public hearing by the Collier County Hearing Examiner, a quasi-judicial officer who reports directly to the Board of County Commissioners. The Hearing Examiner\u2019s Office was established in 2013 to augment the county\u2019s Planning Commission and Board of Zoning Appeals for hearing, evaluating and deciding specific land use and development proposals. The applicant or any county department may appeal the final decision of the Hearing Examiner to the Board of County Commissioners.\n\n\u201cA party to the hearing can appeal to the BCC; all others would have to appeal to the Circuit Court,\u201d said Planning & Zoning Division Director Mike Bosi, who notes that county commissioners otherwise do not need to \u201cbless\u201d the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Hearing Examiner may grant a waiver if the applicant can show that the site proposed for development of a service station is separated from another service station by natural or man-made structures or other features that minimize the necessity for the distance requirement, the county reports. The proposed member-based Costco gas station and the conventional 7-Eleven gas station are separated by the four-lane Rattlesnake Hammock Road, Costco notes in its waiver request.\n\nBoth 7-Eleven and the proposed Costco are part of the Hacienda Lakes mixed-use planned unit development. Collier commissioners approved the commercial development there more than 13 years ago.\n\nHacienda Lakes MPUD was created in October 2011 when more than 2,260 acres of mostly agricultural land was rezoned by a supermajority vote of the county commission. The project was permitted to include 1,760 homes, 327,000 square feet of retail space, 70,000 square feet of professional and medical office space, 135 hotel rooms, 140,000 gross square feet of business park or educational facility, and a school. Hacienda Lakes of Naples conveyed a tract of land to the Collier County Public Schools for a future elementary school.\n\nSpecific businesses or types of businesses have not been proposed yet for the 4 acres of commercial lots planned on the Hacienda Lakes corner between Costco and Collier Boulevard.\n\nThe \u201cTim Aten Knows\u201d weekly column answers local questions from readers.

I only shop for myself and my partner, so Costco sizes don't always make sense for us. But there are still a few items I choose to buy at Costco because of their impressive quality and competitive prices (looking at you, meat counter). When I make my quarterly visits, one budget-friendly ingredient is always on my list: the Kirkland Signature Parmigiano-Reggiano wedge.\n\nAdobe Stock / mandritoiu\n\nI am a cheese lover\u2014it might just be my favorite food. But high-quality cheese comes at a high price point. This 2-pound wedge at Costco is my workaround. Genuine Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano is often over $20 per pound, so $23 for 2 pounds of the real stuff from Costco is a great deal. Since it's a hard cheese, it lasts in the fridge for up to 6 weeks when stored properly (think: airtight plastic or reusable bag). If you are really worried about getting through the larger size wedge, you can freeze it for up to 6 months.\n\nChoosing a large wedge like this keeps me from buying the preshredded or grated stuff. I am definitely not shaming anyone for deciding to buy shredded cheese, but there are a few reasons I avoid it. First, many shredded cheeses are coated with starch or anticaking agents to keep them from sticking together in the container. While these starches and anticaking agents are safe to eat, they can mess with how your cheese melts. I also like to use Parmesan in other shapes than just shredded. I use a veggie peeler to top pasta or risotto with shavings. Slices or broken-off hunks are great for charcuterie boards (or simple snacking). Cubes are perfect for chopped salad or antipasto salad. Drop the rind into soup or while cooking dried beans to impart a nice, umami-rich flavor into the broth (or in recipes like our one-pot lentil & vegetable soup with Parmesan). To be Thrifty, we love finding a use for things that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nNext time you head to Costco, consider adding the Kirkland Signature Parmigiano-Reggiano wedge to your list. It will save you some money while giving a serious flavor boost to your meals. For more, check out my 12 Best Mediterranean Diet Foods on a Budget.",

            "content": "Several of you asked me to write about Costco wine, proving that The Corrupt Wine Writer is not reaching the demographic we desire.\n\nYes, I buy wines at Costco. It\u2019s exciting to see them there, because they are the only non-rotisserie-chicken, normal-sized item in the store. When you put the bottles inside your cart next to the gallon jug of hand soap, you can\u2019t help but ponder where you\u2019ll place them in your dollhouse.\n\nThere are blogs devoted to which wines to buy there, and every newspaper wine columnist and food magazine has ranked Costco\u2019s wines. It\u2019s the liberal media elite\u2019s way of saying, \u201cWe wear Puma low-rise socks just like you do.\u201d The Wall Street Journal runs a Costco wine review column so often that it nearly balances out the fact that they have a section called Mansions.\n\nSome writers go so far as to pair Costco wines with Costco products (one suggested a cabernet sauvignon with Bark Thin \u201csnacking chocolates\u201d). This is cult-like consumerist behavior and is to be avoided as assiduously as thinking of chocolate as a snack.\n\nI pick up some wines at Costco I have weird attachments to, like the $16 Stag\u2019s Leap merlot. I also buy some to go with an upcoming meal, like the $15 Chateau Bouscass\u00e9 Madiran or the $14 Bodega Garzon Tannat Reserva from Uruguay (both are the same grape, tannat, which is, you know, really tannic) for a cassoulet.\n\nThe first thing to know about Costco wine shopping is that not all of the wines are bargains. I can sometimes find them for the same price or cheaper at my local store, K&L. And yes, I stand there with my phone checking, pretending to be texting my wife about whether we need paper goods. (Which I know we do.)\n\nI used to be attracted to the wines on sale and the bins that are emptied except for two bottles. Then I realized they restock the bins throughout the day and that you shouldn\u2019t buy mediocre wine because it\u2019s $3 cheaper than at other stores.\n\nThe second thing I look for is giant bottles. I\u2019m the jerk who shows up at a big dinner party holding a 3L or even a 6L above my head, as desperate to be liked as John Cusack in Say Anything.\n\nNormally, you pay a premium for larger formats because it\u2019s expensive for the wineries to buy the giant bottles, reset the machines to fill the giant bottles and then label the giant bottles. But some of the big bottles at Costco are cheaper, per liter, than you can get in stores for normal 750ml bottles.\n\nAround Christmas, Costco stocks up on these. I just bought a 3L of 2020 Tenuta di Nozzole Chianti Classico Riserva for $60. (Usually $20 a bottle, and I got four bottles worth). I once scored a magnum of Segura Viudas, the greatest cava in the world due to its metal ringed bottle that is so ridiculous that my wife and I simply call it Pimp Cava. Plus, it\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s good enough, and, most importantly, it comes in a bottle that Snoop would make a bong out of.\n\nThe real value at Costco lies in its Kirkland brand wines. There\u2019s a glut of wine on the worldwide market because young people aren\u2019t drinking it, preferring tequila, whiskey, and the drunken daze of their phones. Countries are paying farmers to tear out vineyards. Wineries don\u2019t want to cut their prices, because that makes their wines look bad. So instead, some wineries sell their stuff to other people to put their own labels on it. If you look at the back label of some Kirkland bottles, you can even see where they\u2019re buying the wine from.\n\nYou need more wine expert balls than I have to bring Kirkland brand wines to a dinner party. But I do drink them at home. I would pour them in a decanter for guests and toss the bottle, though that would ruin my ability to bore them with my wine knowledge.\n\nMost reviewers get excited about the $20 Kirkland Champagne, but I think that\u2019s just because it\u2019s a $20 Champagne. I\u2019m no Champagne expert, but I\u2019ve had a bunch of $30 Champagnes that I liked at least 50% better than the Kirkland one.\n\nI like the Kirkland $7 Bordeaux Superieur. (Yes, Costco is the biggest seller of Bordeaux in the U.S.) The $8 Prosecco is good enough for an Aperol spritz. The $14 Gigondas is a deal. Their $20 Barolo is so much cheaper than any other Barolo that you should buy it just to know what wine from Barolo tastes like. This is also true for the $17 10-year tawny port.\n\nSome of my other favorite Kirkland wines are the $18, big-ass, super-American Suscol Vineyard Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, and the just slightly less big-ass $20 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon. The $20 Chateauneuf-du-Pape is decent, maybe a little too fruit-forward sweet, and not as good as that $14 bottle from neighboring Gigondas; plus, you can\u2019t exploit the brand-name \u201cChateauneuf-du-Pape\u201d by bringing it to a party because \u201cKirkland\u201d is on the label.\n\nFinally, your Costco has a wine buyer. They\u2019re often milling around the section. And like all wine buyers, they love to talk. Not necessary with you, but at you. They\u2019ll tell you what they\u2019re proud of getting and what they\u2019re putting in their cellars. It\u2019s a great way to add 30 minutes to your four-hour Costco trip.\n\nAll that said, I buy less than 5 percent of my wines at Costco. That\u2019s because most of the wines at Costco are over-marketed bottles from big producers (The Prisoner, Josh, Kim Crawford, Veuve Clicquot). I prefer getting recommendations from the people at my local store. Even for big parties, I can find less obvious wines there for near Costco-level prices.\n\nBut reason not the need when at Costco. It\u2019s a celebration of American consumerism. Get the giant bottles.\n\nFor the comment section: What are your favorite Costco wines? And have you brought Kirkland wines to a party? If so, are you very rich and were doing that Common People thing?",

Here's why you should, too.\n\nCostco Is Now Selling La Vie Gourmand Portuguese Custard Tarts\n\nCostco recently started selling La Vie Gourmand Portuguese Custard Tarts, famously delicious Portuguese delights known as pasteis de nata. A recent Reddit thread grabbed our attention when the original poster stated, \"Would you believe me if I said I fell to the cold, concrete Costco floor when I saw these last week?\" They go on to describe how they had the original pastry while visiting Lisbon, and while \u201cnothing can substitute for the real thing,\" these \u201cmini cups of heaven [are] so damn close.\u201d\n\nEach box, featuring a \"Made in Portugal\" stamp, contains 18 \"delicately flakey [pastries], filled with silky rich vanilla custard\" for around $13. The OP even notes that pasteis de nata was named one of the 50 best things to eat in the world (turns out, it's true). Now we can all have a taste, thanks to Costco.\n\nAnother fan was \u201cshocked\" the first time they were spotted at an Ohio warehouse\u2014and was pleasantly surprised by how good they were: \u201cMy family [is] Portuguese, and everyone I've served these to has given them the seal of approval.\u201d\n\nWhile we\u2019re all about making these tarts from scratch, we can\u2019t argue that having some on hand in the freezer\u2014without all the work\u2014is pretty nice. Since they are frozen, you\u2019ll need to warm the pastries before enjoying them. One Reddit user said 9 minutes in an air fryer at 375 degrees F worked well, but popping them in the oven for a few minutes will also do.\n\nSo far, the tarts have been spotted nationwide at local Costco stores from New York to Ohio to California.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get your hands on these sweet, custardy bites, you better make a shopping trip to Costco pretty quickly. They're being dubbed \u201cthe best frozen dessert\u201d the store has ever carried by one customer. A Costco shopper noticed someone in the store with \u201ca literal half cart\u201d worth of the tarts, and another is \"definitely returning...once this box is empty.\u201c\n\n\n\nSounds like this new frozen treat is worth its own trip\u2014especially now when boxes are on sale for $3.50 off through Jan. 20.\n\n",

Nationwide, more than 18,000 Teamsters at Costco are demanding an historic, industry-leading contract and are prepared to strike if Costco fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cCostco has just 15 days to present our members with the contract they deserve, or they\u2019ll face the full power of this union,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien. \u201cWe will secure the strongest contract in Costco\u2019s history. Our members are organized, mobilized, and ready to do whatever it takes to win an agreement that reflects the record-breaking profits they generate for this company.\u201d\n\nThis week, Costco Teamsters nationwide ramped up their mobilization efforts with practice pickets to prepare for a potential labor dispute. On Tuesday, Teamsters locals in Hayward, Calif., and Sumner, Wash., held practice picket actions. Yesterday, East Coast Costco Teamsters staged a practice picket and rally on Long Island.\n\n\u201cThis company\u2019s massive profits are a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our members,\u201d said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. \u201cWe are committed to securing a fair deal, but if Costco refuses to meet our members\u2019 demands, they\u2019ll learn just how essential these workers are to their bottom line. Without a contract by January 31, we will take action.\u201d\n\nCostco recently reported $254 billion in annual revenue and $7.4 billion in net profits \u2014 a 135 percent increase since 2018. Despite these record gains, the company has yet to meet the Teamsters\u2019 demands for fair wages and benefits.\n\n\u201cMany of us have given decades of our lives to this company, and all we are asking for is a fair share of its massive success,\u201d said John Robledo, a Costco worker in Carson, Calif., and a member of Local 572. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this company grow into what it is today, but it\u2019s no longer the same place I started working at over 30 years ago. We don\u2019t want to strike, but we will if Costco continues to ignore us.\u201d\n\nThe final round of negotiations is set to begin on January 20 near Costco\u2019s corporate headquarters in Issaquah, Wash. Costco Teamsters have made it clear: they will not work a day past the expiration of the current contract on January 31.\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

            "content": "The board of Apple has joined Costco\u2019s board in recommending that investors reject shareholder proposals from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that ask the companies to publish a report on the risk of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs or eliminate them completely. Corporate board members at other companies that want to remain committed to their DEI programs may want to examine how these two companies are dealing with these anti-DEI shareholder proposals and adapt some of their methods.\n\nAlthough the shareholder votes on these proposals have not yet been completed, any board of a company that might be targeted by NCPPR might want to begin discussing and planning how they might react to anti-DEI shareholder proposals. Of course, as several other companies determined last year, ending such programs is also an option that boards can choose.\n\nIn Apple\u2019s case, the NCPPR shareholder proposal is asking the company to cease all DEI efforts. The conservative group argues that last year\u2019s US Supreme Court ruling that discrimination on the basis of race in college admissions violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment may also apply to corporate DEI programs, potentially equating them with illegal discrimination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\u201d NCPPR wrote in its supporting statement to its shareholder proposal against Apple. \u201cShareholders request that the Company consider abolishing its Inclusion & Diversity program, policies, department and goals.\u201d\n\nIn its shareholder proposal against Costco, NCPPR is asking that \u201cthe Board conduct an evaluation and publish a report, omitting proprietary and privileged information, on the risks of the Company maintaining its current DEI (including \u201cPeople & Communities\u201d) roles, policies and goals.\u201d\n\nIn its supporting statement to its shareholder proposal against Costco, NCPPR wrote, \u201cWith 310,000 employees, Costco likely has at least 200,000 employees who are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight. Accordingly, even if only a fraction of those employees were to file suit, and only some of those prove successful, the cost to Costco could be tens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn both cases, NCPPR has labeled DEI as \u201cillegal discrimination\u201d even though no court has made that determination, and the conservative group cites the threat of lawsuits as the primary risk and reason for getting rid of DEI programs.\n\nHere is how the Apple and Costco boards are dealing with these challenging shareholder proposals:\n\nIn its proxy statement, Apple has responded to the shareholder proposal asking it to cease all DEI programs by asserting that:\n\n1. The proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program and the proposal inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies. The proposal inappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company\u2019s programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance.\n\n2. Apple\u2019s Board and management team maintain active oversight of legal and regulatory risks and compliance for its global business. Apple\u2019s determination of the appropriate means by which to comply with applicable law, including any associated changes to our programs, policies, departments, or goals, is a fundamental aspect of Apple\u2019s business operations.\n\n3. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business. And we strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\n\nIn its proxy statement, Costco has responded to the shareholder proposal asking for a report on the risks associated with its DEI programs by asserting that:\n\n1. Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members, and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics: For our employees, these efforts are built around inclusion \u2013 having all of our employees feel valued and respected. Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all.\n\n2. We believe (and member feedback shows) that many of our members like to see themselves reflected in the people in our warehouses with whom they interact.Having diversity in our supplier base, including appropriate attention to small businesses, is beneficial for many of the same reasons diversity benefits our Company. We believe that it fosters creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer our members.\n\n3. As part of our obeying the law, all decisions regarding recruiting, hiring, promotion, assignment, training, termination, and other terms and conditions of employment will be made without unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, work-related injury, covered military or veteran status, political ideology or expression, genetic information, marital status, or other protected status.\n\n4. Our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is not, however, only for the sake of improved financial performance but to enhance our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence. The proponent professes concern about legal and financial risks to the Company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives. The supporting statement demonstrates that it is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs. The proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the Company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\n\nThe key takeaways from the Apple and Costco boards\u2019 responses are:\n\n\u2022 Respond quickly and directly to shareholders, explaining why the company engages in DEI programs. Apple states that the company strives to \u201ccreate a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d Costco states that \u201cOur efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics.\u201d These statements and more are in the company proxy statements for all investors to see so they can draw their own conclusions.\n\n\u2022 Emphasize that your company follows the law and is aware of what it needs to do to operate the DEI programs legally and in compliance with current regulations. Make sure to point out that your company does not discriminate against anyone.\n\n\u2022 If possible, declare and substantiate any benefits (financial performance, recruitment, enhanced corporate culture or otherwise) that DEI has contributed to the company.\n\nLastly, Costco sought to demonstrate that the NCPPR has an anti-DEI agenda that actually is contributing to the legal risks that it claims to want to eliminate for the company (noting that it has threatened filing lawsuits against others.) That approach might hold more risk than some boards would like to take.\n\nPrint Article",

            "content": "St. George \u2022 A second Costco slated for construction in St. George will be bigger than the first and could debut in early 2026.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s St. George Planning Commission meeting, commissioners voted 6-0 to recommend approval of the Costco planned for nearly 18 acres at 4700 S. Desert Color Parkway, just north of Southern Parkway and near Interstate 15.\n\n\u201cI think Costco will be great there,\u201d said Planning Commissioner Austin Anderson, echoing the sentiment of his commission colleagues.\n\nAs currently outlined, Costco officials told planning commissioners, the new building will consist of at least 160,000 square feet and possibly even more. That\u2019s 12,000 square feet more than the first Costco, which opened on the other side of town at 835 N. 3050 East nearly a quarter-century ago.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to work on the master plan, the building [could] get a little bit bigger as we add more features inside \u2026 and then move the mechanical equipment around,\u201d said Costco Real Estate Director Stephen Cross, adding the size of the store could increase another 1,000 to 4,000 square feet.\n\nAs for when the second store \u2013 billed as Costco South St. George \u2013 might open, Cross told planning commissioners that the construction drawings are already underway and the new Costco could happen as early as February or March in 2026.\n\nBidding for the win\n\nSt. George landed the new Costco after emerging as the winner in a competitive bid process that involved other Washington County cities. As part of its winning bid, St. George offered an incentive package that defers up to $3.18 million in building permit and impact fees and public infrastructure and related costs for 10 years.\n\nThat amount is forgiven at the end of that period provided Costco meets performance-based standards, which include the multibillion-dollar retailer operating the two stores within city boundaries. Without the incentives, city officials attest, the store could well have landed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt was a competitive process,\u201d said St. George Economic Development Director Chad Thomas. [Costco] \u201cwas looking at a few sites in Washington County, and the incentive agreement provides an opportunity to bring that second Costco \u2026 to St. George.\u201d\n\nFor his part, St. George Council member Jimmie Hughes calls the deal a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cFrom an economic standpoint,\u201d he said, \u201chaving another Costco will boost the amount of sales tax the city collects and is one of the ways we can keep our property taxes low. The nice thing about sales taxes is they also get paid by visitors, second homeowners in St. George and residents who live in neighboring cities. So that\u2019s a great return on our investment in Costco.\u201d\n\nTicking the boxes\n\nAside from the incentive package it is offering, according to city officials, St. George ticks a lot of boxes that make it an ideal location for a second Costco. For starters, its location adjacent Interstate 15 and near other major highways and traffic arteries is a plus. So is the St. George metropolitan area\u2019s rapid growth. Washington County\u2019s population is projected to more than double to about 465,000 by 2060.\n\nIn addition to the main building, the new Costco will include 797 parking stalls and a five-lane fueling station that will have 15 pumps that provide 30 fueling positions.\n\nCostco proposes illuminating the property with 30-foot-tall street lamps, which some planning commissioners said they would like lowered to lessen the light pollution in the area. But Cross countered that taller lights provide more uniform lighting.\n\nNow the Planning Commission has signed off on the design and site plan for the store, the matter will soon go before the City Council, which is expected to follow the Planning Commission\u2019s lead.\n\nSaid Hughes: \u201cI\u2019m excited to see another Costco, and I think residents living in Sun River and other areas near where it will be built are looking forward to it as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

If the proposal passes, Costco will be required to reassess its DEI programs.

Furthermore, it says diversity helps attract suppliers, particularly small businesses, reinforcing Costco\u2019s status as one of the top retailers in the U.S. \u2013 an advantage that\u2019s crucial as its e-commerce growth lags behind rivals like Walmart and Target.",

O\u2019Brien, Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman, Teamsters Warehouse Division Director Tom Erickson and members of Teamsters Locals 210, 570, and 822 will \u201cpractice picket\u201d at 11 a.m. at the Costco store at 1250 Old Country Road in Westbury and hold an afternoon rally at Local 282 headquarters at 2500 Marcus Ave. in New Hyde Park, according to a Teamsters advisory.\n\nThe Costco Teamsters National Master Agreement, which expires on Jan. 31, covers more than 18,000 workers nationwide. The union says it has submitted what it calls a \u201ccomprehensive economic proposal\u201d reflecting the retail giant\u2019s 135% increase in profits, but the Teamsters contend that Costco\u2019s proposed deal doesn\u2019t include a fair wage increase or improvements to retirement benefits, according to published reports.\n\nThe union says Costco \u201cabruptly ended\u201d collective bargaining negotiations last week, though talks are scheduled to resume Thursday.\n\n\u201cOur national negotiating committee is fully committed to securing an agreement with Costco, but the company has shown little interest in working constructively to reach a fair deal,\u201d O\u2019Brien said in a written statement. \u201cIn the middle of a workday, Costco walked away from the bargaining table. With less than a month until the contract expires, the company should be working overtime to reach a fair agreement \u2014 not walking away from negotiations.\u201d\n\nCostco has yet to be reached for comment.\n\nLast year, Costco recorded $254 billion in revenue and over $7.4 billion in net profit, a $6.3 billion year-over-year increase and a 135% increase from $3.1 billion in 2018, according to the union.

A lot of home mixologists, however, flock to the popular warehouse retailer for its selection of booze. Not only is Costco's alcohol reasonably priced (and, in some states, you can buy it without a membership!), but, from time to time, a careful scan of the shelves yields some rare and interesting finds. Who can forget the time period where you could buy a whole barrel of Jack Daniel's at Costco, for instance?\n\nA lucky roll of the Costco dice recently took place for one Reddit bourbon lover, who posted a picture of a bottle of exclusive 2024 King of Kentucky just perched on the shelf like it was no big deal. Commenters went crazy. Not only is King of Kentucky hard to find in the wild, owing to limited production runs and distribution, but it is very expensive. The Costco price tag of $259.99 spotted by the Redditor was a significant deal compared to the standard $350 MSRP for a 750mL bottle. Basically, this was the whiskey-related equivalent of finding an original Renaissance D\u00fcrer drawing in a garage sale picture frame (yes, that really happened).\n\nDon't go running out the door to your local Costco, just yet, however. Other commenters on the Reddit thread agreed that this was a singular find. Their own searches did not turn up similar bounties, though who knows what may pop up at your local Costco?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: 12 Costco Grocery Products To Buy And 7 To Avoid\n\nA Bottle Of King Of Kentucky Is A Find Indeed\n\nA bottle of King of Kentucky bourbon on a bar - The Barrel Room at Golden Ox/Facebook\n\nBourbon doesn't necessarily need to originate in Kentucky, but it's widely agreed that the best stuff is distilled in the Bluegrass State. Of Kentucky bourbons, King of Kentucky certainly ranks in the upper echelon. It's an old name in the industry that was resurrected in the last 10 years by the Brown-Forman company. Tasting it yields notes of \"dark chocolate, old oak, sweet coconut, malt and rich vanilla over wood spice,\" according to Brown-Forman master distiller Chris Morris (via the Lexington Herald-Leader). Not only is the bourbon ultra-premium, but its quantities are seriously limited. In 2024, only 5,100 bottles of the bourbon were made available in a handful of U.S. states. Back in 2007, Morris hand-selected the lots of barrels that would age into that 2024 bourbon. Each bottle has a wax seal and an individually-numbered label imprinted with a serial number and lot number.\n\nSo, it's understandable that the bourbon denizens at Reddit freaked out when they saw the photo of King of Kentucky sitting on the Costco shelf. \"You better have bought it,\" swore one commenter. \"I think my brain paused for 3 seconds,\" another gasped. A peek at the OP's posting history solved the mystery: they did buy it. They even hooked up a coworker with the same deal. Perhaps the only thing better than a once-in-a-lifetime Costco find is a happy ending just like that one.\n\nRead the original article on Foodie.",

Bourbon drinkers will be excited to know that select warehouses are stocking a 750 milliliter bottle of King of Kentucky Single Barrel Bourbon for only $260 (limit one). While this seems like a high price for a fifth of whiskey, it's actually quite the bargain considering this collectible bottle of bourbon is currently listed for a whopping $2,000 at most other stores where it's available. The amazing markdown is even better than a different rare $150 bourbon Costco shoppers can buy for $60.\n\nThere's probably no better place to find insider tips for rare Costco liquor finds than the Costco alcohol subreddit. One Redditor posted a picture of a bottle of King of Kentucky on one of the store's shelves, listing California as the location of the find. It's hard to say how many Costco warehouses actually carry it, but the Golden State seems to be the place to snag this top shelf bourbon. Unfortunately, the clues to which Costco locations in California carry the premium bourbon are scarce (presumably because once the word gets out, the bottles disappear quickly).

Teamsters are demanding a contract that reflects the company's record-breaking profits and are ready to strike if Costco fails to deliver a fair agreement.\n\n\"We're out here today to send a clear message to Costco that we are ready to do whatever it takes to secure the contract we deserve,\" said Jesse Sexton, a Local 150 member and Costco worker in Sacramento. \"None of us wants to strike, but the company is making enormous profits, and all we're asking for is our fair share. If Costco refuses to present us with an acceptable offer, they'll be striking themselves.\"\n\nThe Costco Teamsters National Negotiating Committee recently concluded its third week of bargaining with the company. While some progress was made on seniority rights and the role of shop stewards, Costco has yet to present an economic package that reflects its soaring profits or includes increases to retirement benefits.\n\n\"I've been a Costco driver for 12 years, and watched this company grow into one of the largest retailers in the world,\" said Robert Campus, a Local 174 member and fleet driver in Sumner, Wash. \"It's time for Costco to stop prioritizing Wall Street and corporate executives over the workers who built this company. We're fully prepared to strike if offered anything less than an industry-leading, record-breaking contract.\"\n\nThe Teamsters represent over 18,000 Costco workers nationwide. Recently, the company reported annual revenue of $254 billion and net profits of $7.4 billion \u2014 a 135 percent increase from $3.1 billion in 2018. Despite these record profits, Costco has yet to honor its workers' demands for fair wages and benefits.\n\nThe final round of negotiations is scheduled to begin January 20 near Costco's corporate headquarters in Issaquah, Wash.\n\n\"Costco has two weeks to bring forward a fair collective bargaining agreement, or our members will take to the streets,\" said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. \"Costco is the third-largest retailer on the planet. They can more than afford to provide the wages and benefits our members are asking for, and the Teamsters are ready to hold them accountable if they fail to do so.\"\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

            "content": "At a time when many businesses are abandoning their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, Apple and Costco are standing behind theirs.\n\nBoth are encouraging shareholders to vote against resolutions asking them to reevaluate their commitment to DEI. A shareholder resolution is a means by which those who hold stock in a company can seek to influence the company\u2019s policies. Most are nonbinding and most do not receive a majority vote, as the bulk of shareholders usually vote among company lines. But if a resolution receives even 10 percent support, it\u2019s hard for the company to ignore.\n\nThe Apple and Costco resolutions were both submitted by National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank. Both cite the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, holding that race-based affirmative action in college admissions is unconstitutional. The Apple resolution also cites the high court\u2019s 2024 ruling in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, which found that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating in transfer decisions even if the transfer didn\u2019t cause great disadvantage.\n\nThe resolutions say that DEI programs pose financial and reputational risks to companies, noting that a white employee sued Starbucks for racial discrimination and won $25 million. DEI programs vary from company to company, but their generally promote inclusive practices for groups that have historically suffered discrimination, including people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and women.\n\n\u201cWith 310,000 employees, Costco likely has at least 200,000 employees who are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight,\u201d the resolution to the retailing giant states. \u201cAccordingly, even if only a fraction of those employees were to file suit, and only some of those prove successful, the cost to Costco could be tens of billions of dollars.\u201d The Apple resolution doesn\u2019t mention those groups, but it does go into the potential cost of lawsuits.\n\nApple, in its proxy statement (a document sent to shareholders ahead of the annual meeting), recommends a vote against the resolution because \u201cthe proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program and the proposal inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies; and our Board and management maintain active oversight of legal and regulatory risks and compliance for our global business.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cApple seeks to operate in compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws, both in the United States and in the many other jurisdictions in which we operate, and in that regard monitors and evolves its practices, policies, and goals as appropriate to address compliance risks. The proposal inappropriately seeks to micromanage the Company\u2019s programs and policies by suggesting a specific means of legal compliance.\u201d\n\nApple has a supplier diversity program, set up in 1993, which works with groups such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council and National Veterans Business Development Council, CNN reports. It also has a vice president of inclusion and diversity, a position established in 2017, and 67 employee groups called diversity network associations. The first of these dates from 1986. Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, is gay (although he did donate personal funds, not company ones, to anti-LGBTQ+ President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration).\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking for a consideration,\u201d Stefan Padfield, executive director of the NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, told CNN. \u201cThe proposal, if approved, would not automatically result in the abolishment of DEI.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s directors, however, say this is the ultimate goal of such resolutions. \u201cThe proponent professes concern about legal and financial risks to the Company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives,\u201d the proxy statement reads. \u201cThe supporting statement demonstrates that it is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs. The proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the Company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe NCPPR published a document called \u201cBalancing the Boardroom\u201d in 2022, Costco notes. It said CEOs and other corporate executives who are \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201chard-left\u201d are \u201cinimical to the Republic and its blessings of liberty\u201d and \u201ccommitted to critical race theory and the socialist foundations of woke\u201d or \u201cshameless monsters who are willing to sacrifice our future for their comforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all,\u201d Costco\u2019s statement says. \u201cWe believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed. This capacity is critical because we owe our success to our now over 300,000 employees around the globe. \u2026 We believe that our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are legally appropriate, and nothing in the proposal demonstrates otherwise.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s annual shareholder meeting will be held January 23. Apple\u2019s will be held February 25.",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered if a Costco membership is worth it, an argument can be made that it pays for itself in the bakery section alone. The budget-friendly Costco cakes are ready to feed a crowd and can even be customized and decorated for parties. There are jumbo-sized muffins, bagels and baguettes galore. And their gargantuan butter croissants are nothing short of legendary.\n\nAnd as much as we love their current offerings, Costco\u2019s new flaky, buttery pastry knocks everything else out of the water. It\u2019s time to talk about the brand-new almond croissant pastry at Costco.\n\nWhat is the Costco almond croissant pastry?\n\nKristina V\u00e4nni for Taste of Home\n\nThe latest addition to the Costco bakery section is a twist on the classic French delicacy. This treat takes everything you love about a buttery croissant and kicks it up a notch with the addition of an almond filling, sliced almonds on top, and a dusting of powdered sugar.\n\nAvailable right now, these almond croissants are certainly sweeter than their original croissant counterparts. Also, they aren\u2019t in the traditional crescent moon shape. Instead, the dough is folded over a decadent marzipan-flavored center and baked in a muffin tin. The folded shape and sweet taste almost reminded me of a large kouign-amann at first glance.\n\nWith this pastry, every bite is more interesting than the last. The pleasant crunch from the almond topping is a delightful contrast to the tender, sweet almond center. Even though something like this could easily become dense, the light, flaky layers of the pastry keep it from being overwhelming. These pastries taste great right out of the box, or they can be warmed up for a few minutes in the oven for that fresh-from-the-bakery experience.\n\nHow long will it be in stores?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if a product spotted in Costco is a limited-time only deal. The retailer frequently rotates inventory to keep every visit new and exciting. This is especially true in the bakery, where seasonal treats rotate in and out. Since we won\u2019t know for sure how long these almond croissant pastries will stick around, it is definitely worth it to run over there and stock up.\n\nAt a time when grocery store prices seem to be going up and up, Costco has dropped the price of its Kirkland products. These pastries come in a package of six for $11.99, making each one about $2.00. I think that\u2019s a steal since these huge treats are a better deal than you\u2019d find in a coffee shop or bakery.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get through the whole package of six right away, they can certainly be individually wrapped and frozen to enjoy later.",

            "content": "Historical analysis consistently shows that dividend stocks tend to outperform other asset classes across various market cycles. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market. The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience.\n\nNo matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare.\n\nThe year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market\u2019s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Safe Dividend Stocks for 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best safe dividend stocks for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRegarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company\u2019s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio.\n\nCompanies with a history of consistently raising their dividends have typically outperformed those that don\u2019t pay dividends, all while experiencing less volatility. While dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, especially in the current environment, they have played a substantial role in enhancing overall equity returns over the years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 60%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA customer in a warehouse aisles, browsing the wide range of branded and private-label products.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 27.3%\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American retail company that offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. The company\u2019s retail approach secures a strong and self-reinforcing competitive edge. By offering membership-based pricing and discounts on bulk items, the company is attracting a growing number of loyal shoppers worldwide. This could be seen from its latest quarterly earnings. Moreover, the stock has surged by nearly 36% in the past 12 months.\n\nIn fiscal Q1 2025, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $62 billion, which saw a 7.5% growth from the same period last year. The company\u2019s net income for the quarter also jumped to $1.8 billion, from $1.6 billion in the prior-year period. Its cash position was also stable as it ended the quarter with nearly $11 billion available in cash and cash equivalents, up from $9.9 billion in the previous quarter. The company also generated $3.3 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nMadison Investments made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) continues to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability by lowering its emissions. For example, it has converted its Kirkland Signature laundry packs from plastic tubs to a pouch. This has reduced plastic packaging by 80%. It has also moved to localize production of bulky items such as water, paper, and laundry detergents. Manufacturing these goods closer to the countries in which they are sold reduces emissions associated with shipping.\u201d\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.16 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.50%, as of January 13. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 20 consecutive years.\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning investments in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) grew to 75 in Q3 2024, from 71 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $5.4 billion.\n\nOverall, COST ranks 8th on our list of best safe dividend stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for COST to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 69% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Costco Wholesale.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Costco Wholesale\n\nNasdaqGS:COST Ownership Breakdown January 13th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Costco Wholesale?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Costco Wholesale. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Costco Wholesale's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNasdaqGS:COST Earnings and Revenue Growth January 13th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Costco Wholesale. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",

My well-placed source said 'early 2025'.\" Costco members seem thrilled at the news, with one saying, \"Don't toy with my emotions like this\u2026\".

Even people who no longer drink soda are excited for their fellow Coca-Cola aficionados. \"I got SO EXCITED about this news\u2026 then I remembered I haven't had a Diet Coke in the last ten years. (I had to give up soda for health reasons.) I used to love Coke products so much! I drank Diet Coke from morning to night. So I'll rejoice for everyone else!\"\n\nInfluencer Ryan Quinlan (@butthatsmyopinion) announced the news via a December Instagram post, and followers were very excited at the news. \"They're bringing Coca-Cola products back to the Costco food court. That means instead of having Pepsi, Mountain Dew, or Starry, you'll have sodas like Coke, Sprite, Fanta, and root beer,\" he said. \"Coke rules. Pepsi drools,\" one person commented. \"Haven't bought a drink from Costco since they went to Pepsi. I stop at McDonald's on the way there and take me Coke in with me. Saves me an extra stop,\" another user said.\n\nFor those who prefer Pepsi over Coke\u2014enjoy the option while you can, because it might soon be gone forever (or at least for a long while).

They were feeling increasingly militant about their food spending.\n\n\u201cSaving customers money,\u201d including through price, promotions, and rewards, is the most important predictor for retailer success. While that has been increasingly true over the last eight years -- including the most recent period of rapid inflation -- the \u201csavings\u201d pillar now accounts for 38% of a retailer\u2019s long-term success, according to the study.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nWinCo Foods jumped 10 spots this year into fourth place, while Aldi rose two spots to No. 5.\n\nOther big gainers include Trader Joe\u2019s, moving into the seventh spot, an 8-place gain, and Lidl, which ranked 16th, a gain of 14 places.\n\nAmazon, Sam\u2019s Club, Walmart, Publix and Wegman\u2019s all lost ground.\n\nWhile Amazon has been beloved by shoppers in the past, even ranking as the top retailer in 2021 and 2022, it fell out of the top three for the first time in the study\u2019s eight-year history. It places sixth in this year's survey.\n\nThe Cincinnati-based market research company says that between COVID, supply chain upsets and a prolonged period of food inflation, American shoppers have a changed perception of the grocery environment. \u201cClients across the grocery retail sector understand that market success is dependent upon saving shoppers money and implementing innovative pricing technologies to maintain their customer base,\u201d said Matt O\u2019Grady, Dunnhumby's president of the Americas, in the release.\n\nDunnhumby reports that retailers with stronger customer value propositions, as demonstrated by higher scores in the index, grew up to 2.5 times faster over five years compared to those with lower rankings on price.\n\nH-E-B distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack through better savings, quality, shopping experience and assortment.\n\nKroger and Albertson\u2019s suffered ranking declines, with Dunnhumby noting steep declines in states \u201cwhere there were ongoing, high-profile court cases regarding their proposed merger.\u201d\n\nDunnhumby attributes that to consumers expressing less interest in digital offers and more in savings. The impact of digital, Dunnhumby\u2019s third most important pillar, fell from 18.5% to 16% in 2024.",

As the food prices continue to climb, reports show that food inflation is affecting the health of older adults; so many are wondering whether Costco has any discounts in place that specifically cater to senior citizens. The short answer is no \u2014 it does not. That said, seniors could still save money with a Costco membership.\n\nIt's common practice for stores to offer exclusive discounts to vulnerable populations. In fact, so does Costco. The wholesaler's annual membership that allows you to shop in its warehouses costs $65, but certain groups of people can receive $20 to $40 on the Costco Shop Card when they sign up, instantly getting some of the money back. These groups are college students, teachers, medical workers, first responders, government employees, and people in the military. Senior citizens, however, are currently not on the list.\n\nTo be fair to Costco, the annual memberships are the store's main driver of profit and the reason why it's able to keep inventory prices so low. Membership discounts ultimately cut into the profit, which could be the reason why the list of people entitled to a discount is limited.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: 13 Ways To Help Save Money At The Grocery Store\n\nSeniors Can Still Save Money At Costco \u2014 Here's How\n\nSenior man holding a grocery basket - Tom Werner/Getty Images\n\nThe lack of senior-specific discounts is not ideal, but it doesn't mean seniors can't benefit from investing in a Costco membership. The most obvious perks are the wholesale grocery prices, which are lower than at most other retailers. Shopping can admittedly be a difficult experience for some seniors, but Costco actually offers grocery delivery to its members \u2014 including same-day delivery. It can be a great option for anyone who can't physically visit the warehouse.\n\nAnother issue that many retired citizens face is the cost of medication. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed that about 20% of seniors attempted to cope with medication costs by skipping or self-lowering doses, not filling or delaying prescriptions, or using someone else's medication. Costco offers its members significant discounts on prescription drugs, ranging from 2% to 40%, as well as possible deals on certain types of insurance. Another health perk for seniors holding the Costco membership could be the store's partnership with Sesame Care, an online platform that connects patients and providers, offering several exclusive discounts to Costco customers.\n\nRetirement is not all health and grocery bills, though. It's also newfound freedom and spare time. A lot of seniors spend their retirement traveling. Costco offers special travel deals to its members through Costco Travel, so seniors can still save money while booking their fun trips.\n\nRead the original article on Tasting Table.",

Right now, the bakery appears to be rolling out two new croissant pastries: almond croissants we reported on earlier and an all-new savory option they're calling onion cheese pinwheels.\n\nYou'll need to have your toothbrush and toothpaste ready because this is one potent pastry, but it very well could be a new favorite grab-and-go breakfast. These croissant pinwheels are oversized, larger than my hand certainly. Each tender pastry wraps up loads of caramelized onions and cheese, and it's all topped with a sprinkle of umami-rich everything seasoning.\n\nKimberly Holland/Southern Living\n\nYou'll find these pinwheels in a refrigerated compartment of the bakery, and you should keep them refrigerated, despite their already being baked. That's why you'll also want to plan to warm them slightly before enjoying the pastries. Heating makes the croissant tender again, bringing back the buttery flavor and texture, and warms up the onion filling so it's richer.\n\nIf you typically eschew the pancakes and waffles on a breakfast buffet for a lox bagel or breakfast casserole, this could be your new favorite bakery introduction. Because while they're known and appreciated for all their sweet innovations, from pies to coffee cakes, savory ones are certainly fewer and further between.\n\nA box of six pinwheels is just $11.99, bringing each one in at less than $2. You cannot buy any bite-sized breakfast at a coffee shop for that price. Consider that a money saver\u2014and use some of that extra change to buy gum or mints. No one will be eager to pucker up for a smooch after one bite of these pinwheels.\n\nBased on social media posts, these are only just beginning to roll out to warehouse clubs, so your store may not have them quite yet.

            "content": "Costco sales were up 7.5% to $60.99 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and the company plans on opening at least 29 more locations this year\u2014proof people can't get enough of the giant warehouse chain. The membership-only store offers an overwhelming variety of products and shoppers love bagging great bargains and hidden treasures, but with thousands of items on sale every day, it's inevitable some might not quite hit the mark. Here are 10 Costco products members either regret buying or would simply never purchase again.\n\nBaked Goods\n\nCostco offers a bewildering variety of baked goods, both from their own bakery and packaged name brands. The problem for some shoppers is that in typical Costco fashion, the content per package is gigantic and either encourages overconsumption or goes bad before it can be finished. \"I go out of my way not to buy baked goods there,\" one Redditor said. \"I occasionally make exceptions (like pumpkin pie) but I just can't have 36 enormous delicious cookies around me. I can't have a 9 pound cheesecake.\"\n\nBananas\n\nMany shoppers are unhappy with the Costco bananas. \"I can't eat such large quantities before they go bad. Fresh green/string beans\u2026same problem,\" one Redditor said. \"I have a toddler and we parents eat bananas too. My problem is Costco bananas stays green 2 days and it goes from yellow to brown in a day. Walmart ones stay yellow for at least 3 days before going brown. I am not sure what's wrong with Costco bananas. I am looking answer for this since long [ago],\" another said.\n\nThe 10 Craziest Things Customers Have Returned To Costco\n\nCream Cheese\n\nCostco's own-brand cream cheese comes under criticism as well, with customers frustrated with the packaging. \"Kirkland cream cheese can go die in the fires of hell. Philly only, so I make trips to Sam's for the value pack,\" one Redditor said. \"We bought cream cheese there once thinking it was separated out, like their butter. No. Just a giant block of cream cheese. I'm pretty sure only professional bakeries have a need to buy the giant thing of cream cheese at Costco as no family/one person could ever get through it before going bad,\" one shopper said.\n\nFresh Produce\n\nThere are a litany of complaints about Costco's produce being too expensive and going bad too fast. \"My Costco produce also sucks, much of it is rotten or nearly there,\" one person posted on Reddit. \"If I buy grapes, after digging through the stack for some that aren't visibly moldy or crushed, I'll bring them home to find the center molded. Bananas are split and flies buzzing. I buy my produce elsewhere, for sure.\" Another shopper also pointed out the rotting issue. \"We've noticed that when we buy non-refrigerated produce from Costco, we end up with fruit flies. Since we quit buying produce there, we haven't had an issue.\"\n\nI Tried 10 K-Cup Coffee Brands & the Best Was Smooth, Strong and Cheap\n\nTires\n\nNot everyone likes Costco's tires or the service. \"Once I noticed they sell tires at Costco, I got a membership. Then I needed tires one random day but noticed they actually do not have tires in stock, it takes 3 to 4 days for the tires to show up so I had no choice to go somewhere else,\" one member said.\n\nBeans and Legumes\n\nMore than one Costco member has pointed out the beans in store are overpriced and not worth the money. \"Chickpeas and black beans. Name brand in bulk is more expensive than store brand,\" one person commented on Reddit. \"Beans I priced out and they are not cheaper than other stores. I think they came out to over $1 a can and you can definitely get even organic beans less than that,\" said another.\n\nToilet Paper\n\nShoppers have very strong opinions about the Kirkland brand toilet paper. \"Kirkland brand toilet paper. It is TERRIBLE. (I do, however, buy Charmin TP there.),\" one person commented on Reddit. \"Kirkland used to be good. I actually started buying it when I tried to find the TP they used in their restrooms, and it was their brand. Now it sucks. So linty. I buy Walmart's Great Value Ultra Strong now, except when Costco has a sale recently on Charmin, which made it cheaper. I bought two 30 packs. I probably won't have to buy TP for a year,\" another said. Apparently the toilet paper quality differs across the nation, with quality dipping in certain locations, members claim.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\n\nCostco Shoppers Frustrated by Low-Quality Produce: 'Lots of Moldy, Soft Stuff'\n\nBody Wash\n\nOne shopper said the Kirkland Citrus Body Wash gave them \"nasty hives\". Another says the formula has changed. \"Used to be a different color and smell. You missed out on the original. They changed to cheaper ingredients, so it doesn't smell as good. Used to smell like wonderful oranges,\" the Costco member said on Reddit.\n\nGas\n\nOne unhappy shopper said the Costco gas was not good quality. \"The GA Costcos have gas that has been claimed to damage engines. I was wondering what was causing my engine to run rough from time to time and the minute I finally got all the Costco gas out, my engine ran smoothly again,\" the member claimed.\n\nCar Batteries\n\nCostco's car batteries have also come under fire. \"Back when they had their own brand the warranty on them was great and you could take the dead battery in and swap it out no problem. Now that they seem to only have third party brands, I bought a battery for my car which wouldn't start it. Went to an auto parts store and got one that worked. Then went to return the bad battery, they wanted to argue that there were no returns even though I printed out and highlighted the receipt which clearly said you can return it for any reason,\" one member said.",

As Costco\u2019s board of directors had done earlier in January, Apple called for its shareholders to vote against a National Center for Public Policy Research proposal to end the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple is urging its shareholders to vote against the NCPPR proposal and three other outside proposals.\n\nThe proposal from the NCPPR claims that DEI \u201cposes litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties.\u201d\n\nApple, however, strongly responded to these claims by asserting that shareholders should vote against its proposal.\n\nApple\u2019s board of directors recommends investors vote against a shareholder proposal to abolish the company\u2019s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, according to a proxy filing.\n\n\n\nRead: https://t.co/xYaS6v1Bm9 pic.twitter.com/gNUrYfazjA \u2014 Profit (@Profitpk) January 12, 2025\n\n\u201cThe proposal is unnecessary as Apple already has a well-established compliance program and the proposal inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple\u2019s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies,\u201d Apple said.\n\nApple\u2019s opposition to a call for the company to report on ethical AI data acquisition and usage is centered on the fact that the proposal concerns OpenAI rather than Apple\u2019s proprietary Apple Intelligence system, per the company\u2019s response.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple routinely asks its shareholders to vote against external proposals. Thus, rejecting these calls, which appear to be mostly from conservative activists based on the requests, is a common practice.\n\n\u201cThe proposal does not raise any specific issues with Apple Intelligence, but instead focuses its criticisms on OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, an independent service that Apple users may choose to access, and inappropriately cites controversies related to other companies that do not involve Apple,\u201d the company stated in response to the call for an ethical AI report.\n\nIn a recent interview with WIRED, Apple CEO Tim Cook indicated that user privacy and security within the company\u2019s AI structure are top of mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always consider the privacy implications. We don\u2019t accept that there\u2019s a trade-off between great privacy and great intelligence. Much of Apple Intelligence runs on the device, but for some users we need more powerful models. So we crafted private cloud compute that essentially has the same privacy and security as your device does. We just kept plugging at it until we came up with the right idea,\u201d Cook, who recently donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s upcoming inauguration, told the outlet.\n\nApple also opposes a report on costs and benefits of child sex abuse material-identifying software and user privacy and a report on charitable giving for similar reasons; in its recommendations for shareholders to vote against those reports, it cited the company\u2019s commitment to protecting data and children, respective to each report.\n\nRegarding the child abuse report, Apple declared, \u201cWe believe that our current approach to child safety, which is informed by stakeholder engagement, is more appropriate than the universal surveillance suggested in the proposal, which could have serious implications for our users\u2019 human and civil rights globally.\u201d\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Costco Refuses To Buckle To Pressure From Conservatives To Ditch DEI",

Some progress was made on seniority rights, the role of shop stewards, and other critical provisions. However, Costco has yet to propose an economic package that reflects its record-breaking profits or includes increased retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some strides at the table this week, but we remain far apart on economic issues,\u201d said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. \u201cOur goal is to secure a fair tentative agreement, but if Costco continues to ignore the value of our members\u2019 labor, we are prepared to strike to win what they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe National Negotiating Committee presented a comprehensive economic proposal two weeks ago, but Costco has yet to respond with a meaningful counteroffer addressing higher wages, improved retirement benefits, bereavement policies, holidays, or inclement weather provisions.\n\n\u201cCostco\u2019s record-breaking profits are built on our hard work,\u201d said Lance Knowles, a worker at Costco in New Jersey and a member of Local 210. \u201cIf Costco wants to call itself a \u2018\u2019pro-worker\u2019 company, it\u2019s time to prove it at the bargaining table. They can more than afford the wages we\u2019re asking for, and we\u2019re ready to strike if they refuse to deliver.\u201d\n\nNext week, Costco Teamsters will vote on a strike authorization and hold practice pickets at locations nationwide. The final round of negotiations will take place near Costco\u2019s corporate headquarters in Issaquah, Washington, beginning January 20.\n\nThe Costco National Master Agreement expires on January 31 and covers over 18,000 Teamsters nationwide. Despite announcing record-breaking profits of $7.4 billion in 2024 \u2013 a 135 percent increase from 2018 \u2013 Costco has failed to offer wages and benefits that reflect its historical financial success. Workers are demanding the strongest possible contract and will be forced to strike if a fair contract is not presented by the contract deadline.\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

They're much larger than any others you'll find at traditional grocery stores, and of course they come in a super-sized quantity, perfect for feeding a crowd ham and cheese croissants or making several breakfast casseroles. We even selected them as our favorite store-bought croissant in a head-to-head taste test with other croissants.\n\nSo when I spotted all-new croissants in Costco's bakery, imagine how quickly I rushed to pick up a box and try one. (I might have set a land-speed record.)\n\nNow in Costcos, you'll find almond croissants, a decidedly sweeter pastry than the original croissants. And instead of the traditional crescent shape, these are round and stacked extra tall. (From my estimation, they're made in the same pan as Costco's famous over-sized muffins.)\n\nOnce you get a bite or two into the buttery layers, you'll find that the croissant is filled with what Costco calls an \"almond filling\" and sliced almonds. Each is also topped with (depending on the box you get) a healthy dusting of powdered sugar or a meager one (add more if your own, in that case).\n\nI tried the croissant at room temperature, right out of the box. These pastries are every bit as flaky as you'd hope. The outside layers shatter at first bite. The almond filling has a true marzipan flavor, so if you swoon for sweet almond-sugar dough, you will want to buy two boxes of these croissants. The bits of almond are a nice textural contrast to the buttery, sugary filling and pastry.\n\nTo be honest, I had hoped for more of a custard filling, something a bit creamier against the croissant, but the almond filling manages to not be dense or chewy.\n\nKimberly Holland/Southern Living\n\nCostco members who've already spotted and snatched up a box of these croissants seem to agree with us in their positive praises. The creators of @costcoguide on Instagram described these as \"incredible\" and \"perfection.\"\n\nOne commenter suggested warming the pastry in the microwave for 30 seconds. \"They are delish,\" they wrote.\n\nA box of six croissant pastries is just shy of $12, making each one just about $2. That's an unbeatable bargain, especially considering how large each pastry is. I honestly was only able to eat half before I was entirely too full.\n\nIf you're a Costco loyalist, you may think these are not in fact new, but let me assure you they are. Some people are confusing the almond croissants for the almond danishes, which have been around (intermittently) for several years\u2014and I did spot those with the other danishes a table over from the croissants at my store in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. These are all-new and never released before, so if you need a reason to hop in the car and hit the warehouse store this weekend, here's a good one.",

            "content": "I'm certain that many readers have shopped at either Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) or Home Depot (HD -4.19%) -- or both -- at least once. These two retailers have generated combined revenue of $407 billion in their latest fiscal years. And over the long term, they have both generated strong returns for shareholders.\n\nIf we view things with a fresh perspective, which of these top retail stocks is the better one to buy right now?\n\nA minimal threat of disruption\n\nInvestors looking for businesses they could hold for the long haul should prioritize companies that have staying power -- ones that face a minimal threat of disruption. Costco and Home Depot fit the bill here.\n\nThese two brick-and-mortar retailers have been around for decades, essentially doing the exact same thing they have always done. For investors, this is compelling because it adds a level of predictability and stability.\n\nContrast that with the constantly changing tech landscape, where making long-term bets can be difficult because it's hard to know how things will shake out. What's more, top talent and huge amounts of capital flow to tech-driven industries, making competition intense.\n\nThat's not the case with the retail sector, particularly for a warehouse club operator like Costco or a home improvement chain like Home Depot. Their dominant industry positions discourage new entrants.\n\nThese two companies aren't remaining static, either. It's quite the opposite approach: Costco and Home Depot have e-commerce operations. And they both use technology in various ways to improve their operations.\n\nNonetheless, I would argue that both businesses will still be around 50 years from now, doing what they currently do.\n\nOne thrives, one struggles\n\nThese two companies should be on every investor's watch list based on their staying power, but they're operating on different wavelengths.\n\nCostco's business is humming along nicely. Net sales rose 5% in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1, 2024).\n\nAnd it expanded its membership base by 7.3% year over year to 76.2 million in that 52-week period. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported an impressive 90.5% worldwide renewal rate, indicating strong customer retention.\n\nThose memberships provide a high-margin revenue stream for Costco, driving financial performance despite selling merchandise at very low margins. Plus, they encourage customer loyalty and repeat purchases.\n\nAt the same time, Home Depot has hit a bit of a rough patch. Because the business operates adjacent to the housing market, it's been hurt by higher interest rates and the inflationary pressures facing consumers in recent years. Same-store sales are expected to dip 2.5% in fiscal 2024, which ends in a few weeks.\n\nBut Home Depot is the clear leader in its industry, a market that management estimates to be worth $1 trillion. An aging housing stock, coupled with a shortage of housing inventory, should support long-term demand. It also helps that interest rates have been coming down.\n\nPay attention to valuation\n\nOne crucial variable to consider is a stock's valuation. As of this writing, Costco shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 54. The stock has rarely been more expensive in its entire history. That leaves investors with a zero margin of safety.\n\nMost readers would agree that Costco is the superior business out of these two, since it keeps reporting solid financial results no matter the economy. However, paying more than 50 times earnings, no matter how great the company is, looks like a clear mistake. Expectations remain elevated, with the investment community viewing the business very optimistically.\n\nHome Depot, on the other hand, trades at a P/E of 26. Investors have to be patient for things to improve, but this stock is the better buy.",

The changes are mandated by the Food and Drug Administration and here's what those changes will mean for you as you peruse the aisles of your favorite store.\n\nPhoto by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images Photo by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images loading...\n\nAccording to the soon-to-be-in-place guidelines from the FDA in order for a food to be considered \"healthy\" it must:\n\n1: Contain a certain amount of food from at least one of the food groups or subgroups (such as fruit, vegetables, grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy and protein foods) recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\n2: Meet specific limits for added sugars, saturated fat and sodium.\n\nWhile that might look confusing at first blush it really isn't. For example, there are some foods that you already know are \"healthy\" and will be labelled as such without hesitation. Those items include water, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, avocados, nuts and seeds, and higher-fat fish, such as salmon, and olive oil.\n\nLucky Charms Joe Raedle, Getty Images loading...\n\nConversely, some foods that might seem healthy but really aren't won't be able to carry the word \"healthy\" on their label. Foods like highly sweetened cereals and yogurts and fortified white bread.\n\nYou can also expect more stringent and precise labels to be presented for supplements, vitamins, and other products that promise a health benefit. The change should be good for consumers who are actively trying to modify their lifestyle to be more healthy.\n\nKayla Maurais via Unsplash.com Kayla Maurais via Unsplash.com loading...\n\nBut remember the mandated changes aren't required to be in place for another three years. So, you still have a lot of time to have the wool pulled over your eyes by products that would like you to believe they are beneficial for your good health. Become an informed shopper and know before you go.",

            "content": "Few commodities can dodge inevitable price rises but every once in a while there are some surprising contenders. For one, bananas seem largely untouched by inflation. And, for a completely different reason, so does Costco's hot dog combo. The iconic $1.50 soda and hot dog deal has remained the same price since its introduction in the mid-1980s and has now become more than just a food combo. It is synonymous with the food court's more-for-less strategy and is a public relations goldmine for the warehouse chain. However, considering the wild amount of hot dogs Costco sells, the retail giant has had to take some big steps to keep its hot dog prices low.\n\nIt all started with a Hebrew National hot dog cart outside one of the first Costco outlets and the company continued to source franks from the hot dog maker until supplies fell short. This led Costco to take the dramatic step of bringing production in-house \u2014 a move that's not very common amongst retail giants. While several Kirkland products are sourced from other manufacturers, Costco's Kirkland hot dogs are produced in the retail giant's own factories. Not only has this helped maintain the $1.50 price, but it has also allowed Costco to actually increase the size of the hot dogs it serves. And while Kirkland hot dogs may still not be a money maker, the company has taken other measures to offset the cost of keeping the price iconically low.\n\nRead more: 11 Rules You're Probably Breaking When Using The Self-Checkout\n\nCostco's Kirkland Brand Hot Dogs Are Made In-House\n\nKirkland beef hot dogs - The Image Party/Shutterstock\n\nHebrew National was Costco's original hot dog supplier when the retail giant introduced the hot dog combo in 1985. However, rising costs and pressure from Costco's founder Jim Sinegal to keep the hot dog price unchanged forced then-CEO Craig Jeline to bring hot dog production in-house. The first Kirkland hot dog factory was subsequently set up outside Los Angeles, with another one later in the Chicago area. Costco's annual production and sales of hot dogs, unsurprisingly, are in the millions. Interestingly, unlike the Hebrew National ones, which were kosher, the Kirkland Signature hot dogs are not kosher.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe behemoth undertaking of setting up production plants shows just how serious Costco is about keeping that combo price fixed. The drinks have changed from cans to a cheaper fountain alternative, but even so the retail giant doesn't expect to make much profit from hot dog sales. In fact, it offers free toppings (which can upgrade your Costco food court purchase) that are specifically focused on the hot dog combo.\n\nAll of these efforts are a bid to hold customer loyalty that seems to be working. To get the low-priced hot dogs (and other food court and store offerings), 90% of Costco shoppers continue to renew their memberships to the warehouse retail chain, paying anywhere from $60 to $120 annually. Ultimately, Costco continues to enjoy its consumer-centric image while the rest of us can enjoy experimenting with combinations like the viral Costco hot dog hack.\n\nRead the original article on Foodie.",

A final city vote is tentatively planned for the Jan. 28 City Council meeting. Pictured, a current Costco location in Plainfield. (Gary Middendorf)\n\nThe proposed Costco in Yorkville passed another city planning hurdle, despite some residents voicing concerns during a public hearing that the influx of shoppers could lead to traffic nightmares.\n\nThe planned Costco was approved by the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission on Jan. 8, including a special use variance for a proposed gas fueling facility. The Costco plan layout designs also received unanimous approval.\n\nAccording to city documents, the proposed site is on 43.54 acres at the northwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway in the Yorkville Crossing development area. The plan includes the 160,000 square-foot retail store, a gas fueling facility, perimeter lots, and lots designated for stormwater management.\n\nDuring the public hearing before the commission approvals, several residents said they supported bringing Costco to Yorkville, but were concerned about traffic congestion in the area.\n\nYorkville resident Jeff Burke, lives in the Prairie Meadows neighborhood north of the proposed site and suggested installing traffic control devices at the intersections of McHugh and Kennedy roads and McHugh Road and Marketview Drive.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is traffic along the queue, which runs on the west side of our subdivision,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI see Kennedy Road and McHugh Road becoming significantly busier.\u201d\n\nMarcia Ayala, also of the Prairie Meadows neighborhood, said she was concerned that the increased traffic from the retail store and the gas station in the dense and small area could pose a potential risk to the safety and health of the community.\n\n\u201cThe northwest corner is only 0.2 miles from a baseball field where families park their cars for their children to play on the field and in the park,\u201d Ayala said at the meeting. \u201cPeople ride their bikes and high school cross country runs in that area. People walk their dogs around that area. There\u2019s a bike path on Veterans Parkway that people use to ride in a safe area that will be right in front of the Costco.\u201d\n\nTo mitigate some traffic and congestion concerns, the planned development contains six vehicular access points, including three along Countryside Parkway, one along Veterans Parkway, and two along the queue.\n\nAn updated site plan now aligns with a traffic study conducted by the city engineer that recommends a modification of a traffic signal at the intersection of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway and the entrance to the Costco parking area. The city is awaiting feedback from the Illinois Department of Transportation on the results of the study.\n\nA commission-approved amendment to the city code permits 956 parking stalls parking stalls. The original city code for the site only allowed a maximum of 387 parking stalls.\n\nThe current property owner of the site is Joda Land Holding, LLC.\n\nThe final vote for city approval is tentatively scheduled for the Jan. 28 city council meeting.\n\nCostco representatives said they are looking for an incentives agreement with full details coming before the Jan. 28 City Council meeting.",

Businesses in South College Station shared split opinions on how they expect the retail and restaurant development plans to impact their operations.\n\n\u201cI feel like that development will bring more people to South College Station and that could be beneficial to us, but like I said, the competition is gonna increase,\u201d explained Kyra Glover, a hostess at MARFA Texas Kitchen.\n\nThe real estate in College Station\u2019s plan for development includes 13 acres between Costco and Corporate Drive on HWY 6. Corinth Group developers still have an opportunity to purchase 15 more acres for any future plans.\n\nCollege Station City Council approves development plans proposed by Corinth Group in January 9 meeting (KBTX)\n\nThe owners at Hyperbole Bookstore said they see a growing number of businesses as an opportunity to collaborate. They think new developments will bring more foot traffic to South College Station that all businesses can benefit from.\n\n\u201cI think the more they fill up, the more we can pair with other people in the area,\u201d Kathy Miller said, Hyperbole Bookstore Co-owner, \u201cand really, just build this as a destination- a shopping destination, which I think is what we\u2019d love to be.\u201d\n\nSouth College Station business expects new area developments to help bring in more customers\n\nSydney Welsh, Owner of MARFA Texas Kitchen, told KBTX populations are not growing at the same rate as restaurants around College Station. With fewer customers and more competition, they expect development to harm their business.\n\n\u201cIf we have more competition and the same population, I feel as though it\u2019s gonna get a little more difficult for restaurants in College Station, businesses in general in South College Station, just because it\u2019s just so much competition and not enough customers,\u201d added Glover.\n\nBoth businesses acknowledged growth in the area is a good sign for South College Station.\n\nCopyright 2025 KBTX.

Costco has not responded to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cOur national negotiating committee is fully committed to securing an agreement with Costco, but the company has shown little interest in working constructively to reach a fair deal,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean O\u2019Brien. \u201cWith less than a month until the contract expires, the company should be working overtime to reach a fair agreement, not walking away from negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe union has submitted what it calls a comprehensive economic proposal reflecting a 135% increase in profits but claims Costco\u2019s counter proposal does not include a fair wage increase or improvements to retirement benefits.\n\nCostco is also refusing to meet for scheduled bargaining sessions and has reduced talks from five days a week to just three, according to the Teamsters.\n\nCostco reported net sales of $27.52 billion in December, marking a 9.9% year-over-year increase.

At less than $0.50 per can, it was arguably a risky purchase from the get-go. But while it gained a few pitiful brownie points for its low price tag, the beer's abysmal taste doomed it as a non-starter. Kirkland Signature finally pulled the plug in 2018 \u2014 adding the beverage to a long list of discontinued Costco products we may never eat (or drink) again. And with that, we waved goodbye to the notorious beer. In hindsight, $22 for a 48-pack really was too good to be true.\n\nOasis might have sung, \"Don't look back in anger,\" but they probably hadn't tasted Kirkland Light Beer. It's safe to say that the drink still invokes strong reactions from previous customers. Nobody held back on one particular Reddit thread, which rapidly accrued almost 4k upvotes in two days. \"Barf. I swear it tasted like pond water with Necco wafers dissolved in it,\" typed a disgusted commenter. Another revealed: \"I am not a proud man. I will drink Coors light, natty light, warm beer, opened beer, someone else's beer. This might have been the only beer I have ever thrown away whatever was left.\" The verdict hasn't changed.

SMART is a group of law enforcement investigators and community members who respond to police use-of-force incidents.\n\nDuring the stop, an \u201caltercation\u201d took place, police said, and the officer was dragged by the suspect\u2019s vehicle. The suspect, according to SMART, then drove into the Costco building at 16822 Twin Lakes Ave, at which point the vehicle caught on fire.\n\nA Marysville police officer fired shots during the incident, the release said. The suspect, whose identity has not been released, died at the scene. The officer dragged by the suspect\u2019s vehicle sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe Snohomish County Medical Examiner\u2019s office will determine the cause and manner of death, the release said.\n\nAround 9 p.m. Tuesday, Marysville police posted about the incident on X.\n\n\u201cOfficers are okay and the suspect is accounted for,\u201d the post said.\n\nBy 10 p.m., police had blocked access to the Lakewood Crossing shopping center while they investigated. A visibly burned car could be seen resting against the side of the building. Videos on social media appeared to show flames shooting from a car in front of Costco.\n\nBusinesses in the area underwent a lockdown as a precautionary measure, but there is no current threat to public safety, SMART said.\n\nTuesday marks the first incident under investigation by SMART this year. In 2024, SMART detectives investigated five use-of-force cases involving police.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misidentified SMART as a group of detectives who investigate use-of-force cases. SMART is made up of law enforcement investigators, evidence technicians, records specialists and public information officers, as well as community representatives.\n\nMichael Henneke: 425-339-3431; michael.henneke@heraldnet.com; X: @ihenpecked.\n\nWill Geschke: 425-339-3443; william.geschke@heraldnet.com; X: @willgeschke.",

The service also made 196,000 deliveries in the week prior to the earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe are now able to predeploy things around the U.S. and have deliveries made in four days, which a couple of years ago would have taken us two weeks,\u201d President and CEO Ron Vachris said.\n\nThe recent surge builds on growth during fiscal 2024 for Costco Logistics. The service delivered more than 4.5 million big-and-bulky items during fiscal 2024, up 29% from the prior fiscal year, Vachris said during a Q4 earnings call in September.\n\nWith the company continuing to improve delivery times and scheduling functionality, Vachris said in September that big-and-bulky items would continue to be critical to its e-commerce growth in 2025.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Food Delivery and the Bottom Line, from the editorial teams at C-Store Dive, Grocery Dive, Supply Chain Dive and Restaurant Dive.

The $1 billion acquisition of the middle- and last-mile carrier enabled Costco to bring big-and-bulky deliveries in-house after contracting the delivery of some larger items to Innovel since 2015.",

            "content": "Shares of Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) jumped 38.8% in 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The famous membership-based retailer had another solid year opening new stores and growing its footprint in the e-commerce market. Now one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of over $400 billion, Costco is firing on all cylinders and generating annual sales of $260 billion.\n\nHere's why the stock was higher yet again in 2024.\n\nDominant retail model\n\nCostco's retail model gives it a dominant and reinforcing competitive position. With membership-based pricing and bargain prices on bulk items, more and more people around the world are becoming habitual Costco shoppers. Last quarter, Costco's revenue in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 grew 5.7% year over year to $94 billion. The United States business is still doing quite well with 6% revenue growth, which shows the amount of room Costco has to grow as it expands into new markets around the globe.\n\nE-commerce revenue grew 17.1% in the quarter, or more than triple its overall revenue growth. In order to compete with Amazon and Walmart, Costco will need to increase its e-commerce presence in the years to come.\n\nCostco's stock returns also benefited from broad market growth and expansion of its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. The stock started the year with a P/E of 45 and finished with a P/E of approximately 54, which juices its stock returns for the year.\n\nIs the stock a buy in 2025?\n\nOne of the best businesses in the world, Costco has historically traded at a P/E that is a premium to the market average. This is due to its consistent earnings growth and rock-solid business model.\n\nHowever, the stock looks overly expensive. The P/E is close to its highest level of the last 10 years and well off its 10-year average of 36. Costco is also a much larger business today than it was 10 years ago. With $260 billion in annual sales, it will be hard for Costco to grow quickly in the years ahead. Combined with the risk of stock-price headwinds if its P/E reverts to its long-term average, I think Costco stock is a risky bet at these prices.\n\nCostco stock has been a long-term stock market winner, and I don't fault anyone for holding shares at nosebleed prices. But today doesn't look like a promising buying opportunity for the membership-based retail giant.",

This refusal to negotiate highlights Costco\u2019s ongoing failure to bargain in good faith and underscores a troubling shift in the company\u2019s corporate culture that prioritizes profits over the well-being of its employees.\n\n\u201cOur national negotiating committee is fully committed to securing an agreement with Costco, but the company has shown little interest in working constructively to reach a fair deal,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M O\u2019Brien. \u201cIn the middle of a workday, Costco walked away from the bargaining table. With less than a month until the contract expires, the company should be working overtime to reach a fair agreement \u2014 not walking away from negotiations.\u201d\n\nDespite reporting record-breaking profits in 2024, Costco has rejected the Teamsters\u2019 comprehensive economic proposal. Costco recently announced annual net profits of $7.4 billion \u2014 up from $6.3 billion last year and a staggering 135 percent increase from $3.1 billion in 2018. These soaring profits are only possible because of the tireless work of Costco employees, who deserve a contract that reflects their critical role in the company\u2019s success. The company has offered a counterproposal that fails to reflect its historic financial success and provides no increased retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cThe games Costco is playing at the bargaining table are reckless and shortsighted,\u201d said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. \u201cOur committee is ready to negotiate every single day. Half-hearted efforts and half-days won\u2019t cut it this close to the contract deadline. It\u2019s time for Costco to get serious and engage in meaningful negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe Teamsters represent more than 18,000 Costco workers nationwide. With the Costco Teamsters National Master Agreement set to expire on January 31, workers are demanding a contract that reflects their contributions to the company\u2019s success \u2014 and they are prepared to strike if necessary.\n\n\u201cNothing we\u2019re asking for is unreasonable. We simply want what we\u2019ve earned,\u201d said John Robledo, a Costco worker in Carson and a Local 572 shop steward. \u201cCorporate needs to step up and deliver for the people who drive its success. A strike is not our goal, but Costco is playing a dangerous game by refusing to negotiate in good faith.\u201d\n\nCostco has repeatedly undermined negotiations in recent weeks by canceling scheduled bargaining sessions. Talks between the Teamsters and Costco are set to resume today. While talks are scheduled to resume, the company remains far from offering a proposal that meets the needs of its workers.\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

Parking spaces that were filled by patrol cars just 12 hours prior were now crowded with grocery shoppers.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect Costco to be open today,\u201d Clark told KIRO Newsradio.\n\nHe and Reid were driving with their children Tuesday night when they saw the massive police response from multiple city departments.\n\n\u201cWe figured something\u2019s got to be on and popping,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe saw all the smoke pluming and then more cops were shutting down the block in the area.\u201d\n\nThat led the couple to tell their children it was time to go home \u2014 and stay home.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if (the suspect) ran from police so we were going to stay inside with the doors locked and the windows closed,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt was bedtime for (the kids) anyways, so we told them when they woke up that everything would be safe again.\u201d\n\nBy late Wednesday, investigators still hadn\u2019t identified the suspect in Tuesday\u2019s alleged fight with police.

On January 2, Costco recalled its Kirkland Signature brand Severe Cold & Flu Plus Congestion capsules due to potential contamination.\n\nThe pills were marketed as a \u201cCool Breeze\u201d variant and contained both daytime and nighttime capsules. The recall said the packages bear item number 1729556 and would have been purchased between October 30, 2024 and November 30, 2024.

Viruses that are a part of the spike include COVID-19, influenza, and RSV.\n\n\n\nIf you think you may have a respiratory virus and exhibit symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, cough, and runny nose, the CDC recommends staying home and away from others, washing your hands properly, and sanitizing frequently touched surfaces. Depending on the type of respiratory illness you have, you should be able to hasten recovery with proper vaccination, rest, hydration, non-recalled cold medication, and if you need, you can talk to your doctor about anti-viral prescription drugs.",

Instead, the wholesale giant offered an insulting counterproposal that fails to reflect its historic financial success and provides no increased retirement benefits \u2014 a shameful disregard for the hardworking employees who make the company\u2019s success possible.\n\n\u201cCostco executives are padding their pockets while trying to leave workers behind,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien. \u201cThe Teamsters are not impressed with the company\u2019s arrogance at the bargaining table. Record profits demand record contracts. If Costco doesn\u2019t get serious about respecting its employees, this company will own any labor dispute it forces come February 1.\u201d\n\nCostco recently announced annual net profits of $7.4 billion \u2014 up from $6.3 billion last year and a staggering 135 percent increase from $3.1 billion in 2018. These soaring profits are only possible because of the tireless work of Costco employees, who deserve a contract that reflects their critical role in the company\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t complicated \u2014 a 135 percent increase in profits should translate to significant wage increases,\u201d said Tom Erickson, Teamsters Warehouse Division Director. \u201cCostco is putting profits ahead of workers. When a company is this rich, that success belongs to the people who make it happen and not some executives sitting comfortably inside corporate offices.\u201d\n\nThe Teamsters represent over 18,000 Costco workers nationwide. The Costco Teamsters National Master Agreement expires January 31. Costco Teamsters are demanding the strongest possible contract and are prepared to strike if the company fails to deliver.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to strike, but if Costco continues to insult us with unrealistic and disrespectful wage proposals, we will have no choice,\u201d said Ed Swank, a Costco worker in San Diego and Teamsters Local 542 shop steward. \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to the picket line because of this company\u2019s greed, Costco will only be striking itself. The damage to its once proud, \u2018pro-worker\u2019 reputation will be irreparable unless the company gets serious at the bargaining table.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

            "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWith its recent rejection of a shareholder proposal that challenged its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Costco didn\u2019t actually break new ground. Even as anti-DEI campaigns have surged, most companies have held on to their diversity policies because they foster good decision-making and are conducive to their business goals.\n\nHowever, the statement from Costco\u2019s board of directors, urging shareholders to reject the proposal and combating some of its specifics, was notable in its forcefulness, experts say.\n\nIt was especially striking given high-profile moves last year by major companies, including retailers like Tractor Supply and Walmart, to retreat from their DEI programs, according to Dave Marcotte, senior vice president at Kantar Retail.\n\n\u201cOverall this provides a media narrative of conservatives winning over progressives which was a big theme for 2024. Costco has run directly contrary to that narrative,\u201d he said by email. \u201cAnd its formal response to an investor tactic (\u2018DEI raises stockholder risk\u2019), is a statement that [not only] refutes the premise but also states that these investors are not doing so in the interest of Costco but a larger political agenda. As the 5th largest retailer in the world, this is a loud statement.\u201d\n\n\"As the 5th largest retailer in the world, this is a loud statement.\u201d Dave Marcotte Senior Vice President, Kantar Retail\n\nIt came last month, within Costco\u2019s 2024 proxy statement, in response to the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank and Costco shareholder. The group had submitted a proposal to be considered for the company\u2019s annual meeting, requesting \u201cthat the Board conduct an evaluation and publish a report, omitting proprietary and privileged information, on the risks of the Company maintaining its current DEI (including \u2018People & Communities\u2019) roles, policies and goals.\u201d\n\nNCPPR cited recent lawsuits challenging DEI at companies; the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s rollback of affirmative action in college admissions; and the fact that several companies have retreated from their DEI efforts. \u201cIt's clear that DEI holds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the Company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders,\u201d the organization stated.\n\nBut Costco\u2019s board of directors unanimously recommended a vote against this. The board expressed confidence in the company\u2019s adherence to the law and thereby rejected any worry about litigation, and defended its diversity policies as good for its relationships with customers, suppliers and employees. The latter in turn has rewarded its shareholders, Costco also said.\n\nMoreover, the board didn\u2019t end with a defensive posture. It went on to argue that NCPPR is concerned less about Costco\u2019s business or shareholders and more about its own political agenda, namely, the \u201cabolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d Costco also corrected the record on some NCPPR claims, calling them \u201cmisleading, at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs,\u201d the board wrote.\n\nWhile vigorous and direct, Costco\u2019s response was also careful and specific, according to Alison Taylor, professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of \u201cHigher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World.\u201d Some DEI critics have seized on inconclusive research regarding whether strong DEI efforts accrue to the bottom line, but Costco avoided making profitability claims and stuck to other valid business reasons, she said by phone.\n\n\u201cIt is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs.\" Costco Board of Directors 2024 Proxy Statement\n\n\u201cThere are very mixed studies on the business case for diversity, but they're not getting into those business case arguments particularly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made the case around their culture and their values and what their customers want, and that I think was very defensible.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s move comes as many companies are hearing from both their legal and marketing departments that defending DEI policies could be costly, according to Taylor. But ditching DEI may not be as wise a response as it seems, and the future is uncertain. For example, if the incoming Trump administration further emboldens anti-DEI proponents, that could provoke a backlash, especially as Gen Z increasingly enters the workforce, she said.\n\n\u201cI think there's this kind of misunderstanding, that in some way kowtowing to Starbuck and these people reduces your risk,\u201d she said, referencing Robby Starbuck, a conservative provocateur who has taken credit for many recent DEI rollbacks. \u201cThat is not certain \u2014 there\u2019s no neat way to get rid of your risk here.\u201d\n\nHow might this play out in 2025?\n\nIn a way, this \u201cclear brand statement from Costco\u201d is par for the course for the retailer, according to Marcotte. The company has a long track record of sticking to what it sees as keys to its success, including among the best pay and other working conditions in the industry, despite grumbling from shareholders, he said.\n\n\u201cDEI in this context is the same, in that they see it as part of a successful model and, in character, react bluntly to being told what to do,\u201d he said, adding that the company\u2019s protection of its DEI policy is unlikely to dent its strong membership retention or domestic and international growth.\n\nIt may impress other companies, if only to influence them \u201cto simply ignore the anti-DEI as one more political movement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much reporting about this, everyone\u2019s just kind of toeing the line, and there\u2019s nothing to be done. So I think this does kind of freshen up the debate.\" Alison Taylor Author, \u201cHigher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Costco has provided a road map for navigating the DEI controversy that doesn\u2019t only lead to capitulation, according to Taylor.\n\n\u201cIt kind of resets the conversation in some way. There's been so much reporting about this, everyone's just kind of toeing the line, and there's nothing to be done. So I think this does kind of freshen up the debate,\u201d she said. \u201cOther companies may follow through because Costco gives them a bit of top cover. Whoever goes first takes the flak, right? So I think it kind of gives a license and opens up a space to say that there's a different way to handle this.\u201d",

We believe that it fosters creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer our members.\u201d\n\nConsumers continue to flock to the club retailer, as made evident in its first-quarter performance. The company posted a 7.5% increase in net sales, hitting $60.99 billion for the 12-week period ending Nov. 24, and boosted same-store sales by 7.1%. Traffic was up 4.9% in the United States, while earnings per share (EPS) came in at $4.04 versus the expected $3.79.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco believes NCPPR's request to evaluate its DEI efforts would not be an efficient use of company resources. Further, the board claims that NCPPR\u2019s proposal masks its true anti-diversity agenda under the guise of reducing risk.\n\n\u201cThe proponent professes concern about legal and financial risks to the company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe supporting statement demonstrates that it is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs. The proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d\n\nHowever, Costco could face backlash for its refusal to dismantle its DEI policies. According to Newsweek, the club retailer is facing threats of a boycott from supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. Project 2025, a series of policies supported by several backers of the incoming Trump administration, lists abolishing DEI practices in both the public and private sectors among the core goals of the next conservative government. After Costco defended its current policies, some Trump supporters called for a boycott on social media.\n\nBy standing by its DEI commitments, Costco is setting itself apart from other major companies that have eliminated DEI roles and initiatives as a result of pressure from conservative groups. For example, Walmart said in November that it is withdrawing DEI programs. America\u2019s biggest retailer joins Tractor Supply, Lowe\u2019s, Ford, Harley-Davidson and Molson Coors in discontinuing DEI efforts.\n\nNCPPR\u2019s DEI proposal will be voted on at Costco\u2019s annual shareholders meeting to be held by live webcast on Thursday, Jan. 23, at 2:00 p.m.\n\nWith more than 300,000 employees around the globe, Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco operates approximately 900 warehouses, including 600-plus in the United States and Puerto Rico,100-plus in Canada and 41 in Mexico. The company is No. 3 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer\u2019s 2024 list of the top food and consumables retailers in North America. PG also named Costco among its Retailers of the Century. Additionally, the club retailer's commitment to diversity has recently garnered attention: Costco earned a spot on Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity 2025 list.",

            "content": "While you probably already know Costco is a great place to find deals on all kinds of foods from large tubs of hummus to enough fish to feed three families for the price of one, you might not know the warehouse membership store is a virtual treasure trove beyond the food aisles. This is especially true when it comes to items for the home.\n\nFrom the brands you love and the things you use every day to exclusive deals on appliances, you never know what you might find online as well as in the aisles. Here are seven home items you should always buy at Costco.\n\nDyson Vacuums\n\nDyson vacuums are pricey for a good reason. They have excellent suction at adjustable levels, lots of accessories and look sleek. So, why not make the most of your Costco membership and get those discounts? With exclusive pricing, you won't regret adding one to your cart. In addition to vacuums, Costco also offers members-only pricing on the coveted Supersonic Hair Dryer and Airwrap.\n\nArt Televisions\n\nArt televisions have become increasingly popular in recent years, and the Hisense Canvas stands out as one of the most budget-friendly options\u2014and it's available at Costco. Featuring a wood-like frame and a flush-to-wall design, it\u2019s one of the rare electronic devices that can truly elevate your living room. When you\u2019re not binge-watching, switch to art mode to display 120 free, hyper-realistic art pieces.\n\nTowel Sets\n\nAre your towels looking worse for the wear? Costco to the rescue! Look for the Charisma 100% Hygrocotton Towel Sets in stores, which are a steal at only $30 for two bath towels. These also make a great housewarming gift, FYI!\n\nKeep in mind that inventory can vary by store and region, though many of these items can be purchased online.\n\nComforters\n\n100% down comforters can cost a small fortune, but not at Costco. With its high rating, the Hotel Grand White Down Comforter is available in twin, full/queen, and king sizes\u2014and best of all, it's about half the price of what you'll find at other retailers. With all the money you'll save, you can feel free to splurge on a duvet cover.\n\nPillow Inserts\n\nWhen was the last time you replaced your pillows? We're not judging, but if it's been a while, it might be time to buy some new ones, and Costco has options that are a bargain. The Sealy Sterling Pure Luxury Pillow set includes two soft, breathable pillows for just $23. With firm support, you might even get a better night's sleep.\n\nGlass Food Storage Sets\n\nWhether you meal prep or always have extra leftovers, having a quality set of food storage containers not only makes life easier but helps keep your food fresher for longer. At Costco, you can snag a glass 18-piece set for $35! The Snapware Pyrex Set has airtight lids and you can use the containers in the oven. Plus, they're also refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, and microwave-safe.\n\nNespresso Machines\n\nSkip going out for coffee and make your own gourmet coffee drinks at home with the members-only Nespresso Vertuo Next Deluxe with Aeroccino. This dynamic duo can make everything from lattes to macchiatos and classic espresso shots, along with regular old cups of joe, if you prefer that.",

LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nA Costco shareholder proposal brought by a conservative activist asked the company to investigate its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, with an eye toward eliminating them.\n\nThe Issaquah, Wash.-based company's board wasn't amused with the pitch.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank, wants the company to evaluate its DEI policies.\n\nThe thrust of the proposal is that certain DEI initiatives could open Costco up to financial risks over discrimination lawsuits from employees who are \"white, Asian, male or straight,\" according to a regulatory filing that outlines what shareholders will vote on during an upcoming shareholders meeting.\n\nThe company's board of directors unanimously urged shareholders to reject the proposal. In a statement, the board cast the proposal's concerns as dubious as the company already regularly evaluates its practices, and made the case that Costco's success depends on establishing a racially diverse, inclusive workplace.\n\n\"We believe that our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are legally appropriate, and nothing in the (Center for Public Policy Research) proposal demonstrates otherwise,\" the board's statement said.\n\nThe statement went on to rebuke the Center for Public Policy Research, saying they and others were the ones responsible for inflicting financial and legal burdens on companies.\n\n\"The proponent's broader agenda is not reducing the risk for the Company but abolition of diversity programs,\" the board said.\n\nDuring an annual meeting for a public company like Costco, shareholders vote on items put forth by the company.\n\nThose usually include approving the pay for top executives and selecting board members.\n\nBut they'll also vote on shareholder proposals, which shareholders make as a request to change something about the company or to address a pressing issue the board hasn't brought up.\n\nCostco, which has more than 300,000 employees around the globe, said its diversity efforts have helped the company by fostering creativity and innovation in the merchandise it can offer to a diverse membership.\n\n\"Combined with our obedience to the law, service to our employees, members and suppliers has rewarded our shareholders,\" the board said.\n\nWhile Costco is standing firm with its DEI initiatives, other companies have recently retreated from theirs.\n\nThose shifts have occurred since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions in June 2023.\n\nThe Center for Public Policy Research proposal argues that after the ruling, corporations are open to more discrimination lawsuits.\n\nLast summer, John Deere and Tractor Supply both announced sweeping changes to their DEI efforts. John Deere said it will no longer sponsor \"social or cultural awareness\" events and Tractor Supply said it was eliminating all DEI roles and retiring its commitments.\n\nWalmart, the country's largest employer, dropped several of its diversity policies in November, including one that gave priority treatment to suppliers owned by women or people of color.\n\nThe Center for Public Policy Research proposal pointed to both John Deere and Tractor Supply as examples of companies unburdening themselves from the legal risks of DEI policies.\n\nBut it also mentioned a claim about Microsoft that swept through headlines in July.\n\nThe tech giant laid off two employees on the company's events team that worked with the talent, diversity, inclusion and learning team.\n\nIt was first reported by numerous outlets that Microsoft had axed an entire DEI team. Microsoft Chief Diversity Officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre sent an internal memo in late July that clarified the team had not been cut.\n\nThe two employees did not report to Microsoft's diversity and inclusion team and had been laid off because their roles were redundant, according to the company.\n\n\"As we move forward, our D&I commitments remain unchanged,\" said Microsoft spokesperson Jeff Jones in July. \"Our focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritizing accountability, and continuing to focus on this work.\"\n\nThe challenges to DEI policies and initiatives are likely to increase with President-elect Donald Trump entering the White House.\n\nStephen Miller, a fixture of the first Trump administration and incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, started the America First Legal Foundation, a group that has targeted corporate DEI policies.\n\nThe Center for Public Policy Research announced last year that shareholder activists involved with it were presenting proposals to American Express, Intel, General Electric, Progressive, Ford and Duke Energy.\n\nAll of them denounced DEI, decarbonization and disarmament policies.",

USA TODAY\n\nMake sure to check your refrigerator because some eggs recalled by Costco may still be chilling in there.\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Organic Pasture Raised eggs were recalled Nov. 27 by producer Handsome Brook Farms of New York because they could be contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration said at the time.\n\nIn all, the recall covered 10,800 cartons of Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs, sold in 25 Costco stores in five states. Handsome Brook Farms initiated the recall because \"eggs not intended for retail distribution were instead packaged and distributed in retail packaging,\" the company said in a news release.\n\nThe FDA later classified the situation as a Class I recall, the highest risk level for infection, suggesting \"a reasonable probability\" that a recalled product \"will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\"\n\nNo illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products.\n\nShould drinkers pay more for insurance? Surgeon general warning stirs debate\n\nWhat eggs sold at Costco were recalled?\n\nThe eggs recalled were Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs sold at Costco stores. The eggs are packaged in plastic egg cartons with the Kirkland Signature label on the top and have the UPC code 9661910680.\n\nWhere were recalled eggs sold?\n\nThe Kirkland Signature Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs were sold at 25 Costco stores in these states:\n\nAlabama\n\nGeorgia\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTennessee\n\nCould recalled eggs still be in fridges?\n\nYes, because even though they were sold beginning on Nov. 22, 2024, they carried a use-by date of Jan. 5, 2025.\n\nThe eggs should not be eaten and should be thrown away or returned to Costco for a full refund. Consumers with any questions can call 888-877-7221 Sunday-Saturday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat is a Class I recall from the FDA?\n\nThe FDA can order a recall, request a company issue one or can announce one conducted, as in this case, by the company itself. The FDA defines various levels of recalls on its website:\n\nClass I recall: Issued when there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to the product \"will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\"\n\nIssued when there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to the product \"will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\" Class II recall: Issued when the product \"may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nIssued when the product \"may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" Class III recall: Issued when a product \"is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\"\n\nIssued when a product \"is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\" Market withdrawal: This action covers minor violations not subject to FDA legal action, when \"the firm removes the product from the market or corrects the violation. For example, a product removed from the market due to tampering, without evidence of manufacturing or distribution problems, would be a market withdrawal.\"\n\nThis action covers minor violations not subject to FDA legal action, when \"the firm removes the product from the market or corrects the violation. For example, a product removed from the market due to tampering, without evidence of manufacturing or distribution problems, would be a market withdrawal.\" Medical device safety alert: This alert is \"issued in situations where a medical device may present an unreasonable risk of substantial harm. In some case, these situations also are considered recalls.\"\n\nWhat is salmonella?\n\nSalmonella is a bacteria and \u2013 as one of the leading causes of foodborne illnesses \u2013 can cause people to experience diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Symptoms can appear between six hours and six days of infection and will last for four to seven days, the CDC said.\n\nChildren younger than 5, the elderly and people who are immunosuppressed are more likely to have severe infections if they contract salmonella, the FDA said.\n\nSalmonella causes about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the U.S. annually, according to the CDC.\n\nContributing: James Powel and Ahjane\u0301 Forbes\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X: mikegsnider & @mikegsnider.bsky.social & @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

This has angered extreme fans of the incoming president, who have been in support of companies ditching their DEI policies in recent months. Let\u2019s take a look at the details of this latest controversy.\n\nCostco Faces MAGA Backlash and Boycott\n\nAccording to Newsweek, while DEI programs in the workplace became prevalent over the previous decade, they have recently faced greater scrutiny from both a legal and cultural standpoint. Several corporations have rolled back their DEI projects following boycotts spearheaded by conservative consumers, including Walmart, Tractor Supply, Ford, and Lowe\u2019s.\n\nProject 2025, a collection of proposals advocated by some proponents of the upcoming Trump administration, mentions eradicating DEI practices in both the public and commercial sectors among the major priorities of the next conservative government.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the board of directors of Costco denied calls to discontinue its DEI program, which shareholders characterized as \u201cillegal discrimination,\u201d the MAGA movement reacted negatively.\n\nThe board defended the company\u2019s current policy when a group of shareholders demanded a \u201creport on the risks of maintaining DEI efforts,\u201d stating, \u201cOur efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion follow our code of ethics.\u201d Many Trump supporters were incensed by the defense, and some even called for a boycott on social media.\n\nBut despite the blathering, Costco remains unfazed. \u201cOur Board has considered this proposal and believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company Remains Popular\n\nAs part of its efforts to remain unbothered, the company also recently announced that it will be opening more locations nationwide this year.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Costco announced six new stores opening:\n\nBrentwood, California\n\nGenesee County, Michigan\n\nHighland, California\n\nProsper, Texas (March 14)\n\nSharon, Massachusetts (March 1)\n\nWeatherford, Texas (March 15)\n\nWith the upcoming additions anticipated to open in March 2025, the membership warehousing behemoth will have more than 900 locations worldwide.\n\nTwo new stores will open in Texas, and two will open in California, where Costco opened its 897th store in Pleasanton on Nov. 27 and thousands of people stayed overnight to be among the first to enter. \u201cThe Pleasanton opening set a new Costco record for the highest-ever first-day sales for a U.S. warehouse at $2.9 million,\u201d CEO Ron Vachris said last month on a call with financial analysts.\n\nIt intends to open 29 new locations in fiscal year 2025, which concludes on Aug. 31, 2025. Of those, 26 will be new constructions, and three will be relocations.\n\nVachris said in December that 10 of the additional locations would be located outside of the U.S.\n\nHe claims that Costco opened seven additional locations during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which concluded on Nov. 24. One of these buildings was a conversion from an old retail space, while the other four were outside the United States.\n\nIn other news, the retailer might be in trouble with the Teamsters despite the company\u2019s improved growth. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters accused the big-box retailer of breaking union contracts last month and threatened to strike.\n\nThe union accused Costco of unfair labor practices for ejecting union representatives, intimidating and harassing employees for wearing Teamster apparel and buttons, and altering the locks on union bulletin boards to prevent future updates. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 18,000 Costco workers nationwide.",

(Gary Middendorf)\n\nAfter years of speculation, Costco is taking another step toward opening a Yorkville location with a scheduled public hearing to discuss the necessary planning and zoning requirements.\n\nThe hearing will take place at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 8 at City Hall, 651 Prairie Pointe Drive, Yorkville. Following the public hearing, members of the Planning and Zoning Commission will take action on whether to approve the planned development for a full City Council vote.\n\nAccording to city documents, the proposed site is at the northwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway in the Yorkville Crossing development area.\n\nThe 43.54-acre site for the proposed Costco in Yorkville is located at the northwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway in the \u201cYorkville Crossing\u201d development area. (Provided by the City of Yorkville)\n\nFor the development plans to reach the next step, the committee must first approve an amendment to the site\u2019s current development plans that were first established back in the mid-2000\u2019s. The committee must also approve the plan layout designs and grant a special use variance for Costco\u2019s proposed gas fueling facility.\n\nThe plan layout stretches across 43.54 acres, encompassing the retail store, a gas fueling facility, perimeter lots, and lots designated for stormwater management. The members-only retail store would total 160,000 square-feet.\n\nCostco representatives are seeking special use authorization for a free-standing fueling facility that will house 16 gas dispensers, accommodating two cars per dispenser. The lot will allow a total maximum of 72 cars at the site. The current plans do not contain a convenience store alongside the fueling facility.\n\nCostco is also seeking allowance for 980 parking stalls. The current city code for the area only permits a maximum of 387 parking stalls.\n\nAlderman Arden Joe Plocher previously said that Costco representatives first reached out to the city more than two years ago. He said the total planning before construction could take up to six months.\n\nThe current property owner of the site is Joda Land Holding, LLC.\n\nFinal approval for the planned development is also contingent on the results of a traffic study already conducted by the city engineer. The city is awaiting feedback from the Illinois Department of Transportation on the results of the study. The city engineer recommends consideration of a traffic signal at the intersection of Veterans Parkway and Countryside Parkway and the entrance to the possible Costco parking area.",

Rather than sit on its lead against chief rivals Sam\u2019s Club and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Costco aims to aggressively expand its footprint in the U.S. and internationally \u2014 and much of Wall Street has given the stock its blessing.\n\nRead Next: Walmart Will Raise Prices in Response to Trump\u2019s Tariffs \u2014 Could Target and Costco Follow?\n\nCheck Out: Costco, Walmart and Other Stores With Perks Retirees Need To Be Taking Advantage Of\n\nSo with Costco continuing to grow its business, is it a good time to buy the stock?\n\nCostco Is Growing\n\nIn September, Costco announced plans to open 29 locations during the 2025 fiscal year, including 26 brand-new warehouses and three relocations of existing warehouses. A dozen of the new locations will be in global markets. That follows the 30 locations Costco opened in fiscal 2024, which ended on Sept. 1.\n\nThe new stores will add to what is already a big operation. As of early December, Costco operated a total of 897 warehouses. The vast majority \u2014 617 \u2014 are in the United States and Puerto Rico. But Costco also has 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 19 in South Korea, 15 in Australia and 14 in Taiwan. The rest are scattered among China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden. Costco also operates e-commerce sites on four continents.\n\nTry This: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\n\nStrong Financials\n\nWhile aggressive expansion plans sometimes make investors nervous, that\u2019s clearly not the case with Costco. Its stock price traded at a 52-week high of $1,008 in mid-December. Though shares have since fallen back to around $910, they\u2019re still up by about 41% over the past year. Many analysts rate the stock a \u201cBuy\u201d \u2014 a sign that they expect it to keep pushing higher. This usually means it\u2019s a good time to buy the stock.\n\nOne of Costco\u2019s main advantages is it\u2019s the biggest dog in what is essentially a three-dog race \u2014 with very high barriers to entry. Costco had a 62% share of the U.S. warehouse club market as of 2022, according to CFRA Research data cited by Produce Blue Book. Walmart-owned Sam\u2019s Club was next at 31%, followed by BJ\u2019s at 7%.\n\nCostco has also endeared itself to Wall Street with its winner-take-all expansion mentality and strong financials. The company reported a 3.4% gain in U.S. comparable sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 1, helped by a strong Black Friday performance. Comparable sales in Canada rose 3.7%, while those in other international markets climbed 1.3%.\n\nSuch robust organic sales growth is not an easy thing to pull off for a company as big as Costco, which logged about $250 billion in fiscal 2024 net sales. But Costco keeps beating the odds because it does so many things well, analysts say.\n\n\u201cCostco\u2019s resilient business model, centered around a membership-based structure, continues to be a major growth driver,\u201d Zacks noted in a Dec. 5 report. \u201cThe company\u2019s high membership renewal rates, coupled with its efficient supply chain management and bulk purchasing power, ensure competitive pricing and customer loyalty.\u201d\n\nMembership fees are an important part of Costco\u2019s story because they generate more than half of its profits. In 2024, the company announced that it would hike its fees for the first time in seven years. Gold Star and Business membership fees were both bumped to $65 a year from $60 previously, while Executive Membership fees rose to $130 from $120 a year.\n\nAnalysts will keep a close watch on how the raised fees impact Costco\u2019s financial results, if at all. They\u2019ll also keep an eye on the company\u2019s e-commerce business, which has lately been a drag on overall results.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Costco Keeps Growing Its Business \u2014 Is It Time To Buy the Stock?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Anything less and you'll end up with a mega-sized bag of open caramels in the pantry that no one wants to dip their hand into. To avoid all that risky business, we taste tested a selection of Costco candies to figure out which ones deserve to be selected over others. The worst option in our list of 10 Costco candies you haven't tried yet, ranked? The dark chocolate and sea salt cookie bark made by iconic cookie brand Tate's Bake Shop. This lesser-known Costco candy offering was crisp and full of texture but the personality of the cookie was masked by the strength of the chocolate coating.\n\nWhile there are some of us who simply can't get enough chocolate, we reckon Tate's cookie bark is simply overpowered by the intense flavor of the dark chocolate that's set on top of the jumbled pieces. And call us pernickety but we think that the biscuit-y character of a product labeled as a cookie should be pronounced. Inconsistently-sized, with some chunks drizzled in chocolate where as others were fully coated, the bark was appetizing but nothing to write home about. Plus the random variation in the way the bark was broken up seemed ill-considered. In fact, we're guessing the brand may have created this product as an inventive way to use up broken cookies.",

These individually wrapped sweet caramel candies, made with vanilla butter caramel and Celtic sea salt, come in a 17.1-ounce bag (with about 42 pieces) and are handmade in Montana. The label offers them up as \u201ca buttery one-of-a-kind experience you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d As if we needed another selling point, they're also touted as a nine-time national award-winning gourmet caramel.\n\nA recent thread on the /Costco Reddit forum confirms, \u201cThese are the best caramels,\u201d you won\u2019t be able to stop buying them once you start. The original poster explains they thought they might be good but didn\u2019t expect them to be \u201con another level.\u201d\n\nOthers described how they \"cannot stop eating these until they are gone,\u201d while someone else added that they have already \u201cpurchased 10 bags.\u201d A few have even warned that they are \u201ccareful about how often we buy them\u201d because they were \u201cstuffing like 10 of those bad boys in my face a day.\u201d\n\nOne particular comment included a pro tip to turn the store-bought caramels into homemade tasting decadence: \"Put them on a cooling rack, pour melted chocolate over them...Say you made them.\" Bring the candies to a party or as a host gift for everyone to enjoy.\n\nAs for us, we're already planning our next Costco shopping run solely to search for these. Since they are a seasonal item, they won\u2019t be around forever. Some shoppers have found that it also depends on the Costco location, as not every warehouse offers them. Luckily, you can always stick to ordering online\u2014as a Redditor pointed out, the candies are available on Costco.com if you can\u2019t find them in person. With so many saying how \u201camazing\u201d they are, we are equally eager to \u201ctry these now.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWith its recent rejection of a shareholder proposal that challenged its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Costco didn\u2019t actually break new ground. Even as anti-DEI campaigns have surged, most companies have held on to their diversity policies because they foster good decision-making and are conducive to their business goals.\n\nHowever, the statement from Costco\u2019s board of directors, urging shareholders to reject the proposal and combating some of its specifics, was notable in its forcefulness, experts say.\n\nIt was especially striking given high-profile moves last year by major companies, including retailers like Tractor Supply and Walmart, to retreat from their DEI programs, according to Dave Marcotte, senior vice president at Kantar Retail.\n\n\u201cOverall this provides a media narrative of conservatives winning over progressives which was a big theme for 2024. Costco has run directly contrary to that narrative,\u201d he said by email. \u201cAnd its formal response to an investor tactic (\u2018DEI raises stockholder risk\u2019), is a statement that [not only] refutes the premise but also states that these investors are not doing so in the interest of Costco but a larger political agenda. As the 5th largest retailer in the world, this is a loud statement.\u201d\n\n\"As the 5th largest retailer in the world, this is a loud statement.\u201d Dave Marcotte Senior Vice President, Kantar Retail\n\nIt came last month, within Costco\u2019s 2024 proxy statement, in response to the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank and Costco shareholder. The group had submitted a proposal to be considered for the company\u2019s annual meeting, requesting \u201cthat the Board conduct an evaluation and publish a report, omitting proprietary and privileged information, on the risks of the Company maintaining its current DEI (including \u2018People & Communities\u2019) roles, policies and goals.\u201d\n\nNCPPR cited recent lawsuits challenging DEI at companies; the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s rollback of affirmative action in college admissions; and the fact that several companies have retreated from their DEI efforts. \u201cIt's clear that DEI holds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the Company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders,\u201d the organization stated.\n\nBut Costco\u2019s board of directors unanimously recommended a vote against this. The board expressed confidence in the company\u2019s adherence to the law and thereby rejected any worry about litigation, and defended its diversity policies as good for its relationships with customers, suppliers and employees. The latter in turn has rewarded its shareholders, Costco also said.\n\nMoreover, the board didn\u2019t end with a defensive posture. It went on to argue that NCPPR is concerned less about Costco\u2019s business or shareholders and more about its own political agenda, namely, the \u201cabolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d Costco also corrected the record on some NCPPR claims, calling them \u201cmisleading, at best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs,\u201d the board wrote.\n\nWhile vigorous and direct, Costco\u2019s response was also careful and specific, according to Alison Taylor, professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of \u201cHigher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World.\u201d Some DEI critics have seized on inconclusive research regarding whether strong DEI efforts accrue to the bottom line, but Costco avoided making profitability claims and stuck to other valid business reasons, she said by phone.\n\n\u201cIt is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to longstanding diversity programs.\" Costco Board of Directors 2024 Proxy Statement\n\n\u201cThere are very mixed studies on the business case for diversity, but they're not getting into those business case arguments particularly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made the case around their culture and their values and what their customers want, and that I think was very defensible.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s move comes as many companies are hearing from both their legal and marketing departments that defending DEI policies could be costly, according to Taylor. But ditching DEI may not be as wise a response as it seems, and the future is uncertain. For example, if the incoming Trump administration further emboldens anti-DEI proponents, that could provoke a backlash, especially as Gen Z increasingly enters the workforce, she said.\n\n\u201cI think there's this kind of misunderstanding, that in some way kowtowing to Starbuck and these people reduces your risk,\u201d she said, referencing Robby Starbuck, a conservative provocateur who has taken credit for many recent DEI rollbacks. \u201cThat is not certain \u2014 there\u2019s no neat way to get rid of your risk here.\u201d\n\nHow might this play out in 2025?\n\nIn a way, this \u201cclear brand statement from Costco\u201d is par for the course for the retailer, according to Marcotte. The company has a long track record of sticking to what it sees as keys to its success, including among the best pay and other working conditions in the industry, despite grumbling from shareholders, he said.\n\n\u201cDEI in this context is the same, in that they see it as part of a successful model and, in character, react bluntly to being told what to do,\u201d he said, adding that the company\u2019s protection of its DEI policy is unlikely to dent its strong membership retention or domestic and international growth.\n\nIt may impress other companies, if only to influence them \u201cto simply ignore the anti-DEI as one more political movement,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much reporting about this, everyone\u2019s just kind of toeing the line, and there\u2019s nothing to be done. So I think this does kind of freshen up the debate.\" Alison Taylor Author, \u201cHigher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Costco has provided a road map for navigating the DEI controversy that doesn\u2019t only lead to capitulation, according to Taylor.\n\n\u201cIt kind of resets the conversation in some way. There's been so much reporting about this, everyone's just kind of toeing the line, and there's nothing to be done. So I think this does kind of freshen up the debate,\u201d she said. \u201cOther companies may follow through because Costco gives them a bit of top cover. Whoever goes first takes the flak, right? So I think it kind of gives a license and opens up a space to say that there's a different way to handle this.\u201d",

Plans call for replacing those properties with a 184,000-square-foot Costco Wholesale, along with 423 parking spaces at ground level and 390 on a rooftop parking deck. The store would be the 22nd Costco location in New Jersey and the third in Bergen County.\n\nThe mall is next to a residential area, and about a dozen people showed up Thursday to ask questions about the potential impacts, including a fence that would be built along adjacent homes. The hearing is scheduled to continue next month.\n\nRoute 17 Costco seeks several variances\n\nCostco is seeking about a dozen variances to deviate from local zoning regulations, including those concerning the amount of land covered, planted areas, its side- and rear-yard setbacks and the height of the fence.\n\nNew parking would include 33 spots with electric vehicle charging stations on the ground level, and the site would get additional improvements such as landscaping, lighting and a stormwater management system, Mazawey said.\n\nShe said there will be some changes to the plan in the future that will be ready by the project\u2019s next hearing.\n\nThe hearing included testimony from Costco's project engineer, Michelle Carlson, who discussed lighting, buffer zones and stormwater management. An existing chain-link, 6-foot-tall fence separates the property from the nearby residential neighborhood; the project would replace it with an 8-foot-tall, black vinyl chain-link fence, Carlson said.\n\nThe property previously had no stormwater management system, but Costco would add four basins to the site.\n\nMore: 'We Are the World,' Jersey-style: Local artists rerecord holiday classic to help Paramus nonprofit\n\nCostco also is asking for a lighting variance to put 34 cutoff lighting poles at ground level that would be 36\u00bd feet tall. If the project were to use shorter, 20-foot lighting poles to conform with existing zoning, there would be 64 poles instead of 34, said Carlson. Cutoff lighting poles emit light downward and don't let as much illumination leak upward, reducing light pollution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better and more even light when the poles are higher,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nDuring the meeting, residents asked about the buffer between the property and the surrounding houses. There is an elevated slope between the homes and the proposed parking lot, and Mazawey said the applicant will look into the possibility of placing the fence higher on the slope to be closer to the Costco building.\n\nThe application will be heard again on Feb. 20 at Paramus Borough Hall.\n\nCostco gas station a key issue\n\nParamus Mayor Chris DiPiazza, who also sits on the Planning Board, welcomed the proposal when it was announced in August, noting that it would revitalize a vacant property with a similar business. Importantly, he said at the time, the application does not include any Costco gas stations.\n\n\"That's important because of traffic concerns,\" DiPiazza said last year.\n\nStop & Shop closed the Route 17 store in January 2022, after what the supermarket chain called a \"difficult\" review of the operating performance of its location.\n\nStephanie Noda is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.

Now, the first signs of what eventually will be a 156,438-square-foot Costco Wholesale store are beginning to take shape on 49 acres on Kanner Highway, just south of Martin County High School.\n\nEarlier this month, workers in lime green vests and hard hats were elevated on construction lifts, building the warehouse\u2019s metal, skeletal frame.\n\nThe parking lot appears be fully paved, and the road bisecting the property is about halfway done.\n\nThe long-debated, much-anticipted Costco store is the centerpiece of M&M Realty\u2019s development between Kanner Highway and Willoughby Boulevard.\n\nThe development also will include at least two restaurants, an 18-pump Costco gas station, 1,725 parking spaces and 378 apartment units. The apartment complex will be gated and will include a 10,000-square-foot clubhouse.\n\nM&M Realty declined to release estimated cost of the development.\n\nThe Costco store will be the Treasure Coast\u2019s first; the next-nearest location is about 30 miles south in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nMore: Here's what to know about Costco coming to the Treasure Coast\n\nMore: Development 2025: What Treasure Coast projects are you likely to see come to reality in 2025?\n\nCostco has a polarizing history on the Treasure Coast.\n\nThe Stuart location was not the first attempt to build a Costco in Martin County. There was a plan for a store in Palm City, near both Interstate 95 and Florida's Turnpike, which was withdrawn in 2017 following more than three years of scrutiny from the public and county.\n\nWhen the Palm City plan fell through, Port St. Lucie Mayor Greg Oravec made an unsuccessful pitch on YouTube in an attempt to reel Costco to St. Lucie County.\n\nEventually, it was unanimously approved by the Stuart City Commission Aug. 9, 2021, but it was held up for nearly two years by legal challenges filed by Stuart resident Robin Cartwright, which were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nStill, Costco's buying-in-bulk business model commands widespread enthusiasm among consumers. The Costco food court, popularized by viral sensation Costco Guys, is lauded as an integral part of the Costco shopping experience.\n\nAt the same time Costco's Stuart store is under construction, the company is building a distribution depot on nearly 200 acres just off Interstate 95 in Port St. Lucie\u2019s Southern Grove district.\n\nJack Randall is TCPalm\u2019s economy and real estate reporter.

Harvard that determined affirmative action programs for college admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nNCPPR also noted that the Supreme Court decision has prompted DEI-related lawsuits, including the lawsuit against Starbucks Corp. for firing regional director Shannon Phillips, who claimed she was fired for being white. That lawsuit resulted in a $25.6 million verdict for Phillips, who called the police on two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks in 2018, which sparked protests against the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI holds litigation, reputational, and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders,\u201d the NCPPR letter to Costco stated, noting that other companies such as Alphabet, Meta, Zoom, and John Deere have scaled back or eliminated their DEI programs.\n\nSimilarly, Walmart recently reversed course on DEI and LGBTQ initiatives, which includes cutting funding to the Center for Racial Equity, which was established after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nThe Costco Board of Directors said in its letter to shareholders that the requested report \u201cwould not provide meaningful additional information to our shareholders, and the Board thus unanimously recommends a vote against this proposal.\u201d\n\nCostco said it regularly evaluates its practices to comply with the law \u201cincluding evolving Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the company but abolition of diversity initiatives,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cA 2023 federal district court decision, in a case brought by (NCPPR), noted that the proponent had \u2018published a document called \u2018Balancing the Boardroom 2022,\u2019 which describes its shareholder activism as \u2018fighting back\u2019 against \u2018the evils of woke politicized capital and companies.\u2019\u201d",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), as well as a micro-cap stock Smith-Midland Corp. (SMID). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Shares of UnitedHealth have declined -6.1% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry\u2019s decline of -9.9%. The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $29.50-$30.00 band in 2025. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. (You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+41.1% vs. +25.1%). The company Being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+41.6% vs. +10.9%). The company is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. Settlement of ongoing lawsuits with GlobalFoundries will pave the way for future collaboration and exploration of new revenue-generating opportunities. IBM is collaborating with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry. The collaboration is likely to facilitate higher productivity and help accelerate business transformation in consumer-packaged goods and retail firms. However, stiff competition in various end markets is straining profits. Stringent cost-cutting efforts to boost margins beyond a certain threshold are likely to impact product quality. Although the company generates significant cash flow, a high debt level can hinder its ability to sustain dividend payout and impact growth initiatives. (You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> ) Smith-Midland\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry over the past year (+68.6% vs. +0.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $233.51 million has demonstrated record revenue growth, driven by increased production volumes across its plants, especially for infrastructure-related projects. In the second quarter of 2024, revenues surged 34% year over year to $19.6 million, with a strong $59.2 million backlog supporting continued expansion. The utility segment also showed robust growth, particularly in the Northern Virginia market. The company is strategically positioned with key infrastructure contracts and a solid financial footing, including $7.3 million in cash and a low debt-to-capitalization ratio. However, concerns include revenue concentration, fluctuating demand in key product lines, exposure to inflation, operational risks and seasonal variability. Rising accounts receivable and the suspension of dividends could strain the company\u2019s cash flow and impact investor sentiment.

            "content": "Corporate board members who are interested in maintaining diversity equity and inclusion programs at their companies will want to pay attention to what the Costco board is doing in its fight against anti-DEI activists.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) has filed a proposal which asks Costco to end its DEI initiatives because they are discriminatory and open the company up to financial and legal risks. In a statement, the conservative think tank stated that, \u201cDEI holds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d The NCPPR asks shareholders to vote in support of its proposal during Costco\u2019s annual meeting set for January 23.\n\nCostco\u2019s board is urging shareholders to vote against the NCPPR proposal and has publicly stated its commitment to its DEI programs. In a message to its investors, the board stated \u201cOur efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics: For our employees, these efforts are built around inclusion\u2014having all of our employees feel valued and respected. Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.\u201d\n\nThe January 23 vote will help determine whether Costco will join Walmart, Harley Davidson, Ford Motor Company, Tractor Supply, John Deere, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Microsoft and Southwest Airlines and several other major companies that have taken a stance against DEI initiatives, in part due to pressure from conservative groups. In 2024, some companies were threatened with legal actions and boycotts because of their support for DEI initiatives. There are reports that Costco might be facing a boycott soon.\n\nNo matter which side of the DEI debate directors are on, corporate boards will likely pay close attention to what happens with the vote on this anti-DEI proposal. Costco is one of the largest companies to be confronted with calls to dismantle its DEI programs, and its board has chosen to fight. Examining what Costco does may prove helpful as the debate over DEI continues. Corporate boards might want to:\n\nCommunicate the organization\u2019s commitment to diversity to investors. In a message to investors, Costco\u2019s board explained its reasoning for believing in and implementing diversity programs. The board also explained how diversity contributed to and enhanced the current business, which is very profitable and well admired across the globe. It made the point that employees were largely in favor of the programs and that the programs helped with recruiting the best and brightest from all backgrounds. Other boards might want to show that with diversity programs in place, their businesses haven\u2019t suffered the negative impacts the anti-DEI activists suggest.\n\nConnect DEI with corporate values. Soon after the NCPPR proposal was filed, Costco quickly reached out to investors in a message tying diversity to the company\u2019s code of ethics. Establishing the organization as ethical will help dissuade the attempts to smear it as discriminatory. Also demonstrating that the company has a corporate culture that fosters tolerance and values differences might go a long way to fending off claims of discriminatory behavior.\n\nPrepare a legal defense of your DEI programs. Ultimately, anti-DEI activists will likely file lawsuits if shareholders do not vote to abolish DEI programs. Boards will need to make sure that any programs they implement are not viewed as quotas and do not discriminate against people who are white, Asian male or straight. It might be wise to approach outside legal consultants because the language used to describe and defend any DEI program will be under the strictest scrutiny imaginable.\n\nPrint Article",

One of those is shopping at Costco to keep my home stocked with the foods and household supplies we use every single day. I\u2019ve had a warehouse membership for more than a decade and it has been well worth the cost through every stage and season of life.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve curated my own list of favorite Costco buys, many of which I share here at The Kitchn every month. If you want a sneak peek into what\u2019s in my cart, all you have to do is check out my list of the best Costco groceries. This month, I\u2019m sharing a long-overlooked grocery item that\u2019s become essential to the way I started to cook in the last year. That item is Kirkland Signature Cage-Free Egg Whites.\n\nCredit: Patty Catalano Credit: Patty Catalano\n\nWhat\u2019s So Great About Kirkland Signature Cage-Free Egg Whites?\n\nI always have whole eggs in my refrigerator, so for a long time I resisted buying the bulk-sized box of egg whites. Then I started paying attention to how often I would crack open an egg and discard the yolks when looking for a protein boost. I didn\u2019t like the waste, so I found these cartons of egg whites to be the perfect compromise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostco sells the liquid egg whites in a box of six 16-ounce cartons. Each carton contains the equivalent of 10 eggs. To buy just one 16-ounce carton of cage-free liquid egg whites at my local Tampa-area grocery store, I\u2019d spend $7, while at Costco, six cartons cost just $10. That\u2019s like getting 8 1/2 cartons for free.\n\nCostco\u2019s Kirkland Signature egg whites have just one ingredient \u2014 liquid egg whites \u2014 and no additives or preservatives. When shopping for this item, check the different pallets for the latest expiration date available to give yourself the most time to use the egg whites. Unopened cartons of egg whites can be frozen for 30 days; just remember to thaw them overnight in the refrigerator before using.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Way to Enjoy Kirkland Signature Cage-Free Egg Whites?\n\nIf using such a large quantity of egg whites feels overwhelming, here are some ideas to get you started. I add a few tablespoons of egg whites to whole eggs when making scrambled eggs to add extra protein. You can also use them to make egg-white omelets or copycat Starbuck\u2019s egg bites. A bowl of yogurt topped with big clusters of homemade granola is one of my favorite ways to start the day. The secret to getting those big chunks of oats, nuts, and seeds is to add an egg white.\n\nKirkland Signature\u2019s egg whites are pasteurized, or heated at a temperature for a long enough time to kill pathogens, like Salmonella, without cooking the eggs. That means you can also eat these eggs uncooked. When would an uncooked egg be appropriate for a recipe? Many classic cocktails, including whiskey sours and Pisco sours, use egg whites to smooth the edges of the drink and add a frothy layer to the top. Pasteurized egg whites don\u2019t whip as easily as the whites from whole eggs, so they aren\u2019t a good candidate for meringue cookies or angel food cake, but you can absolutely use them for a snowy-white cake.\n\n\n\nBuy: Kirkland Signature Cage-Free Egg Whites, $10.69 for 6 (16-ounce) cartons\n\n\n\nWhat Costco staples are you buying this January?

On social media, dozens of people are coming forward to share frightening stories of bad bakery behavior from fellow customers.\n\nIt all began when a user on Reddit shared the disturbing tale of witnessing a couple opening various containers of croissants and swapping out the croissants with their bare hands to get \"the optimal purchase.\"\n\n\"Never seen something so nasty in my life. And yes they were not wearing gloves or using protective tongs or anything,\" they wrote.\n\nThroughout the comments section, users questioned if workers were alerted to the sketchy croissant-swapping and also wondered why packages aren't sealed with a sticker. Others suggested that customers should have their Costco memberships revoked for such actions.\n\n\"I think people should get their memberships revoked for messing with the food, abusing the return policy or leaving food around when they decide they don\u2019t want it,\" one person wrote.\n\nRelated Story What Costco Shoppers Want To Change\n\n\"I would happily volunteer my time to go through footage and contact these people to revoke their memberships,\" another user added. Another had a simple solution: \"Mandatory jail time.\"\n\nAnd it isn't just the Costco bakery that's prone to bad behavior from customers. Other Reddit users chimed in with their own gross-out shopping experiences.\n\n\"I went with my kids yesterday and we saw 6 (SIX!!!) instances where people left refrigerated items around the store. 1 of the 6 were opened food,\" one person pointed out.\n\n\"What would be the penalty for diagonal cart parking in the middle 0f the aisle?\" another user asked.\n\n\"I saw some lady open all the rotisserie bags so she could get a better look and then just leaving them on the display unzipped,\" shared yet another unfortunate shopper.\n\nYet another refreshed our memories about a cultural low point: \"Reminds me of how it became a viral thing for people to open ice cream containers in stores and lick them. And it became pervasive enough that more and more ice cream retailers are wrapping the lid with plastic now.\"\n\nHave you witnessed any ban-worthy shopping behavior at your local Costco\u2014or elsewhere?",

Here\u2019s what we know at this point.\n\nNutthaseth Vanchaichana/istockphoto\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening to Costco\u2019s Soda Fountain?\n\nAccording to Costco Insider and an anonymous source on the Costco Reddit forum, the soda fountains in Costco\u2019s cafes are going to switch from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola products. That means you\u2019ll have drinks like Coke, Diet Coke, and Sprite to choose from instead of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Starry. Though there\u2019s no exact date reported for the switch, \u201cearly 2025\u201d is the timeframe for the change.\n\nFlickr\n\nDidn\u2019t Costco Cafes Have Coke Products Before?\n\nYep! You\u2019re not crazy if you remember getting Coke in the Costco food court before. If you shopped there before 2013, you had Coca-Cola products to choose from. The store switched to Pepsi after Coke refused to give Costco as good a deal as the company supposedly gave Walmart. And for about a month, Costco stopped carrying ANY Coke products, not just in the food court.\n\nCheapism\n\nHas Costco Confirmed Anything?\n\nNo, Costco has not confirmed the switch from Pepsi to Coke. So while it sounds like it could be true (and rumors similar to these pop up all the time and are sometimes true), we just don\u2019t know.\n\nwellesenterprises/istockphoto\n\nHow Do People Feel About the Switch to Coke?\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of love lost for Pepsi, honestly.

There\u2019s also a large contingent of people who want Dr Pepper, though that\u2019s unlikely given it\u2019s not owned by Coca-Cola.\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of people that don\u2019t really care, of course. \u201cI could deal with it if they were kept calibrated,\u201d said u/FalconFrenulum. \u201cEvery time I go it\u2019s too syrupy or light to the point it tastes like water.\u201d\n\nFor more Costco stories, sign up for our free newsletters.\n\nThis article was originally published on Cheapism\n\nCheapism\n\nMore From Cheapism",

Costco also outperformed the market in 2023 \u2014 logging a 44% increase. The membership-only retailer gained market share last year along with heavyweights like Walmart and Amazon by excelling in both consumer staples and discretionary categories. Driving success was a sharp focus on delivering value and newness, which kept customer traffic strong and membership counts climbing. Costco's private label, Kirkland Signature, grew faster than national brands, solidifying its reputation for quality at favorable prices. The retailer also made strides online, with e-commerce traffic growing steadily and digital tools like the Costco app, now downloaded 42 million times, enhancing the customer experience. '25 look ahead Costco heads into 2025 with several promising growth drivers. Aside from its traditional approach to growing headline earnings and sales, the company is expanding its alternative revenue streams, particularly through its budding retail media business. The goal here is to capture advertising dollars from brands eager to tap into Costco's loyal customer base. E-commerce and logistics are two other growth areas. The recent membership fee increase, which went into effect in September, is another potential catalyst since it should drive fee income higher in the quarters ahead. Costco likes to reinvest those additional dollars back into the business to keep prices low, which adds to its appeal as a place to shop. A risk to watch, though, is whether Costco's membership renewal rates decline \u2014 whether that's because some members bail due to higher pricing or people who initially signed up online decide to cancel. Executives have flagged that members acquired digitally tend to renew at lower rates, and some pressure from that dynamic is already afoot. To be sure, Costco ended its most recent quarter with 77.4 million paid members, up 7.6% from the year-ago period. Renewal rates can have an impact on Costco's margins and expansion plans, especially since new store openings are closely tied to the success of existing locations. On the expansion front, Costco plans to open more stores globally, with over half of the new locations in the U.S., reflecting confidence in the ability to add more scale in its home market. \"They could use, I don't know, maybe triple the number of Costcos there are right now around the globe? Maybe more?\" Jim Cramer suggested on the Club's December Monthly Meeting. \"The runway for this company is longer than any other we own. I think there's nothing like going to Costco for price, for quality and that's what you are paying that high [stock] multiple for.

We\u2019ve been using them for years, and they\u2019re honestly one of the best deals you can find.\n\nWe first purchased the Berkshire Life Heated Throw years ago, and after quickly realizing we\u2019d play tug-of-war over one, we steadily added a few more to our collection.

Cables run through the length of the fuzzy blanket, bringing a toasty feeling from head to toe. The power cord is extra long, so you\u2019re not tied to the room\u2019s outlet placement. Even better, the heat has a built-in shutoff after four hours. As someone who\u2019s fallen asleep under these blankets several times, it\u2019s a crucial feature to prevent overheating.\n\nEvery holiday season, when I go home to visit my family, it means movie nights snuggled under these blankets. It\u2019s not uncommon in my household to have a lighthearted argument over who gets to use the \"fancy\" blanket. I loved using it so much that I got one of my own for my apartment. After a long day and a cold commute, it's the first thing I reach for when I get home.\n\nI can\u2019t recommend it enough, either as a family Christmas gift or as a treat for yourself. At $35, the price is unbeatable. But I love a challenge and I found some pretty affordable alternatives, just in case you can\u2019t find the heated blanket at your local Costco. I rounded up a few more options you can order online so that you can have a heated blanket delivered right to your doorstep in just days.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram and .",

            "content": "It has long been clear that relying on corporate leaders to stand fast for social and economic progress is a mug\u2019s game.\n\nBig business talks the talk, of course. As I\u2019ve written before, after the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, many corporate leaders pledged publicly to oppose the assaults from the political right wing on democracy.\n\nLeading corporations said they would cease making campaign contributions to lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden\u2019s election or played a role in the insurrection in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. \u2014 Costco responds to anti-DEI agitators\n\nSome made similar promises about state laws restricting abortion or voting rights, or talked openly about reducing their activities in states enacting such measures. They promoted their commitment to programs fostering diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, however, most of these companies folded like a poker player with a bad hand. That\u2019s been especially evident on DEI, which became a target in the \u201canti-woke campaign\u201d waged by right-wing culture warriors such as Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis during the late presidential campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-DEI activism on the right gathered steam after the Supreme Court struck down college affirmative action admission policies in June 2023.\n\nThroughout this year, big corporations have retreated from the DEI landscape. The largest to do so is Walmart. In November, the company said it wouldn\u2019t renew the five-year, $100-million commitment it made in establishing its Center for Racial Equity in the wake of the George Floyd killing, would cease using the term DEI and would end other diversity initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\u201d the company said.\n\nFord, Harley-Davidson, Lowe\u2019s and other companies said they would no longer provide workplace data to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, in part because the campaign\u2019s widely published index of corporate progress enabled anti-LGBTQ+ activists to mount a backlash against participating companies.\n\nThat brings us to Costco Wholesale. Almost uniquely among major public companies, Costco\u2019s board has explicitly rejected the anti-DEI backlash.\n\nThe response from Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco came in the Dec. 11 proxy statement for its annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23. The meeting agenda includes a shareholder resolution proposed by the right-wing National Center for Public Policy Research, insinuating that Costco\u2019s DEI program \u201cholds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the Company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe resolution calls on the board to report on \u201cthe risks of the Company maintaining its current DEI ... roles, policies and goals.\u201d\n\nThe Costco board unanimously advised shareholders to vote against the resolution. \u201cOur commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\u201d it said in its response. \u201cOur efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe board took direct aim at the center, the resolution proponent, which it accused of hiding its true goal. Although the center \u201cprofesses concern about legal and financial risks to the Company and its shareholders associated with the diversity initiatives,\u201d the board stated, \u201cit is the proponent and others that are responsible for inflicting burdens on companies with their challenges to long-standing diversity programs. The proponent\u2019s broader agenda is not reducing risk for the Company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d\n\nThat swipe seems to have hit home. \u201cThe recent wave of companies walking back their DEI in response to no greater threat than merely having the truth about their DEI programs exposed,\u201d center staff member Stefan Padfield told me by email, \u201cmakes clear that any related burden[s] these companies are experiencing are of their own making as they seek to misuse shareholders\u2019 money to advance neo-Marxist and neo-racist \u2018equity\u2019 agendas.\u201d\n\nCostco says it doesn\u2019t have any comment about the shareholder resolution beyond the board statement.\n\nAlthough the Costco board didn\u2019t go into detail, the center has assembled quite a record as a culture warrior. It\u2019s a \u201cpartner\u201d of the Stop Corporate Tyranny coalition, which describes itself as \u201ca one-stop shop for educational resources exposing the Left\u2019s nearly completed takeover of corporate America.\u201d It has opposed initiatives to combat global warming, asserting that global warming isn\u2019t happening, and it promotes cryptocurrency.\n\nVoices Hiltzik: Right-wing hatemongers count on the cowardice of companies such as Target When anti-LGBTQ+ activists went after Target for selling Pride merchandise, they guessed the company would cave. They were right.\n\nCostco\u2019s straightforward response to the center\u2019s proposed resolution may not be that much of a surprise. The company is generally known as employee-friendly, with favorable ratings from workers posting on Glassdoor. Among its benefits, health coverage with low co-pays is available to workers employed for at least 23 hours a week for 180 days.\n\nIts approach to union organizing activity may not be entirely welcoming, but seems to lack the truculence and hostility shown by retailers such as Starbucks and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf Costco\u2019s roughly 219,000 employees, about 18,000 are represented by the Teamsters. Remarkably, when 238 Costco workers in Norfolk, Va., voted to affiliate with the Teamsters a year ago, Chief Executive Ron Vachris and his immediate predecessor, W. Craig Jelinek, issued a joint statement blaming themselves.\n\nThey said they were \u201cnot disappointed in our employees; we\u2019re disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders. ...The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part,\u201d they wrote in a memo dated Dec. 29 and sent to all U.S. employees. CNN obtained a copy of the memo.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that labor relations are free of conflict: Early in December, the Teamsters union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Costco for what it called the company\u2019s \u201ccalculated effort to undermine workers\u2019 rights and disrupt the collective bargaining process.\u201d\n\nAsserting that the company\u2019s worker-friendly reputation is undeserved, the Teamsters said Costco had \u201cexpelled union representatives from stores, harassed and intimidated workers for wearing Teamsters buttons and attire, sent employees home, and even changed locks on union bulletin boards\u201d to prevent the union from disseminating information to workers. Costco said it has no comment on the charges.\n\nA few words about shareholder resolutions are appropriate here. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on college affirmative action, the number of resolutions about DEI programs receiving a vote at corporate annual meetings rose appreciably, to 25 through May this year from 13 in 2023, according to the Conference Board.\n\nTo be fair, that\u2019s still a small number among the roughly 3,000 public companies in the Russell 300 index. More notable, however, is that anti-DEI proposals remained deeply unpopular. Resolutions opposing workplace diversity programs garnered support from less than 2% of shareholders, on average; those favoring such programs received support from an average of 21% of shareholders (Shareholder resolutions proposed by almost anyone other than corporate managements seldom get anywhere near majority support.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Conference Board, a nonprofit corporate research consultancy, has found that diversity programs aimed at managers and the rank and file enhance corporate fortunes. Companies with diverse management teams \u201cdemonstrate 19% higher revenues due to innovation,\u201d the board says.\n\nThose with \u201chigher racial and ethnic diversity [are] 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry medians.\u201d Commitments to diversity appeal to job applicants and tend to improve productivity.\n\nOn the other side of the coin is what the center\u2019s Padfield claimed is \u201cthe wave of customer backlash we\u2019ve seen against DEI.\u201d He added, \u201crather than doing the right thing and evaluating the relevant risks ... Costco is apparently doubling down on divisive and value-destroying DEI.\u201d\n\nThe center told me by email that \u201cone day, Costco will no longer have a DEI program. We hope for the sake of shareholders that it\u2019s sooner rather than later.\u201d Shareholders, workers and customers may hope for their own sake that the opposite is true \u2014 and that other businesses follow Costco\u2019s example.",

After all, no one wants to show up only to find the doors of their favorite store are closed, especially if they've got guests showing up or need essentials like toilet paper or eggs.\n\nTo ensure that doesn't happen to you, see below to find out everything to know about Costco's New Year's hours.

Here are some of the biggest stories the Reporter-Telegram covered this year.\n\nFinally, a Costco\n\nIn its third attempt to bring a much-wanted big box-retailer, Midland has finally done it: Costco Wholesale is coming.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn August, the city of Midland and Midland Development Corp. announced its respective incentive packages to bring Costco to an undeveloped site on State Highway 191 \u2014 a location that previously was intended for Bass Pro Shops until the company decided to build down the road in Odessa, though still in Midland County.\n\nGround was broken in December, and a new tax increment reinvestment zone will be established to help fund several infrastructure projects in the area both above ground and below. It will be the largest Costco in Texas.\n\nPerhaps the best news of all: Costco is now slated to open in June 2025, about a year earlier than anticipated.\n\nWhole lotta shaking going on\n\nFive of the strongest earthquakes in Texas history were recorded in 2024, four of which happened in the Permian Basin, and three of which happened within a few days of each other.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nA 4.7-magnitude quake was recorded Feb. 17 in Karnes County, which is southeast of San Antonio.\n\nIn July, the Scurry-Fisher county line was the site for three large temblors. A 4.9-magnitude earthquake was recorded on the 23rd. On the 26th, a 5.1-magnitude shaker struck, followed by a 4.5 a day later.\n\nSept. 17 saw another earthquake greater than 5.0-magnitude: a 5.1 in Martin County.\n\nSome of these quakes have been attributed to saltwater injection wells, and the Railroad Commission has been taking action.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWild weather\n\nA severe thunderstorm rolled into Midland on May 30 and brought with it hail and tornadoes, including a twister rated EF-3 that touched down near Midland International Air and Space Port.\n\nWhile the storm caused damage throughout the western part of Midland County, it was perhaps felt most by National Weather Service meteorologists at MAF, who not only reported severe hail damage to their vehicles, but also to the building that houses its weather balloons. Their Doppler radar, which we rely on to see what\u2019s happening in the sky, was OK.\n\nFast forward to early September, and Midland saw a deluge of rain. NWS recorded its sixth-highest single-day rainfall total at the airport: 3.63 inches on Sept. 3.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMajor mergers usher in new eras\n\nSeveral big oil and gas mergers were finalized in 2024.\n\nExxonMobil got the green light for a $63 billion takeover Pioneer Natural Resources, the shale-drilling standout whose alumni launched many of their own companies, including Tim Dunn, whose CrownRock was purchased by Occidental for about $12 billion\n\nThen there was the $26 billion merger of Diamondback Energy and Endeavor Energy Resources, which was the largest private employer in Midland County and was led by legendary oilman Autry Stephens.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nStephens passed away Aug. 16 at the age of 86.\n\nCouncilman suddenly passes away\n\nPerhaps the biggest news in early 2024 was the untimely death of At-Large City Councilman Dan Corrales.\n\nA native Midlander, Corrales was elected to his City Council post in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOn Jan. 30, he was found dead in his home.

If you expect to earn more than $65 in store credit each year, that can help offset membership fees. You can use it to pay the difference when you renew, all while enjoying the perks of the Executive Membership without actually spending more. You might even come out ahead in the end.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the store credit from Executive Memberships comes as a check in the mail and needs to be redeemed in person.

            "content": "You don\u2019t have to be vegan to enjoy vegan food. In fact, many foods sold at popular grocery stores, such as Costco, just so happen to be vegan. The warehouse\u2019s frozen berry blend, maple syrup, and peanut butter are entirely made from plants, for example. However, the cost of vegan food generally gets a lot of criticism. Fresh produce and specialty vegan products are often more expensive than other groceries, so there\u2019s speculation that vegan consumers spend more on food.\n\nBut if you shop at Costco, you\u2019re practically guaranteed to save money on groceries. Costco can be a great place to shop for vegan food\u2014there\u2019s a lot of variety and buying in bulk helps you get the best deals. Here are the best Costco vegan products to check out if you want to eat more plants.\n\n\n\nImpossible Burger Patties\n\nVegan meats are usually more expensive than other protein sources, such as lentils or tofu. But sometimes you just want a hearty burger, and if you\u2019re vegan, a black bean burger won\u2019t always cut it. The Impossible Burger is arguably the best vegan burger, with its meaty taste and texture as well as 19 grams of protein per serving. The warehouse sells it in a 10-pack for under $1.90 per patty\u2014use what you need and freeze the rest for later for burgers, salads, meatballs, meat loaf, and so on.\n\nHouse Foods Organic Tofu\n\nSoy foods, like edamame and tofu, are some of the best protein sources for vegans. Tofu itself is pretty affordable, but organic tofu usually costs more. Fortunately, you can get a 4-pack of organic tofu from Costco, so each package of tofu comes in under $2. With a firm texture, this tofu will hold up in recipes for stir fries, lettuce wraps, soups, curries, and more. You can also air fry or grill it, making it super versatile.\n\nCalifia Farms, Cafe Oat Milk\n\nThere are many non-dairy milk options to choose from nowadays, but oat milk has risen to the top. It\u2019s creamier than almond milk, and suitable for people with allergies to soy. Costco carries a case of oat milk, which contains six shelf-stable cartons. It\u2019s a popular addition to coffee, especially if you have a milk frother to get it nice and foamy. You can also use oat milk in cereal, oatmeal, smoothies, and recipes for baked goods.\n\nAmy's Organic Soups\n\nCostco\u2019s pantry section has quite a few vegan options, such as canned beans, tomatoes, pasta, and pasta sauces. While those are fine and dandy, they require more effort to make a meal compared to this variety pack of soups. You get eight canned soups that are all organic, lower in sodium, and vegan, of course. You get two flavors per pack\u2014lentil and lentil vegetable\u2014which both provide plenty of protein and fiber. Just heat and eat these soups by themselves, or serve with some bread or salad on the side.\n\n\n\nUnreal Dark Chocolate Coconut Minis\n\nMost of Costco\u2019s desserts aren\u2019t vegan\u2014they usually contain milk, eggs, etc. However, you can get a bag of vegan-friendly candy from the brand Unreal. The treats are made with dark chocolate and have a coconut filling, so they\u2019re suitable for vegans and people with dairy allergies. They\u2019re also lower in sugar than other candies. Since each candy is individually wrapped, you can unwrap one or two at a time for a sweet treat after dinner.\n\nAjinomoto Yakisoba With Vegetables\n\nCostco has carried these stir-fried noodles for years, and they\u2019ve always been a hit. Noodles are often made with eggs, and stir fry sauces may contain fish sauce, but this product is actually vegan. You\u2019ll find it in the freezer aisle, and each case contains six packs of the noodle-vegetable dish. All you have to do is heat one up to enjoy as an entr\u00e9e or side dish.\n\nSkinny Pop Popcorn\n\nLow in calories, popcorn is a light and airy snack, and it\u2019s surprisingly high in fiber. You can pop your own popcorn, but for something easy to grab and go, snag a box of Skinny Pop Popcorn at Costco. You\u2019ll get 28 individually wrapped bags of popcorn, which comes out to about $0.60 per serving. What\u2019s more? Each bag contains just 100 calories and 2 grams of fiber. Pack these in your lunch box to munch on at work, or look forward to opening up a bag in the evening as you settle in with a movie.\n\nBeyond Meat Plant-Based Patties\n\nThe Impossible Burger isn\u2019t the only vegan burger sold at Costco. Some locations also carry the Beyond Burger, another plant-based meat alternative you can use in burgers, salads, and more. So, what\u2019s the difference? You get 10 frozen patties in each package, but the Beyond Burger is lower in saturated fat and slightly higher in protein, with 20 grams per serving. However, the Impossible Burger is more similar in taste and texture to beef burgers. The choice may come down to the nutrition facts, taste, texture, or availability.\n\n\n\nOrgain + Justin's Nut Butter Protein Powder\n\nVegan or not, it can be difficult to meet your protein goals each day. That\u2019s why protein powders are so convenient\u2014one serving usually provides 20 grams of protein. Whey protein isn\u2019t vegan friendly because it\u2019s derived from dairy, but you can order a tub of vegan protein powder from Costco. It\u2019s made with protein from powdered peas, peanuts, brown rice, and almonds instead of milk byproducts. Each tub has 20 servings that provide 20 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 150 calories. It\u2019s also high in iron. Toss a scoop in your smoothie or post-workout shake, or mix it with non-dairy milk.\n\nKirkland Signature Organic Blue Agave\n\nMaple syrup and agave are both sweeteners that make for suitable honey substitutes. Costco sells a 2-pack of organic agave, and since it\u2019s not a super common ingredient, you\u2019ll want to take advantage of the accessibility and affordability. You can use it similarly to how you\u2019d use honey\u2014drizzle it on smoothie bowls, oatmeal, and toast, or use it in beverages like tea, cocktails, and mocktails.",

The proposal argues that these initiatives are discriminatory and financially risky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that DEI holds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the Company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders,\u201d the conservative think tank said in its statement of support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe think tank argues that Costco is sticking to a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d DEI program, despite the broader trend of companies cutting back on such initiatives. They note that Costco recently rebranded its DEI program to \u201cPeople and Communities,\u201d but they believe this just a \u201cnew label\u201d for the same practices \u2014 including hiring and promoting based on race and sex, and selecting suppliers for similar reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Costco\u2019s Board of Directors is firmly against the proposal. They argue that their DEI efforts are not only good for business, but also reflect the company\u2019s core values of inclusion and respect.\n\nCostco insists that its DEI program helps attract and retain talented employees, fosters innovation, and strengthens relationships with customers and suppliers. Additionally, the company says that its DEI policies fully comply with the law, including recent Supreme Court rulings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a unanimous vote, the Board urges shareholders to reject the proposal. Shareholders will vote on it at the Annual Meeting on Jan. 23.\n\n\u201cWe welcome members from all walks of life,\u201d Costco\u2019s Board of Directors said. \u201cAs our membership diversifies, we believe that having a diverse team improves satisfaction. A diverse workforce brings creativity to our products, better understands customer preferences, and reflects the diverse backgrounds of the members we serve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s proposal cites the recent SFFA v. Harvard Supreme Court ruling, which struck down race-based admissions policies, suggesting it could jeopardize the legality of corporate DEI programs that factor in race and gender for hiring, promotions, and supplier selections. Since the ruling, several companies have faced lawsuits over their DEI practices, including Starbucks (SBUX-2.49% ), which was hit with a $25 million lawsuit for discriminating against a white employee.\n\nProponents of the Costco proposal warn that the company could be vulnerable to similar legal challenges, especially since its DEI program emphasizes \u201cequity\u201d and includes a Chief Diversity Officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of this proposal is notable. As DEI comes under increasing scrutiny across the corporate world, many large companies have started rolling back their commitments. Companies like Google (GOOGL-2.72% ), Meta (META-4.64% ), Microsoft, Walmart, and Zoom have all reduced their DEI staffing and/or programs. Companies including John Deere and Tractor Supply (TSCO-1.28% ) have publicly scaled back their DEI initiatives, saying they are reassessing their strategies.\n\nAs DEI policies face mounting scrutiny, this shareholder proposal is just the latest example of the ongoing going debate over the future of diversity programs in corporate America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShareholders will vote on whether to support the proposal at Costco\u2019s Annual Meeting. If it passes, Costco will be required to conduct the requested evaluation. However, if the Board\u2019s recommendation to vote against it prevails, the company will continue with its DEI policies as they are. The outcome could serve as a bellwether, signaling whether other companies will follow Costco\u2019s lead or continue the trend of scaling back their DEI commitments.",

Our expert take The Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi is a valuable card to pair with a Costco membership, but the rewards program is more restrictive than what you get with a typical cash-back card. Pros & cons High rewards rates for gas/EV charging and travel\n\nNo foreign transaction fees Restrictive rewards that you can only cash out once per year\n\nRequires a paid Costco membership\n\nNo welcome bonus More details Highlights Highlights shown here are provided by the issuer and have not been reviewed by CNBC Select's editorial staff.

However, the Costco Anywhere Visa requires a Costco membership which costs $65 to $130 a year. While the cost of a Costco membership may be worth it for you based on what you save at Costco compared to other stores, the membership fee eats into your credit card rewards. The Costco Anywhere Visa earns 2% cash back on all non-travel Costco and Costco.com purchases. At that rate, it takes $3,250 of non-travel Costco purchases each year to offset a $65 membership fee. Winner: Citi Double Cash Card\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nThe Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card has a welcome bonus of $200 cash back after spending $1,500 in the first six months of account opening. This bonus is fulfilled as 20,000 Citi ThankYou\u00ae Points, which provides additional redemption options beyond cash back. The Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi has no welcome bonus. Winner: Citi Double Cash Card\n\nRewards\n\nCiti Double Cash\u00ae Card and Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi rewards comparison Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi Gas and EV charging 2% cash back (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay) 5% cash back rewards on gas at Costco and earn 4% cash back on other eligible gas and electric vehicle (EV) charging purchases for the first $7,000 combined spend per year, and then 1% thereafter. Restaurants 2% cash back (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay) 3% cash back Travel 2% cash back (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay) 3% cash back (including Costco travel) Costco (In-store) N/A 2% cash back Costco.com 2% cash back (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay)* 2% cash back All other purchases 2% cash back (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay) 1% cash back\n\n\n\nThe Citi Double Cash is a flat-rate 2% cash-back credit card (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay). So it's simple and more rewarding for any purchase that falls outside of the Costco Visa's bonus spending categories. However, if you spend a lot on travel or gas/EV charging, the additional rewards you earn with the Costco credit card add up quickly. If you max out the gas/EV charging category each year, you'd earn $280 cash back, which is an extra $140 compared to the Citi Double Cash. Winner: Tie, it depends on your spending habits.\n\nRedemption options\n\nBeyond the earning rates, how you can redeem your rewards sets the Citi Double Cash and Costco Anywhere Visa apart. The Costco Visa is a cash-back card, but you receive a lump-sum certificate for your rewards once a year after your February statement closes. You can redeem this certificate for cash or merchandise at U.S. Costco locations and it expires on Dec. 31 the year it is issued. With the Citi Double Cash card, you earn cash back in the form of ThankYou\u00ae Points, giving you a wide range of redemption options and ThankYou\u00ae Points don't typically expire as long as you keep your account open. Most redemptions are worth one cent per point, so 100 points are worth $1. You can redeem ThankYou\u00ae Points with no minimum redemption amount for statement credits or direct deposits. ThankYou\u00ae Points can also be used for gift cards, charitable donations, booking travel through the Citi TravelSM portal and more. With the Citi Double Cash, you can even transfer your Citi points to a handful of partner loyalty programs: JetBlue TrueBlue, Wyndham Rewards, Shop Your Way and Choice Privileges. If you also have the Citi Strata Premier\u2120 Card (see rates and fees), you can pool your points and transfer them to all of the Citi ThankYou\u00ae Points partners at improved ratios. Winner: Citi Double Cash\n\nBenefits\n\nWhich should you get?\n\nIf you're looking for a credit card that offers simple rewards and redemptions, the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card is a good fit. It has a high flat-rate rewards structure and because you earn Citi ThankYou\u00ae Points, you can do more with your rewards. The Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi is more rewarding for travel and gas/EV charging purchases, but outside of those expenses, this card doesn't add much additional value compared to the Double Cash. The way you redeem rewards is also clunky and you can only redeem them at Costco. So the Costco Anywhere Visa only makes sense for a serious Costco shopper.\n\nCiti Double Cash\u00ae Card and Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi overview Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi Credit score requirement Fair to excellent Excellent Welcome offer Yes None Annual fee $0 $0, requires a paid Costco membership Rewards 2% back on every purchase (1% you buy and 1% when you pay) 5% cash back rewards on gas at Costco and earn 4% cash back on other eligible gas and electric vehicle (EV) charging purchases for the first $7,000 combined spend per year, and then 1% thereafter; 3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases and eligible travel, including Costco Travel; 2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com; 1% cash back on all other purchases Intro APR Yes None Standout benefits Extended warranty protection Travel and shopping protections\n\n\n\nFAQs Is the Citi Double Cash easy to get? The Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card is relatively easy to get as it only requires a fair credit score or higher, while the top cards typically require good credit or higher. Can you have more than one Citi credit card? You can have more than one Citi credit card. However, banks limit how much credit you're offered based on your income, credit score and other factors. How much credit you are currently issued from Citi could limit your opportunity to open new cards in the future. Can I use the Citi Double Cash Card in Costco? You cannot use a Citi Double Cash Card in Costco because it's a Mastercard and the only credit cards Costco accepts for in-store purchases are Visa cards. However, you can use Mastercard credit cards, like the Citi Double Cash, for online or in-app Costco purchases.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

            "content": "Costco's board of directors is fighting a proposal to eliminate its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program, per Fox Business.\n\nDuring an annual meeting of Costco shareholders scheduled for next month, investors are set to vote on a proposal by the National Center for Public Policy Research, which is challenging the legality of the wholesale retailer's DEI program.\n\nThe proposal comes after the Supreme Court ruled against considering race in college admissions, citing that it violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Several lawsuits have been filed against Fortune 100 companies, alleging that the Supreme Court ruling made corporate DEI programs illegal.\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, companies like Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Zoom, and John Deere have rolled back DEI commitments or laid off employees from DEI departments, the proposal cites.\n\n\"And yet Costco still has such a program, though it was apprehensive enough to recognize this as it recently and quietly rebranded its DEI program to \u2018People and Communities,\u2019\" the National Center for Public Policy Research wrote in its shareholder proposal. \"But sticking a new label on discriminatory practices does not protect Costco and its shareholders from these risks.\"\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research argues that Costco's rebranded program still openly expresses a \"commitment to equity,\" the company still employs a \"Chief Diversity Officer,\" still has a supplier diversity program that chooses suppliers based on race and sex, still factors in race and sex in hiring and promotion, and \"and still contributes shareholder money to organizations that advance the discriminatory agenda of DEI.\"\n\nThe foundation says Costco's DEI efforts could cost the company billions of dollars through legal challenges.\n\n\"With 310,000 employees, Costco likely has at least 200,000 employees who are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight,\" their proposal argues. \"Accordingly, even if only a fraction of those employees were to file suit, and only some of those prove successful, the cost to Costco could be tens of billions of dollars.\"\n\nCostco's board of directors defended its DEI practices, saying they are \"legally appropriate, and nothing in the proposal demonstrates otherwise.\" The board also argued that the National Center for Public Policy Research's \"broader agenda is not reducing risk for the Company but abolition of diversity initiatives.\"\n\n\"We welcome members from all walks of life and backgrounds. As our membership diversifies, we believe that serving it with a diverse group of employees enhances satisfaction,\" Costco's board wrote. \"Having diversity in our supplier base, including appropriate attention to small businesses, is beneficial for many of the same reasons diversity benefits our Company. We believe that it fosters creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer our members.\"\n\nThe board of directors penned a message directly to investors ahead of the January meeting.\n\n\"Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members, and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion follow our code of ethics: For our employees, these efforts are built around inclusion \u2013 having all of our employees feel valued and respected,\" the message reads. \"Our efforts at diversity, equity, and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed. This capacity is critical because we owe our success to our now over 300,000 employees around the globe.\"",
