Danaher has transformed itself from a diversified industrial into a health care-focused company through moves such as acquiring the bioprocessing division of GE\u2014one of the leading providers of equipment for making biologic drugs. Like many of its peers, the company has been dealing with the rapid growth and decline of COVID-19 vaccines and then elevated customer inventories from purchases meant to derisk COVID-related supply chain constraints. Shares had performed well heading into its release of Q3 earnings due to investor expectations around a reacceleration coming out of this inventory downcycle. However, results showed that the company was hesitant to indicate this headwind had passed, and management kept its expectations in check. While it is taking longer than anticipated, we believe the company remains well positioned as we head into 2025.\"\n\nIs Danaher Corporation (DHR) the Top Stock to Buy According to Akre Capital Management?\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is in 27th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Click: https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/hematology-testing-market\n\nReport Scope\n\nMarket Size (2029): $5.12 Billion\n\nMarket Size (2023): $3.87 Billion\n\nCAGR (2023-2029): 4.76%\n\nHistoric Year: 2020-2022\n\nBase Year: 2023\n\nForecast Year: 2024-2029\n\nMarket Segmentation: Product, Analyzer by Part, Analyzer by Volume, Test, End-User, and Geography\n\nGeographical Analysis: North America, Europe, APAC, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa\n\nThe hematology diagnostics market is experiencing significant growth as technological advancements and increasing awareness drive demand for accurate and efficient blood testing solutions. Hematology diagnostics, essential for diagnosing and managing various blood disorders such as anemia, leukemia, and hemophilia, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. A rising prevalence of blood-related diseases, technological innovations in diagnostic devices, and a greater emphasis on personalized medicine fuel the market's expansion. Additionally, supportive healthcare policies and a growing focus on early diagnosis and preventive care further propel the demand for advanced hematology diagnostics. As the industry evolves, healthcare providers and patients benefit from enhanced diagnostic accuracy, improved treatment outcomes, and more efficient healthcare delivery.\n\nSurge in Demand for Point-of-Care Hematology Testing Revolutionizes Patient Care\n\nPoint-of-care (POC) hematological tests are transforming the landscape of blood disorder diagnosis and overall health assessment. The advent of advanced POC hematology testing devices has significantly enhanced diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes. These devices, designed for use outside traditional laboratory settings, have gained substantial traction in recent years. Vendors are responding to this demand by offering cutting-edge hand-held and benchtop hematology analyzers and consumables, which can seamlessly integrate with other POC analyzers to provide rapid and precise clinical results.\n\nThe rise in popularity of POC hematology testing is particularly impactful in resource-limited and remote healthcare environments. POC hematology testing supports the shift towards personalized medicine in non-hospital settings by facilitating the performance of tests outside conventional reference laboratories. This integration helps reduce healthcare management costs and improves the responsiveness and safety of subsequent medical procedures.\n\nAs the availability of POC hematology analyzers and rapid test kits continues to expand, these tests are expected to become the preferred choice for most diagnostic scenarios, relegating central laboratories to handle only the more complex analyses that require specialized expertise. This growing acceptance and demand for POC hematology testing will drive significant market growth in the coming years.\n\nNorth America is the Largest Revenue Contributor to the Global Hematology Diagnostics Market\n\nThe North American hematology diagnostics market is booming due to a favorable patient demographic, rising blood disease prevalence, and supportive reimbursement policies. Increased cases of anemia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia, especially in the US and Canada, drive demand for advanced hematology analyzers and consumables. Many labs and hospitals are upgrading to more sophisticated devices amid a shortage of lab professionals, further intensified by the rise of telehealth. This shift boosts the need for efficient diagnostic tools. Vendors are responding with cutting-edge automated analyzers and consumables, positioning North America as a crucial market for advanced hematology solutions.\n\nKey Vendors\n\n\u00b7 Abbott\n\n\u00b7 Boule Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 Danaher\n\n\u00b7 Diatron\n\n\u00b7 Horiba\n\n\u00b7 Nihon Kohden\n\n\u00b7 Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics\n\n\u00b7 Siemens Healthineers\n\n\u00b7 Sysmex\n\n\u00b7 Alphatec Scientific\n\n\u00b7 Agappe Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 Analyticon Biotechnologies\n\n\u00b7 Balio Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 B&E Bio-technology\n\n\u00b7 Biosystems\n\n\u00b7 Bioway Biological Technology\n\n\u00b7 Bio-Rad\n\n\u00b7 Clindiag Systems\n\n\u00b7 Contech Medical Systems\n\n\u00b7 Convergent Technologies\n\n\u00b7 CPC Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 Dirui\n\n\u00b7 CPM Scientific\n\n\u00b7 Diagon\n\n\u00b7 Drucker Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 Erba Diagnostics\n\n\u00b7 Edan Instruments\n\n\u00b7 F.

            "content": "In the first quarter of 2025, healthcare stocks were among the strongest performers in the S&P index, outpacing the broader market. This marks a sharp contrast to their struggles in recent years. In 2024, the healthcare sector saw a modest gain of 2.06%, trailing the market's 25.02% return. A similar pattern was seen in 2023, with healthcare stocks rising just 2% while the overall market climbed 26%. Despite these challenges, healthcare remains a vital part of the economy, driven by increasing demand for medical products and services as the population ages. It is the fourth largest sector in the market, following technology, financials, and consumer discretionary. In the Russell MidCap Index, which tracks about 800 companies, healthcare ranks fifth, while in the small-cap Russell Index, it holds the third spot behind industrials and financials. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for US Bank Asset Management, said :\n\nAdditionally, companies specializing in life sciences tools and services faced lower demand, as COVID-19 testing declined and pandemic-related inventory levels were still being reduced. Policy concerns also weighed on the sector, particularly for insurers offering Medicare Advantage plans, as reimbursement rates fell short. Uncertainty surrounding upcoming elections further contributed to the healthcare sector\u2019s struggles. On a positive note, innovation remained strong, as the biotech industry saw promising clinical developments, and advancements in treatments for conditions like obesity and diabetes fueled significant growth in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nHealthcare stocks experienced a challenging year in 2024, lagging behind high-growth sectors like tech and AI. Market uncertainties and policy challenges also created obstacles for certain segments within the industry. In the first half of the year, investors focused on technology and communication services, drawing attention away from healthcare. While the sector showed some improvement in the latter half as the market rally expanded, certain segments continued to struggle with supply and demand imbalances caused by the pandemic. One major factor was the increased demand for delayed medical procedures, as patients sought treatments they had postponed. This benefited healthcare facilities and medical device manufacturers but put financial pressure on managed-care insurers.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best healthcare stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cInvestors can gain exposure to the healthcare sector by owning the S&P 500 through a passively managed index fund or ETF. Investors may also want to take a more selective approach, as the record demonstrates there can be varied performance within the healthcare sector.\u201d\n\nInvestors are taking a cautious approach as they assess potential policy shifts under the new administration. With a change in leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services, major healthcare companies could face greater scrutiny and may need to adjust to evolving policies.\n\nAs the Trump administration's policies come into focus, concerns are emerging over potential budget cuts that could directly affect healthcare organizations. With the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with cutting $1 trillion from a $6 trillion budget, reductions in healthcare spending appear likely. On January 17, the House Ways and Means Committee released a list of possible cuts to support the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among the proposals are eliminating the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds and potentially revoking the nonprofit status of hospitals and health systems. At the same time, hospital mergers and acquisitions have been steadily rebounding from pandemic-era lows, despite strict federal antitrust policies. However, it remains to be seen how future changes in regulatory leadership might influence M&A activity.\n\nDespite policy concerns, some billionaire investors remain confident in the healthcare sector\u2019s future. Carl Cook, with an estimated net worth of $10.3 billion, is among the wealthiest figures in the healthcare industry. He took over as CEO of his family's medical device company in 2011 following his father's death. In 2017, the company sold one of its subsidiaries to a drug delivery technology firm for $950 million. Cook also serves as president of a life sciences division focused on developing a cell therapy for urinary incontinence. Another billionaire investor in the healthcare sector is Ronda Stryker, with a net worth of $8.4 billion. Known for her contributions to medical technology and philanthropy, she has played a major role in advancing healthcare innovation. As the granddaughter of Dr. Homer Stryker, founder of a medical technology firm, she is committed to improving lives through medical advancements and social initiatives.\n\nDanaher Corporation (DHR): Among The Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy According To Billionaires\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and picked the top 10 companies operating in the healthcare sector with the highest number of billionaire investors in Q4 of 2024.

Danaher has consistently paid dividends for at least 30 years, placing it among the best healthcare stocks.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\u2019s sales amounted to $6.5 billion, reflecting 1% core revenue growth driven by strong demand for consumables used in commercialized therapies. The adjusted operating profit margin improved by 90 basis points to 29.6% due to cost-saving measures. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 2.4% year-over-year to $2.14, with free cash flow reaching $1.5 billion for the quarter. Over the full year, Danaher generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow, achieving a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 135%.\n\nOn January 9, Danaher Diagnostics LLC and Danaher Ventures LLC, both subsidiaries of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), announced a partnership with healthcare AI company Innovaccer Inc.

A significant driver is the robust recovery in the market, supported by the strength of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) pipeline and commercial demand. Cytiva, a key component of Danaher, has experienced consistent order growth over six consecutive quarters, indicating strong customer engagement and market presence.\n\nAdditionally, Danaher\u2019s strategic focus on technology enhancements through bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in process analytical technology, positions it well for future growth. Despite challenges in China, the long-term importance of this market remains, with trends suggesting increased platforming on established brands like Cytiva. Furthermore, the demand from contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) and the growing biosimilar market contribute positively to Danaher\u2019s outlook, supporting a favorable equipment demand scenario through 2026.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Souda is an analyst with an average return of -13.9% and a 27.22% success rate. Souda covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Illumina, Natera, and Guardant Health.\n\nIn another report released on March 28, Guggenheim also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $250.00 price target.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

This steadfast commitment to its investment philosophy has allowed the firm to consistently achieve its goal of compounding capital while mitigating risk.\n\nUnlike many asset managers, Akre Capital does not rely on setting specific sell targets when acquiring shares. Instead, it evaluates potential investments with the intent of holding them indefinitely, selling only when one of the core aspects of the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d is compromised. This long-term approach distinguishes the firm from Wall Street\u2019s frequent short-term focus on quarterly earnings surprises. Rather than reacting to minor earnings fluctuations, Akre Capital remains committed to businesses with solid economic fundamentals, viewing temporary price declines as opportunities to acquire high-quality companies at attractive valuations.\n\nThe foundation of Akre Capital\u2019s investment strategy is built on the principle that long-term returns closely correlate with the return on an owner\u2019s capital, assuming stable valuations and no distributions. Historically, the average return on U.S. equities has been around 9% to 10%, aligning with book value growth per share. Akre Capital seeks to outperform this benchmark by selecting businesses with superior return profiles, believing that these \u201ccompounding machines\u201d are the best way to achieve sustainable wealth accumulation. The firm places great emphasis on patience and discipline, resisting short-term market fluctuations in favor of long-term growth.\n\nAkre Capital Management follows a disciplined investment philosophy centered around identifying exceptional businesses managed by honest and capable leaders who reinvest free cash flow wisely. This approach, referred to as the \u201cthree-legged stool,\u201d emphasizes three key factors: extraordinary businesses, strong management teams, and effective reinvestment strategies. The firm\u2019s primary objective is to compound investor capital at above-average rates while maintaining a lower level of risk compared to industry norms. Led by founder Chuck Akre until 2020, the firm has consistently adhered to this philosophy, delivering strong results over the years.\n\nWe recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Akre Capital Management . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other top stocks to buy according to Akre Capital Management.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCharles T. \u201cChuck\u201d Akre, Jr. is a seasoned asset manager with over five decades of experience overseeing private funds, mutual funds, and separately managed accounts. He founded Akre Capital Management in 1989 after spending 21 years at Johnston, Lemon & Co., a NYSE member firm, where he gained expertise in research, asset management, and branch operations. During his time there, he developed a deep understanding of securities and investment strategies, which laid the foundation for his own firm\u2019s approach.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2000, Akre Capital Management operated under the umbrella of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. in Washington, D.C., providing Chuck with additional resources to refine and expand his investment philosophy. However, in 2000, he chose to take the firm private again, emphasizing independence and a long-term investment approach. He relocated Akre Capital to Middleburg, Virginia, a rural setting that reflected his preference for a focused and patient investment process, free from the distractions of Wall Street\u2019s short-term mentality.\n\nAt Akre Capital, Chuck Akre\u2019s leadership has shaped the firm\u2019s long-term success, ensuring consistent capital growth for investors. Over the years, he has earned a reputation for his disciplined and insightful approach to asset management. Today, Akre continues to contribute his expertise as Chairman of Akre Capital Management. He works alongside John Neff, the portfolio manager of the Akre Focus Fund, ensuring that the firm\u2019s investment principles remain intact. With decades of experience and a commitment to compounding capital at superior rates, Chuck Akre\u2019s influence in the investment world remains significant.\n\nAs of its most recent filing for the fourth quarter of 2024, Akre Capital Management manages approximately $11.56 billion in 13F securities. The firm maintains a highly concentrated portfolio, with its top ten holdings accounting for 94.82% of total assets. This focused investment approach reflects Akre Capital\u2019s commitment to selecting a small group of high-quality businesses with strong growth potential and disciplined management.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Akre Capital Management\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings.

To assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Founded in 1984 by Steven and Mitchell Rales, the company is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and operates through three primary divisions: biotechnology, diagnostics, and life sciences. With a strong emphasis on scientific and technological innovation, Danaher aims to address critical health challenges and improve quality of life worldwide. Originally established as DMG, Inc. in 1969, the company underwent several transformations before adopting its current name, inspired by a Montana creek. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) was also among the first North American companies to implement Kaizen principles, focusing on continuous improvement and operational efficiency.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, Akre Capital Management held 1.78 million shares of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), valued at approximately $407 million, making up 3.52% of Charles Akre\u2019s investment portfolio. Hedge fund interest in Danaher also increased, with 101 out of 1,009 funds tracked by Insider Monkey holding positions worth nearly $7.07 billion by the end of the fourth quarter, up from 98 funds in the previous quarter. This growing investor confidence highlights Danaher\u2019s strong market position and long-term potential.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) reported its fourth-quarter earnings, posting a net revenue of $6.54 billion, reflecting a 2% increase year over year. However, the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.14, falling short of analyst expectations by $0.02. Analysts maintain a stable outlook for the stock, projecting 2025 revenues of $24.1 billion and a 5% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $5.74, aligning closely with prior estimates. Despite the slight earnings miss, Danaher\u2019s steady revenue growth and commitment to innovation reinforce its position as a key player in the healthcare and life sciences industries, making it one of the top stocks to buy according to Akre Capital Management.\n\nMar Vista U.S. Quality Strategy stated the following regarding Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cHealthcare stocks in general, and Life Science tool businesses more specifically, ended 2024 on a downbeat as investor sentiment is still cautious on the market\u2019s post-Covid recovery. Hopes for an above average industry growth rebound in 2025 were muted by managements\u2019 more cautious guidance. Investor concerns over the Trump administration\u2019s healthcare leadership and policies further dampened optimism for a strong 2025. Tariff impacts, NIH funding and Biotech/pharma spending top the list of investor concerns. We believe Mettler-Toledo\u2019s and Danaher Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:DHR) secular growth opportunities stay intact. Both businesses compete in key, defensible segments of the industry\u2019s value chain and have strong pricing power and margin expansion opportunities. Long-term secular drivers for scientific research and commercialization of biologic therapeutics and molecular diagnostic should drive above-average growth for both businesses.\u201d\n\nOverall, DHR ranks 10th on our list of top stocks to buy according to Akre Capital Management. While we acknowledge the potential for DHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Funding has become a challenge for gene editing start-ups with companies cutting staff and trimming pipelines.\n\nRecently, CRISPR leaders across the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) ecosystem, which spans multiple California institutes and hospitals including UCSF, Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital, and UCLA, came together to change the tone by celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures collaboration, 10 years after IGI\u2019s founding.\n\nFyodor Urnov, PhD, professor of molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and director of technology & translation at IGI, who recently authored a 6,000-word editorial in The CRISPR Journal to \u201cgive Cas a chance,\u201d said the pioneers of CRISPR gene editing have built an electric car in a universe that was built for early model internal combustion engines.\n\n\u201cIt is not the first time in the history of technology that we have invented something, but parts of the world have not caught up,\u201d said Urnov in an interview with GEN. \u201cIn this case, CRISPR fundamentally can do what we wanted to do, but a good chunk of the regulatory environment, for example, putting CRISPR into a person, hasn\u2019t changed in 15 years.\u201d\n\nThe Danaher partnership enables a new research program at the IGI and is also the largest investment yet from the Danaher Beacons program, which funds pioneering academic research with the goal of developing innovative technologies and applications for human health.\n\nAmong the event speaker line-up were Don Kohn, MD, distinguished professor of microbiology at UCLA, Jennifer Puck, MD, professor emeritus of pediatrics at UCSF, Tippi MacKenzie, MD, professor of surgery at Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital and professor of children\u2019s health at UCSF, and more.\n\nThe collaboration, set to span a total of four years, provides the IGI team with support from Danaher and several of its operating companies, including Integrated DNA Technologies, Cytiva, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, and Aldevron.\n\n\u201cOur mission in academic science is to create new things and explore new ideas. What we\u2019re not good at is developing ideas so that they can be widely available, affordable, and disseminated,\u201d said Doudna. \u201cThis partnership is our effort to bring those two areas together so that CRISPR can have a global impact.\u201d\n\nUrnov said the world is not a \u201cmagical machine\u201d for distributing technology equitably and fairly, such that suddenly everyone benefits from the best. \u201cThere is no magic wand that enables a technology to change the world,\u201d Urnov told GEN. \u201cThe Danaher partnership is about realizing that fact for CRISPR gene editing and building it into a technology that will fundamentally change how we treat a large class of human diseases.\u201d\n\nCRISPR cookbook\n\nUrnov emphasized that the goal of the partnership is to develop a robust clinically validated \u201ccookbook\u201d that contains solutions and sources for how to develop CRISPR cures for your disease of interest.\n\nUpon launch, the collaboration was initially aimed to drive two preclinical gene-editing therapies from design to initial regulatory submission, with a focus on a family of rare and genetic immunological disorders known as inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), including two diseases known as ARTEMIS-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ART-SCID) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). IEIs have several advantages that the collaborators believe make them amenable to the center\u2019s approach, including an extensive patient registry and a transplant-based route of administration that bypasses key challenges in delivering CRISPR molecules to appropriate tissues.\n\nAccording to Danaher, the Beacon for CRISPR Cures will be designed to yield a \u201cstacked\u201d manufacturing platform for gene editing therapies and increase the number of patients treated with CRISPR-based technology from approximately 210 patients to many thousands over the next decade.\n\nSadik Kassim, PhD, CTO, genomic medicine at Danaher, highlighted that the Danaher IGI Beacon was selected by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine as a keystone program at the FDA Scientific Exchange for Advancing Gene Editing Platforms for Rare Diseases held last November. The recognition showcased impactful platforms that transform scientifically feasible treatments into commercially viable options.\n\n\u201cTo be able to tell the world \u2018this is what needs to happen\u2019 within a year time frame, with Danahar and IGI at the forefront, is an important milestone, in addition to the actual operationalization of this entire concept,\u201d Kassim told GEN.\n\nKassim also noted that the collaboration has captivated the attention of many other academic centers with several wanting to apply or contribute to the \u201ccookbook\u201d concept.\n\n\u201cHopefully the collaboration will be a catalyst for a bigger convergence between the entire community, with Danaher and IGI being the center of that entire constellation,\u201d Kassim continued.\n\nDanaher has yet to comment publicly on future milestones for the collaboration, but noted that it expects more news to be announced at the 2025 American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) meeting being held this coming May in New Orleans.",

            "content": "Nearly 8 years ago, the first CAR T therapy was approved by the FDA for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This breakthrough therapy used the patient\u2019s own modified T cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Since then, six more CAR T therapies have been approved to treat forms of lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma, with many patients experiencing lasting remissions.\n\n\n\nHowever, to expand the range of diseases that can be treated with CAR T \u2013 as well as address the major manufacturing and cost challenges associated with cells therapies \u2013 new techniques and technologies must be developed, tested, scaled, and deployed to patients in need. As part of the Danaher Beacons program, teams at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (CCI, founded by CAR T pioneer Carl June) and Cytiva, a Danaher operating company, are working together to optimize a workflow for engineering human stem cells using lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of gene editing enzymes. This optimized delivery method may enable new cell therapies that address major clinical unmet needs and may set the stage for a single CAR T product to treat a majority of blood cancers.\n\nAll about the antigens\n\nIn traditional CAR T treatment, T cells are extracted from the patient and programmed to express a protein (the chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) on their surface that recognizes a specific protein on the surface of the target cells (the antigen). When the antigen and CAR interact, the T cell destroys that target cell. Since CAR T cells will kill any cell displaying that antigen, an ideal CAR T treatment would target an antigen that is only expressed on malignant cells and not on normal cells. However, disease-specific antigens that are suitable for targeting by CART cells are vanishingly rare. In the case of B cell ALL, the CAR T treatment was instead designed to attack all B cells. \u201cThis approach works because we can live without normal B cells. Unfortunately, we cannot live without hematopoietic stem cells and their myeloid progeny, which are the normal cellular counterparts of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML,\u201d says Dr. Saar Gill, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Hematology-Oncology in the Perelman School of Medicine. In AML, cancer affects hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitor cells, which normally produce monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes, all of which are responsible for defending the body against infection. \u201cWithout myeloid cells, patients can\u2019t survive very long, so we needed a new approach to treat AML with CAR T,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nThis new approach sounds counter intuitive \u2013 at first. \u201cThe novel idea here is that we are targeting a receptor, CD45, which is expressed on all nucleated blood cells. This means that if we released this CD45-targeting CAR T in an unprepared patient, it would kill all blood cells whether they were benign or malignant, and also very likely the patient,\u201d explains Dr. Friederike Herbst, PhD, the director of the Human Genome Editing Lab at the CCI at Penn. She continues, \u201cThe key step is that we must first generate a hematopoietic system that is invisible to this cell therapy, that way the CD45-targeting CAR T cells only attack the cancer cells.\u201d\n\nEditing for invisibility\n\nTo develop this invisible hematopoietic system (i.e., all the blood-forming tissues and circulating blood cells in the body), the CCI team is leveraging the gene editing technology known as base editing. \u201cBase editing is a highly precise way of changing one DNA base into another, which could allow you to turn a gene on or off, or change its expression level, or in this case, prevent recognition by an antigen receptor,\u201d says Dr. Gill. \u201cCD45 is an essential protein, meaning that its function must be maintained, but we found that we can use base editing to change just the sequence that directly interacts with the CD45-targeting CAR. In this way, the CAR no longer recognizes these cells and will not kill them.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo repopulate a patient\u2019s body with this invisible hematopoietic system, the CCI team is advancing the use of base editors in HSPCs, or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. \u201cThis is a very diverse population of cells that can give rise to the full complement of immune cells,\u201d says Dr. Herbst. The idea is that HSPCs are extracted from the patient, edited ex vivo, then replaced and allowed to divide and differentiate into a functional and CAR T-cell invisible hematopoietic system. Then the CD45 CAR T treatment is administered. The challenge is that editing HSPCs is no easy feat.\n\nThe devil is in the delivery\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in genome engineering is getting the editing machinery inside the cell. \u201cWe express the CAR using a modified virus as the shuttle into the T cell. This results in a consistent expression of the CAR for the life of the cell. However, we can\u2019t use this same approach for delivering the base editor into the HPSCs because there we only want the base editor to be expressed for a short time period, what we call \u2018transient expression.\u2019 Without transient expression, we risk off-target edits and thus toxicity,\u201d explains Dr. Herbst.\n\n\n\nThe standard method for delivering genetic material for transient expression in cells is called electroporation, and it uses a brief electric current to disrupt the cell membrane. However, \u201cCells don't like being electrocuted and zapped,\u201d says Dr. Gill. \u201cWe can only extract a limited amount of HSPCs from a patient and so we must make sure they are healthy and happy. A lot of cells die during electroporation and that means you may not have enough cells to treat the patient.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe CCI team is working with Cytiva to test and optimize a different approach: lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs. \u201cLNPs are a mixture of four different types of lipids that protect and deliver genetic material, such as the RNA sequence for the base editor in this case, into cells,\u201d says Dr. Samuel Clarke, Director of R&D at Cytiva. \u201cLNPs have several important benefits that are essential for enabling the HSPC base editing application. First, they are able to create a relatively high amount of viable cells. Second, treatment of cells with LNPs considered to be a consistent and replicable process. Third, we\u2019ve developed a scalable LNP manufacturing platform. These benefits facilitate rapid clinical translation of LNPs into new applications.\u201d\n\nCollaboration is the key\n\nLaunched two years ago, this collaboration has yielded positive results.\n\n\u201cThe Beacon is a great initiative because it brings together our expertise in gene editing and patient care with Danaher\u2019s unique technologies and industry perspective. Together we\u2019ve created a workflow to genetically engineer both T cells and HSPCs using LNPs,\u201d says Dr. Herbst.\n\nThis work is an important step towards developing a CAR T treatment for AML. \u201cAML is a very aggressive disease. The overall survival rate is really low and there are no proper treatment modalities available to efficiently treat those patients. We believe that our strategy with this LNP-modified product will make a big difference for these underserved patients,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut what is really exciting is that because CD45 is expressed on all nucleated blood cells, this treatment strategy could be applied to a huge range of hematopoietic disorders, whether they are T cell malignancies, B cell malignancies, myeloid malignancies, multiple myeloma or autoimmune diseases.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration also addresses two of the other major hurdles when it comes to cell therapies: manufacturing and cost. \u201cTo make cell therapies more accessible to patients, we need to address the manufacturing process. Our work shows that LNPs can increase the total number of edited cells, and this potentially streamlines and improves transferability of the whole manufacturing process,\u201d Dr. Gill.\n\nDr. Herbst adds, \u201cToday LNPs are helping us to generate a high number of patient-specific edited HSPCs ex vivo, but in the future with additional development they could enable us to create an off-the-shelf cell therapy product or to execute the editing step directly in a patient\u2019s body,\u201d Dr. Herbst explains. \u201cBoth of these approaches have the potential to drastically reduce manufacturing costs and make cell therapy easier to deploy to patients in need.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe benefits from this work have not been one sided. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from the CCI team as they have rigorously tested our T cell and HSPCs LNP kits to achieve successful base editing, a new application for these LNP kits. And with Cytiva\u2019s new biomanufacturing facility coming online, we are well-positioned to support CCI to translate these LNPs into clinical trials,\u201d says Dr. Clarke. \u201cAs a scientist, there\u2019s nothing more rewarding than the opportunity to see patients benefit from your work.\u201d\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Financial Disclosure: The laboratories of Drs.

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Danaher fair value estimate is US$242\n\nWith US$212 share price, Danaher appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\nOur fair value estimate is 9.0% lower than\n\nDoes the March share price for Danaher Corporation ( ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.36b US$5.83b US$6.33b US$7.08b US$7.59b US$8.04b US$8.44b US$8.81b US$9.14b US$9.46b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Est @ 7.27% Est @ 5.91% Est @ 4.97% Est @ 4.30% Est @ 3.84% Est @ 3.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$5.0k US$5.1k US$5.2k US$5.4k US$5.4k US$5.4k US$5.3k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$9.5b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.8%) = US$236b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$236b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$121b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$173b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$212, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Danaher as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.953. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Danaher\n\nStrength Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Earnings declined over the past year. Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Danaher, we've put together three pertinent elements you should further examine:\n\nFinancial Health: Does DHR have a healthy balance sheet?

            "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Diagnostics Stocks to Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other best diagnostics stocks to invest in right now.\n\nOverview of the Clinical Diagnostics Market\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the clinical diagnostics market has a size of $88.79 billion as of 2025. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% between 2025 and 2030, reaching $115.94 billion at the end of the forecast period. While North America is the largest market in the domain at present, Asia-Pacific takes the lead as the fastest growing.\n\nAs per Grand View Research, the growth in the global clinical diagnostics industry is attributed to the rising demand for lab automation and the development of specialized tests for disease management and early disease detection. In addition, the growing use of point-of-care diagnostics products has also driven a decentralization trend in the healthcare industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Biotech Stocks To Invest In and 11 Best Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAI in Diagnostics Healthcare: Is A New Trend Emerging?\n\nOne of the primary trends emerging in the sector is the growing use of artificial intelligence. AI-powered diagnostic tools are revolutionizing the interpretation of medical images with high accuracy, leading to increased adoption. These tools not only improve disease diagnostics but also allow medical professionals to develop more effective and personalized treatment plans, elevating the overall healthcare experience.\n\nOn February 24, GlobeNewswire reported that the US AI diagnostics market was worth around $655 million in 2024, as per estimates by Precedence Statistics. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.7% between 2025 and 2034, reaching $4.29 billion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nOn February 4, Eric Lefkofsky, founder and CEO of Tempus AI, appeared on CNBC to talk about the impact of generative AI in diagnostics healthcare, among other things. He was of the view that generative AI and large language models aren\u2019t more impactful in any other avenue as much as they are in healthcare. Diagnostics sit at the center of healthcare, as almost every other major decision a doctor makes is undertaken after ordering some kind of laboratory test. If we can make diagnostics more intelligent, it would be possible to route patients to the best possible and most optimal therapy.\n\nGenerative AI is thus allowing access to new tools that help structure and make sense of disparate information and use that information, whether it be physician progress notes, pathology reports, molecular data, CAT scans, MRIs, or others, to make sure that the patients are on the optimal therapy path. He further said that the promise of this technology is twofold: it is enormous in helping patients live better and longer lives while reducing the substantial waste in the US healthcare system. Generative AI is thus significantly impactful in healthcare diagnostics.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 diagnostics and research stocks. We then selected the top 12 with the highest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q4 2024, and ranked them in ascending order. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 101\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) designs, manufactures, and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services, making it a significant diagnostics stock. It operates through Diagnostics, Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Environmental and Applied Solutions. Its Biotechnology segment offers a range of equipment and consumables for biological medicines, while the Life Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, devices, consumables, and other services for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.\n\nStrong free cash flow generation is a competitive point for the company, as it generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2024. This resulted in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of around 135%. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is also active in the M&A domain, completing several strategic acquisitions throughout fiscal 2024 that brought innovative solutions to the company.\n\nDanaher Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:DHR) focus on high-margin bioprocessing in its life sciences sector is central to its growth strategy. The anticipated recovery in bioprocessing is expected to significantly increase the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) in the coming years.\n\nOn March 21, Goldman Sachs upgraded Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) to Buy from Neutral with a $260 price target. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund was also bullish on the company, and stated the following regarding Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) released its 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report. It highlighted several milestones across its three pillars of sustainability (building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and the planet, and protecting the environment). The company has committed to setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi), including reaching net-zero value chain emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nOverall, DHR ranks 1st on our list of the best diagnostics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other stocks that Wall Street is calling bullish amid market turmoil.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 8.6% in a month while the Nasdaq has lost nearly 13%. Markets continue to scare retail investors as stock after stock struggles to deal with the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictable and aggressive policies.\n\nWhile it is advisable to stay out of the market till the dust settles, one also can\u2019t deny that it is times like these that bring opportunities. We decided to come up with a list of stocks that are expected to go up even in the existing gloomy environment.\n\nTo come up with the list of 10 stocks that Wall Street is bullish on, we looked at stocks that were recently upgraded by analysts and have performed well in the last 5 days of trading.\n\nDanaher Corporation (DHR): Among Stocks Wall Street Is Calling Bullish Amid Market Turmoil\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a manufacturer, designer, and marketer of medical, industrial, research, and professional products and services. The company operates in the Diagnostics, Biotechnology, and Life Sciences segments. DHR experienced a 15% downturn in the previous year.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was upgraded last week by Stifel from Hold to Buy with a price target of $260. This upgrade was fueled by the analysts\u2019 belief that the company\u2019s recent cost-saving initiatives are likely to have a positive impact on revenue growth. Though the 2025 guidance was lower than expected, analysts think new cost-saving actions could boost revenue and margin growth. The stock jumped 2% on the upgrade and continued to recover past year\u2019s losses.\n\nDanaher (NYSE:DHR) reported FQ424 earning results recently. As per the result, the company exceeded revenue estimates by 1.2% YoY. While it missed EPS estimates by a small margin, analysts believe that the company\u2019s 1Q2025 results may be less exposed to risks associated with academic/government demand.\n\nRegardless of the less impressive current profit profile, the company is expected to drive significant acceleration in profits in the next 12 months, reaching an EPS of $9 in FY2026 as per estimates.\n\nOverall, DHR ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Wall Street is calling bullish amid market turmoil. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

However, it is illegal for adults to have sexual relations with a child under 18 if they are entrusted to teach them, with perpetrators facing up to 12 years in prison.\n\nThe father told RUV he had never seen himself as a victim in this situation, but noted that he was in a difficult place in his life and at home turned to the church group for support.\n\nIceland\u2019s public broadcaster reported that the relationship was kept secret but that the father was present for the birth of his child and initially allowed contact, but nearly all access was cut off before his son turned 1.\n\nHe was however required to pay child support for 18 years.\n\nThe young father sought assistance from the Ministry of Justice and the church\u2019s family service to see his child, but Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir refused him visitation rights, according to Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster.\n\nShortly after RUV\u2019s report on Thursday, Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir resigned from her ministerial position, the public broadcaster said. She will continue to represent the People\u2019s Party as a member of parliament.\n\nIceland\u2019s prime minister said Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir had met with the country\u2019s three party leaders but it had been her decision to resign, according to RUV.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the options together and heard her account of the matter in detail for the first time at that meeting,\u201d Prime Minister Kristr\u00fan Frostad\u00f3ttir said at a news conference Friday, RUV reported. The leader reiterated that Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir had swiftly taken responsibility by resigning.\n\n\u201cOf course, this is an unfortunate matter, but it has nothing to do with our work,\u201d Frostad\u00f3ttir said, adding that the prime minister\u2019s office had not finished investigating the matter since it was brought to their attention a week ago.\n\nCNN has reached out to Th\u00f3rsd\u00f3ttir and Iceland\u2019s Ministry for Education and Children for comment.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            "content": "By Danielle Danaher, Final Year French and Spanish\n\nThis year\u2019s season of The Traitors had a lot to live up to after the finale of season 2 saw Harry, a series-long traitor, commit one of the most gut-wrenching acts of treachery in gameshow history (even worse than that infamous episode of Golden Balls). If the last season has taught this year\u2019s contestants anything, it\u2019s that you simply cannot trust anybody. This chilling truth created a group of players who were somewhat lacking in camaraderie, with suspicions and paranoia eventually severing any remaining bonds between allies and friends. It\u2019s the kind of show that reveals the worst qualities of human nature, which makes for undeniably superb television.\n\nSeason 3 had all the tropes of a classic series of The Traitors: more pointless missions (though admittedly ramped up for dramatic effect), more servings of camp-gothic realness from Claudia Winkleman, and more butchered spellings of names on chalkboards. However, it did run the risk of becoming a little bit repetitive. Despite a few added twists, like three contestants being immediately kicked off the train and off the show in episode 1, it did lack some of the jaw-dropping revelations that made the previous season so memorable\u2014namely, Diane\u2019s iconic delivery of \u201cPaul just couldn\u2019t be my son\u2026 but Ross is!\u201d Some viewers even speculated that Frankie and Freddie might also be mother and son, but that might have been too on the nose.\n\nAmong the show\u2019s viral moments, 70-year-old opera singer Linda is largely responsible. From turning her head during the first round-table when Claudia said \u2018Traitors\u2019, to acting performances so bad they gave Curtis and AJ Pritchard\u2019s Hollyoaks cameo a run for their money. Charlotte\u2019s fake Welsh accent, which she hoped would make her more trustworthy, also deserves an honourable mention, since actual Welsh-born Elen was ruthlessly banished in episode 2.\n\nCourtesy of IMDb\n\nOne thing that never fails to amuse me is the faithfuls\u2019 tendency to cling to any minorly evil-sounding phrase or misstep, rather than concrete evidence like Linda\u2019s head turn, in their desperate bid to catch a traitor. Kas happened to be one of the contestants that fell victim to this tactic, as Joe fixated on a glint in his eye, and Jake ran with the narrative of him being a doctor by day, murderer by night. This provided the opportunity for a beautiful exit by Kas, who taunted them with the idea that they were right all along before revealing his true faithful status, and consequently, their stupidity.\n\nThe penultimate episode proved to be arguably more entertaining and intense than the finale thanks to the introduction of the all-new \u2018Seer\u2019 role who had the ability to reveal the true identity of one other player. When Frankie was awarded this privilege she chose Charlotte, the only remaining traitor, turning the whole game on its head with a cliffhanger that literally left me screaming on my sofa. While Charlotte did put up a good fight to feign her faithfulness, and lost her dignity in the process, there was no coming back from this information. She immediately lost her trustworthiness despite pouring what must have been copious amounts of energy into that Welsh accent. This revelation of the final traitor within the first few minutes of the last episode resulted in a slightly anticlimactic resolution that left viewers feeling a bit deflated.\n\nNonetheless, a new rule that forbade the finalists from revealing their true identities when banished ensured the drama continued to unfold among the faithfuls. Sadly, Frankie and Alexander were denied the money before the night was up, with Leanne and Jake doubling their winnings (because they might as well). One of the potentially unfair flaws of the programme is that those faithfuls who show any trace of intellect are quickly murdered or banished as the series goes on, leaving those without a clue one step closer to the prize pot (cue Leanne being dumbfounded she was still there at every roundtable).\n\nOverall, however, this series of The Traitors provided endless delight and was exactly what the British public needed to justify our hibernation during those bleak January nights. Despite the fact that it follows the same format every year, one thing is for certain: I will be sat and ready for Season 4\u2014I need this show injected into my veins.\n\nWhat did you think of season three?",

            "content": "Danaher shares are finally trading at a more attractive valuation, according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Matthew Sykes upgraded Danaher to buy from neutral and set a 12-month price target of $260, which implies 23.7% potential upside. Shares of the global conglomerate, known for its biotech, diagnostics, and life sciences businesses, are down 8.4% year to date and more than 16.5% over the past year. The comedown in 2025 consensus earnings expectations on Danaher, particularly in its biotech segment, have led to more realistic growth expectations for the company, Sykes said. \"With conviction in a bioprocessing recovery and long term growth, a lower bar to maintain a beat and raise dynamic, and a more reasonable valuation premium vs the sector, we believe DHR has the potential to outperform our broader coverage over the next 12 months,\" Sykes said in a Friday note to clients. \"Currently, we see expectations as appropriately measured for the current environment and the '25 EV/EBITDA multiple has de-rated 3 turns from peak levels offering a more attractive entry point into a stock we see as a long-term compounder undergoing short term/cyclical issues,\" he added, noting the stock's significant underperformance this year against the S & P 500 and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) ETF . DHR 1Y mountain Danaher stock. Sykes said Danaher's initial cost savings announced in the company's most recent 10-K filing could lead to potentially greater margins in 2025 and 2026. Another catalyst for the stock could be a comeback in Danaher's biotech segment, which has seen consensus organic growth estimates drop by 42%, according to Sykes. More broadly, Goldman believes that the bioprocessing end market itself is set for a recovery after facing supply chain constraints and inventory issues. That should benefit tools players such as Danaher, Sykes said. \"We see the Biotech segment as driving a recovery in the shares over the next 12 months fully offsetting pressure in China and the de minimis exposure to the Academic & Government segment as insulating them from the challenges in this end market,\" he wrote in the note.",

The first is the investment partnership, as I described with Innovaccer, where in addition to capital, the company and Danaher form a partnership. These partnerships could involve co-developing, co-marketing, co-distributing the technology, to name a few. For these investments, we are looking for serial entrepreneurs and founding teams with clear passion and drive, and who have a proven track record of translating innovation into impactful products and successful companies. As we are focused on large-scale change, these technologies need to be backed by an effective and strong team.\n\nThe second is what we call the \u201cPioneer Program,\u201d and this leverages venture creation to develop transformative companies with new and differentiated products that address key challenges in healthcare and address specific Danaher portfolio product gaps. Here, we work with leading entrepreneurs and scientific experts across academia and industry to originate these companies, based on their pioneering research, technology and intellectual property, and accelerate their path to commercialization and patient impact.\n\nAn example is BlueWhale Bio, which is developing a novel solution to improve cell and gene therapy manufacturing. We worked with founders Carl June and James Riley at the University of Pennsylvania to launch the company, secure multiple rounds of funding, and they are now collaborating with Cytiva to develop a portfolio of products with the potential to bring the benefits of cell therapy to patients faster and at lower cost.",

            "content": "Danaher Corporation DHR has failed to impress investors with its recent operational performance due to weakness across its businesses and high operational expenses.\n\n\n\nBased in Washington, DC, Danaher is engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing medical, research and industrial products and services throughout the world.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that continue taking a toll on the firm.\n\nFactors Affecting DHR Stock\n\nBusiness Weakness: Despite recovery, sluggish demand across the pharma and biotech markets in China has been weighing on Danaher\u2019s Instrument businesses under the Life Sciences segment. The company has been witnessing a sales decline in mass spectrometry, flow cytometry & lab automation solutions and microscopy businesses due to soft demand for equipment in major end-markets. Core revenues from the Life Sciences segment declined 2% on a year-over-year basis in 2024. Softness in the genomics consumables business, owing to tepid sales in the gene reading and proteins product lines, remains concerning for the segment.\n\n\n\nAlso, weakness in the Biotechnology segment raises concerns for the company. Sluggish demand in the discovery and medical business has been weighing on the performance of the Biotechnology segment. The segment\u2019s core revenues declined 4.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2024. Despite improvement, equipment demand remained subdued as customers remained cautious with their capital spending.\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter of 2025, Danaher expects its adjusted core sales from continuing operations to decline in low-single digits on a year-over-year basis.\n\n\n\nRising Costs & Expenses: The company\u2019s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 5.9% year over year in 2024 due to the impact of the Abcam acquisition. The metric, as a percentage of net sales, increased 180 basis points to 32.5% in the year. Escalating expenses if not controlled are likely to hurt the company\u2019s bottom line in the quarters ahead.\n\n\n\nHigh Debt Levels: Danaher exited fourth-quarter 2024 with a long-term debt of $15.5 billion. Its current liabilities were $6.8 billion, higher than the cash equivalents of $2.1 billion. Also, interest expenses in 2024 remained high at $278 million. High debt levels can increase its financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability in the quarters ahead.\n\nDHR Stock\u2019s Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOver the past six months, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company\u2019s shares have plunged 24.7% compared with the industry\u2019s 15% decline.\n\n\n\nEstimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Danaher\u2019s 2025 earnings has trended down from $8.31 per share to $7.63 on 12 downward estimate revisions against none upward. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings decreased from $9.19 per share to $8.57 on seven downward estimate revisions against none upward.",

            "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Danaher's (NYSE:DHR) recent performance, when its stock has declined 12% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Danaher is:\n\n7.9% = US$3.9b \u00f7 US$50b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Danaher's Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Danaher's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 9.7%, we may spare it some thought. Even so, Danaher has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 5.5%. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Danaher's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 7.6% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is DHR worth today? The helps visualize whether DHR is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Danaher Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nIn Danaher's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 15% (or a retention ratio of 85%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.\n\nMoreover, Danaher is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 14%. Regardless, the future ROE for Danaher is predicted to rise to 11% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Danaher has some positive attributes. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

This might have investors contemplating their next move.\n\nIs now the time to buy Danaher, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free.\n\nDespite the more favorable entry price, we're cautious about Danaher. Here are three reasons why we avoid DHR and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Is Danaher Not Exciting?\n\nStarted as a real estate investment trust, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) designs and manufactures professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services.\n\n1. Core Business Falling Behind as Demand Declines\n\nIn addition to reported revenue, organic revenue is a useful data point for analyzing Research Tools & Consumables companies. This metric gives visibility into Danaher\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, Danaher\u2019s organic revenue averaged 5.4% year-on-year declines. This performance was underwhelming and implies it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy. It also suggests Danaher might have to lean into acquisitions to grow, which isn\u2019t ideal because M&A can be expensive and risky (integrations often disrupt focus).\n\n2. Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim\n\nForecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company\u2019s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\n\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Danaher\u2019s revenue to rise by 1.1%. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n\n3. Shrinking Adjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Danaher\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 5.2 percentage points over the last two years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Its adjusted operating margin for the trailing 12 months was 28.6%.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nDanaher isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Following the recent decline, the stock trades at 25.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $207 per share). This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - you can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. Let us point you toward one of Charlie Munger\u2019s all-time favorite businesses.\n\nStocks We Like More Than Danaher\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.\n\nStocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Sterling Infrastructure (+1,096% five-year return).

As healthcare costs rise, and access to medical services remains limited in rural areas, digital diagnostic tools offer solutions that enable healthcare providers to diagnose, monitor, and manage patient conditions remotely.\n\n\n\nDevices like wearable technologies, sensors, and mobile health applications allow clinicians to access real-time health data, facilitating timely diagnoses and interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to telemedicine, and the demand for remote consultations and diagnostics is expected to continue post-pandemic, further enhancing healthcare delivery in the region. This growth is supported by advancements in mobile technology, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, offering greater accessibility, convenience, and optimized healthcare efficiency.\n\n\n\nKey Market Challenges\n\nData Privacy and Security Concerns\n\n\n\nA major challenge facing the growth of the digital diagnostics market in Asia-Pacific is concerns surrounding data privacy and security. The collection and storage of sensitive patient information via digital health tools heighten the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and misuse of health data. Several countries in the region lack standardized regulations and frameworks to address these concerns effectively. The absence of strong data security measures creates hesitation among both healthcare providers and patients regarding the adoption of digital diagnostic technologies. Furthermore, the challenge of complying with varying data protection laws across different countries in the region adds complexity for companies operating in the digital diagnostics sector.\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nIntegration of Wearable Health Devices\n\n\n\nWearable health devices, including fitness trackers, smartwatches, and health monitoring patches, are rapidly gaining traction in the Asia-Pacific region. These devices continuously collect data on vital health parameters, such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, and physical activity, which can be analyzed to monitor chronic diseases and detect early warning signs of medical conditions. With the increasing focus on preventive healthcare and growing adoption of personal health monitoring, the integration of wearable devices into digital diagnostics is on the rise. These devices empower patients with greater control over their health, while enabling healthcare providers to track patient progress and intervene when necessary. Advancements in technology have made these wearables more sophisticated, enhancing their capabilities for real-time diagnostics and health management.\n\n\n\nKey Players Profiled in Asia-Pacific's Digital Diagnostics Market",

            "content": "After their incredibly successful inaugural event, the second Craig Jones Invitational (CJI 2) is set to happen on August, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nFew details on their follow up show have been revealed, but we do know that they will be switching to a team grappling format, and will be a co-promotion with Kazushi Sakuraba\u2019s Quintet. Instead of a 16-man tournament, CJI 2 will consist of eight teams battling out for $1 million.\n\nNot much specifics outside of those have been revealed about the event, but the Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) star turned promoter in Craig Jones has been teasing more things about CJI 2 recently.\n\nCraig Jones Invitational and Karate Combat co-license The Pit\n\nLast February, Jones teased that he now owns the patent for \u201cThe Pit\u201d (or Alley) that they used for the inaugural CJI event. That fighting surface was originally created and patented by Karate Combat, and CJI has just announced that the two promotions indeed have a \u201cco-license agreement\u201d for The Pit moving forward.\n\nThe original patent is for sports surfaces with walls angled at 15 degrees or more. In a BJJ application, it has shown to produce constant action and prevent the constant resets seen in other grapplings promotions. It also helped produce what could\u2019ve just been BJJ\u2019s Griffin vs. Bonnar moment:\n\nCJI 2 set to have three \u2018Misfits\u2019 teams\n\nCJI 2 will feature several actual BJJ teams, with one member from each weight class, similar to what ADCC uses: 66 kg, 77 kg, 88 kg, 99 kg and +99kg.\n\n10th Planet\u2019s planned line up has been previously released, and Craig Jones also announced in February that four of the eight teams for CJI 2 have been officially signed. We now know the four remaining teams.\n\nLarge teams like Atos or B-Team will easily fill out their five slots, but Craig Jones has just announced that there will also be three teams comprised of \u201cMisfits.\u201d These will be filled with BJJ stars that aren\u2019t part of a massive team, and will instead be grouped together by location.\n\n\u201cWe also have three \u2018Misfit\u2019 teams,\u201d Jones announced. \u201cOne from Europe, one from Australasia, and one from The Americas. Take your pick.\u201d\n\nSeveral big names are being floated around to fill up the 15 slots on these Misfits teams. The top candidates include CJI finalist Levi Jones-Leary, Lucas Kanard, and Josh Saunders from Australia, Polaris champ Mateusz Szczecinski for Europe, and Roberto Jimenez for The Americas.\n\nBrazilian ADCC world champion teammates in Mica Galvao and \u201cBaby Shark\u201d Diogo Reis are also two big names they\u2019ll probably want in The Americas line up, should they not be part of the five major teams.\n\nDanaher\u2019s New Wave team a surprise entry to CJI 2\n\nWith the first four major BJJ teams and these three new Misfits teams, the eighth and final slot was a bit of a surprise entry: New Wave.\n\nJohn Danaher\u2019s DDS team infamously had a bitter split in 2021, which had them splintering into \u201cNew Wave\u201d with Gordon Ryan and Garry Tonon, and \u201cB-Team\u201d with Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, and Nick Rodriguez, among others.\n\nNone of John Danaher\u2019s pupils at New Wave joined the inaugural CJI event, as they all opted to stay with ADCC. Many thought they\u2019d boycott CJI 2, but things have turned around.\n\nDanaher has recently been complimentary of Craig Jones and CJI, and Jones even met with his former coach and teased how they\u2019re \u201crebuilding bridges.\u201d\n\nThose posts sparked more rumors, but it was always less likely to be about former teammates turned bitter rivals reuniting, and more about CJI business.\n\nJones has been adamant from the start that he believes he can get New Wave to be part of CJI 2, and he indeed got it done. He made the announcement on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re announcing the first team in CJI, and that team will surprise you. That is New Wave Jiu-jitsu,\u201d Jones revealed.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, while the often inactive Gordon Ryan seems unlikely to ever participate in an event promoted by Jones, New Wave will definitely still have enough members to fill a line up.\n\nRelated First Team Roster Revealed For CJI 2\n\nCJI wants UFC great Demetrious Johnson in inter-gender BJJ super-fight\n\nMMA legend Demetrious Johnson has been staying active and competing in jiu-jitsu tournaments lately, so could CJI 2 be a part of his plans?\n\nThe longtime UFC champion recently visited B-Team, where he trained (and got worked) by Craig Jones\u2019 teammates. \u201cMighty Mouse\u201d quickly shut down the idea of joining the CJI tournament, stating he knows that professional grapplers are on a different level.\n\n\u201cAs a spectator, absolutely (I\u2019ll be at CJI 2)! As for competing, no,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI only train two or three times a week, and I\u2019m more predominantly in the gi. No gi is kind of not my thing, even if I come from a no gi background.\n\n\u201cThese guys are the cream of the crop. They train every single day. All they do is no gi grappling, so I know my skill level,\u201d Mighty Mouse said.\n\nDespite this, CJI promoters still expressed interest in Johnson joining the event.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can get him a super-fight. I was thinking him and Gabi (Garcia) in the gi,\u201d CJI Executive Producer Seth Belisle said about Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019d kill it, but I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s on the fence.\u201d\n\nGabi Garcia was also in an intergender super-fight with Craig Jones at the inaugural CJI. Should the match with Johnson push through, the 6-foot-2, 10-time ADCC and IBJJF world champion would have a significant size advantage over her former flyweight UFC champion opponent.\n\nStay tuned for more CJI 2 updates.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025.\n\nThe market has been reversing its gains earlier in the year, so much so that the S&P 500 is now down 1.5% year-to-date. The past two years have seen the same index post stellar gains back-to-back, and those gains were mostly spearheaded by big-cap stocks.\n\nHowever, historically speaking, the market delivering a third year of such returns would be unprecedented. Investors believe that 2025 will likely be a year when the market starts to cool off, and recent events have started a trend toward just that.\n\nBig-cap stocks are now leading the way down as tariff and AI-related fears hurt them the most. Many big-cap companies have invested significantly in these tech trends, which investors have now soured on.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on the big-cap losers year-to-date. Many of them have declined enough to open up buying opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the worst-performing big-cap stocks year-to-date.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Danaher Corp (DHR) Is Plunging So Far in 2025?\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 101\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a diversified company that makes medical, industrial, and commercial products. It mostly focuses on life sciences and biotechnology.\n\nThe stock is down significantly so far in 2025 as Danaher missed its Q4 2024 EPS target by 5.5%. It reported $5.29 instead of the expected $5.57.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.54 billion, which was above expectations but slower than that of Danaher\u2019s peers. Analysts lowered their expectations for all of 2025 following the report and now project only 1.1% revenue growth.\n\nNot only that, Danaher itself projected a low-single-digit contraction in non-GAAP core revenue for Q1 2025 compared to the prior year period. It also faces risks in its China market.",

Significant improvements in implant technology, rising aesthetic dentistry awareness, a move away from removable to permanent dental solutions, and an increase in dental tourism are all to blame for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent technological developments, an aging world population, and growing awareness of the advantages of oral health and dental aesthetics have all contributed to the dental implant industry's notable expansion. Nowadays, dental implants are the go-to option for anyone looking for long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing replacements for lost or broken teeth.\n\nDental implants, in contrast to conventional dentures or bridges, provide long-term usefulness and durability while closely resembling the appearance and texture of natural teeth. Dental implant operations are now safer, more effective, and more accessible thanks to technological advancements including 3D imaging, computer-aided design (CAD), and minimally invasive surgical techniques. Furthermore, the durability and success rate of implants have increased with the introduction of cutting-edge biomaterials like zirconia and titanium.\n\n\n\nGrowing disposable incomes, especially in emerging economies, and a growing interest in cosmetic dentistry procedures are other factors driving the industry. The demand for dental implants has increased as people's awareness of their looks and the connection between oral health and general well-being has grown. Because dental implants are a dependable treatment for tooth loss brought on by aging, the necessity for them is further increased by the growing number of older people worldwide. Widespread adoption is still hampered by the expensive cost of implants, the requirement for qualified personnel, and the possibility of surgical complications. Notwithstanding these challenges, it is anticipated that the dental implant market would keep expanding due to continuous technological developments and a move toward long-term dental treatments.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Dental Implant Market\n\nIncreasing knowledge of aesthetic dentistry\n\n\n\nOne of the main factors driving the growth of the dental implants market is the growing popularity of cosmetic dentistry. Nowadays, patients strive for tooth replacement solutions that offer a natural-looking smile in addition to restoring oral function. According to the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD), for example, 96% of female patients in 2020 opted for cosmetic dentistry, and more than 70% of these patients were in the 31-50 age range. Because dental implants are made to mimic the color, shape, and form of natural teeth, they provide a distinct benefit in this regard. Dental implants' ability to restore both oral function and appearance has emerged as a crucial consideration for patients.\n\n\n\nMore people are choosing dental implants over more conventional options that can sacrifice aesthetic appeal as awareness of their transforming power to improve self-esteem and general well-being develops. One National Library of Medicine survey from 2022, for example, found that over 60% of dentists acknowledged receiving requests for cosmetic operations as a result of social media trends. This increased awareness of aesthetic dentistry complements the market's growth and emphasizes how important dental implants are to satisfying changing patient demands.\n\n\n\nConstant improvements in technology\n\n\n\nThe introduction of new technologies has resulted in notable advancements in the design, materials, and techniques utilized in dental implant treatments, which have improved patient outcomes and success rates. This is one of the major trends in the dental implant industry. Furthermore, the planning and placement of dental implants is being revolutionized by the incorporation of digital technology like intraoral scanners, computer-aided design or computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and 3D imaging. For example, the National Library of Medicine states that one of the cornerstones of dentistry and dental applications in the present era is the 3D imaging system. Additionally, one advancement in diagnostic imaging methods is Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Improved aesthetic results, shorter treatment periods, and more precise treatment planning are made possible by these technologies.\n\n\n\nIncreased incidence of dental conditions\n\n\n\nThe market for dental implants has seen growth due to the rising prevalence of dental conditions. Tooth decay, periodontal disease, and tooth loss are among the dental conditions that are typically prevalent in the senior population. Dental implants are becoming more and more popular as a treatment option because of the substantial impact these conditions have on people's oral health in general and their quality of life in particular. For example, according to a WHO estimate from 2023, oral disorders affect almost 3.5 billion people globally, with nearly three out of four of those affected coming from middle-income nations.\n\n\n\nIn addition to improving oral function and dental aesthetics, the extraction of teeth paves the way for long-lasting tooth alternatives for patients. An increase in the prevalence of dental illnesses influences the demand for dental implants, which is expected to rise in the future and contribute to the expansion of the dental implants market. The World Health Assembly, for example, created a worldwide oral health strategy in 2022 with the goal of ensuring that everyone has access to oral health care by 2030.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Dental Implant Market\n\nSurgical Risks and Complications\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that dental implant surgery is generally safe, some patients may be discouraged from undergoing the treatment because to its inherent dangers. Possible side effects include infection at the implant site, harm to nearby tissues or nerves, or implant failure as a result of inadequate bone integration or healing. Patients who have poor oral hygiene or underlying medical disorders may be more susceptible to these dangers.",

            "content": "At the TD Cowen Health Care Conference, Danaher president and CEO Rainer Blair discussed the future of biopharmaceutical manufacturing. \u201cFrom our perspective in bioprocessing, the recovery is in full swing. We see large customers, large [contract development and manufacturing organizations] CDMOs, really those that have commercial drugs, essentially back to normality.\u201d\n\nHe spoke glowingly about subsidiary Cytiva\u2019s success in bioprocessing and specifically about its impact in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacturing space. \u201cWhile 75% of our business today is in monoclonal antibodies and less than 10% in nucleic acid-based [therapeutics], we\u2019re able to accompany our partners throughout all of those modalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are specced in on 90% of monoclonal antibodies that are manufactured today,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also hinted at an exciting 2025 for Cytiva. \u201cWe\u2019re launching new products here in the first quarter and throughout the year. So the innovation engine is very much alive at Cytiva and driving real progress there.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for genomics and biosimilars\n\nFor Danaher to stay ahead in an industry that thrives on innovation, the firm and its subsidiaries seek to invest in newer modalities.\n\n\u201cThink monoclonal antibodies in the early 1980s, well, that\u2019s just about where we\u2019re at here with genomic medicines,\u201d Blair said. \u201cGenomic medicines are less than 10% of Danaher\u2019s sales today, but it\u2019s an exciting field. The promise of curative therapies is enormous. And the science is delivering on that promise, and we continue to expect that promise to make progress.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year during Danaher\u2019s Q4 conference call, Blair expressed excitement about the future of biosimilars, stating that their manufacture would provide a \u201ctailwind\u201d for his company.\n\nIn addressing that point, Dan Brennan, conference call participant from TD Cowen, also asked Blair about Danaher\u2019s plans for supporting biosimilar production. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a number of large patent expirations coming up over the next few years,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI know you\u2019ve also talked about maybe increasing volumes from biosimilars. Could this actually be an uplift to the growth rate of your bioprocess business?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see nothing but upside as it relates to biosimilars that are increasingly finding their way into manufacturing,\u201d Blair said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s most often the case that biosimilars are made with the same equipment and consumables in order to accelerate the path to approval [and] reduce the risk for patients and regulatory reviews. And that\u2019s really the key in that market.\u201d",

Today we are looking at Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and the best and worst performers in the research tools & consumables industry.\n\nThe life sciences subsector specializing in research tools and consumables enables scientific discoveries across academia, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. These firms supply a wide range of essential laboratory products, ensuring a recurring revenue stream through repeat purchases and replenishment. Their business models benefit from strong customer loyalty, a diversified product portfolio, and exposure to both the research and clinical markets. However, challenges include high R&D investment to maintain technological leadership, pricing pressures from budget-conscious institutions, and vulnerability to fluctuations in research funding cycles. Looking ahead, this subsector stands to benefit from tailwinds such as growing demand for tools supporting emerging fields like synthetic biology and personalized medicine. There is also a rise in automation and AI-driven solutions in laboratories that could create new opportunities to sell tools and consumables. Nevertheless, headwinds exist. These companies tend to be at the mercy of supply chain disruptions and sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions that impact funding for research initiatives.\n\nThe 10 research tools & consumables stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.3% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nAmidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 12.5% since the latest earnings results.\n\nDanaher (NYSE:DHR)\n\nStarted as a real estate investment trust, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) designs and manufactures professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services.\n\nDanaher reported revenues of $6.54 billion, up 2.1% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.6%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates.\n\nRainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We finished the year strong, with better-than-anticipated core revenue in all three of our segments. Good execution by our team also drove solid cash flow and operating margin expansion.\"\n\nDanaher Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 17.3% since reporting and currently trades at $205.15.\n\nIs now the time to buy Danaher?

            "content": "MarketsandMarkets Research Pvt. Ltd.\n\nDelray Beach, FL, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global microbiological testing of water market is projected to grow significantly, reaching an estimated $2.3 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%. The rising consumer awareness regarding the importance of safe and nutritious water, coupled with the increasing demand for bacteria- and chemical-free water, are key factors driving this market expansion.\n\nKey Market Drivers\n\nIncreasing Need for Water Quality Analysis\n\nThe demand for microbiological testing of water is on the rise due to growing microbial contamination across various water bodies. Industrial sectors such as oil & gas, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, chemical, and food & beverage are increasingly adopting microbiological water testing solutions.\n\nA significant portion of the global population relies on private water supplies, including wells, dugouts, and ponds, making high-quality water a crucial factor for economic, physical, and social well-being. Government agencies and research institutions remain major consumers of microbial water analytical instruments to ensure public health and safety. Regular water quality testing and monitoring help eliminate potential health hazards associated with contaminated water sources.\n\nGet Custom Data to Solve Your Business Challenges\n\nNorth America Leading the Market\n\nNorth America is anticipated to hold the largest market share during the forecast period. The region has witnessed multiple waterborne disease outbreaks, including cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, caused by protozoan contamination.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), microbial waterborne diseases affect developed countries such as the United States, where an estimated 560,000 individuals suffer from severe waterborne diseases annually, while 7.1 million experience mild to moderate infections, resulting in approximately 12,000 deaths per year.\n\nMicrobial contaminations in water sources are exacerbated by heavy rainfall, flooding, and inadequate water treatment processes. This drives the need for advanced microbiological water testing solutions in North America to ensure safe water supplies.\n\nOpportunities in Emerging Economies\n\nThe microbiological testing of water market is expected to experience rapid growth in emerging economies, particularly in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America. These regions remain largely untapped markets for microbiological water testing solution providers and present enormous growth opportunities.",

These are companies that I see as having clear scope to increase their sales and profits for a long time.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in the idea that valuation is important \u2013 even when it comes to growth stocks. And these are shares that are trading at some of their lowest multiples for years.\n\nDanaher\n\nDanaher (NYSE:DHR) is a great example. The company is a collection of smaller businesses that supply tools and technologies in the life sciences and diagnostics industries.\n\nThe firm\u2019s growth strategy involves acquiring other organisations that operate in markets close to its own. From there it looks to integrate them into its existing structure.\n\nThis results in cost savings, operational efficiencies, and improved performance \u2013 which translates into higher profits. And this has been an extremely effective approach.\n\nOver the last 10 years, revenues have gone from $14.4bn to $23.9bn. While there has been some volatility during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, overall growth has been strong.\n\nAcquiring other businesses is a risky approach. Danaher has recently paid a high multiple to acquire a company called ABCAM \u2013 and this increases the chances of overpaying.\n\nEliminating this risk is impossible, but investors can mitigate it by avoiding overpaying for the stock. And at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of just below 3 \u2014 its lowest level since 2019 \u2014 I think now is a good time to be looking.\n\nJudges Scientific\n\nJudges Scientific (LSE:JDG) has a lot in common with Danaher. It\u2019s another firm that looks to grow by acquisitions and focuses on scientific equipment, albeit with a broader range of uses.\n\nThe stock has fallen 23% over the last 12 months, as sales have slowed. But I think this is temporary and puts the stock in very interesting territory.\n\nUnlike Danaher, Judges Scientific doesn\u2019t typically look to involve itself in the businesses it acquires. It mostly allows them to continue to operate as they were.\n\nThis increases the risk of overpaying, since cost savings aren\u2019t there to be made. But there is a positive element to the company\u2019s approach as well.\n\nJudges Scientific allows managers to keep running their operations. And this can be valuable for entrepreneurs who want to be able to continue to direct the businesses they have built.\n\nThe stock is trading at a P/B multiple of 6, which is high compared to other shares, but low in the context of where the stock has been in the last five years. As a result, I think it\u2019s well worth taking a look at in March.\n\nPrice-to-book!?\n\nI\u2019ve used price-to-book instead of price-to-earnings (P/E) as a valuation basis. This is because one-off and intangible costs make Danaher and Judges Scientific tricky in terms of earnings.",

            "content": "What Academy Awards did The Quiet Man\" win? Were Maureen O'Hara, John Wayne, and John Ford recognized with Oscars?\n\n\"The Quiet Man\", the 1952 John Ford film that starred Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne and memorably brought Ireland to the big screen in technicolor, is recognized today as a beloved classic film.\n\nBut how was \"The Quiet Man\" received when it was first released? What awards did it win?\n\n\"The Quiet Man\" tells the story of Sean Thornton (Wayne), an Irish-born boxer raised in America who returns to Ireland, to his hometown of Innisfree for some peace and solace after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring. There, he meets the beautiful and fierce Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara) and butts heads with her brother, Will (Victor McLaglen,) over his ancestral homestead, owned by the Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Thornton bonds quickly with the Innisfree locals, especially Mary Kate, who refuses to marry him until he can retrieve her dowry from Will.\n\nCritics responded very positively to the film and audiences were awed by the beauty of the Irish landscape. When awards season rolled around, \"The Quiet Man\" was nominated for seven Academy Awards: Best Picture (John Ford and Merian C. Cooper), Best Director (John Ford), Best Cinematography (Winton C. Hoch and Artie Stout), Best Adapted Screenplay (Frank S. Nugent), Best Supporting Actor (Victor McLaglen), Best Art Direction (Frank Hotaling, John McCarthy, Jr., and Charles S. Thompson), and Best Sound (Daniel J. Bloomberg, Republic Sound Department).\n\nFor the 25th Academy Awards, \"The Quiet Man\" tied with \"Moulin Rouge\" and \"High Noon\" for the most nominations, each of the films going up for the Oscar in seven categories. However, with \"The Quiet Man\", fans were shocked that only Victor McLaglen received a nomination for his acting; John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's stellar work as Sean Thornton and Mary Kate Danaher was not recognized by the Academy.\n\nThe awards ceremony held on March 19, 1953, in both Hollywood and New York, was the first Academy Awards to be televised. The Quiet Man\" wound up winning two Oscars: John Ford won for Best Director, and Winton Hoch and Artie Stout won for Best Cinematography. It was John Ford's fourth time winning the Oscar for Best Director, a record that stands to his day.\n\nThe Quiet Man\" lost Best Picture to Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth, and Victor McLaglen lost the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Anthony Quinn in \"Viva Zapata!\"\n\nJohn Wayne would finally win his Best Actor Oscar for \"True Grit\" in 1969. But Maureen O'Hara, despite her nickname as the Queen of Technicolor, was never nominated for a single Oscar. To rectify this, in 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrated O'Hara's contribution to Hollywood with an honorary Oscar at the grand age of 94.\n\nDo you think The Quiet Man should have won more Oscars?

            "content": "Dublin, Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"China Dental Market Forecast Report by Segment, Equipment, Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nChina Dental market is expected to reach US$ 13.95 billion by 2033 from US$ 7.68 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 6.86 % from 2025 to 2033\n\nAn aging population, growing access to dental treatment, rising disposable incomes, and growing awareness of oral health are the main factors driving the Chinese dentistry market. Growth is also fueled by developments in dental technology, a developing middle class, government healthcare reforms, and trends in cosmetic dentistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing middle class, rising disposable income, and growing awareness of oral health have all contributed to the recent notable expansion of the Chinese dentistry sector. The demand for dental treatments, such as cosmetic dentistry, restorative operations, and preventative care, is rising as people become more health conscious. Another significant factor is the nation's aging population, as problems like tooth loss and periodontal disorders frequently necessitate dental care for senior citizens.\n\nFurthermore, the sector is expanding as a result of improvements in treatment quality and efficiency brought about by developments in dental technology, including as digital imaging, 3D printing, and laser dentistry. The development of dental treatment in both urban and rural areas has been made possible by the government's efforts to increase access to healthcare.\n\n\n\nProcedures including veneers, orthodontics, and tooth whitening are becoming more and more common in cosmetic dentistry, particularly among younger people. Additionally, dental tourism is growing in popularity as more international patients travel to China in search of reasonably priced, superior dental care. Additionally, local dentists and global dental chains are investing in cutting-edge facilities, which will accelerate market growth. The dentistry industry is expected to increase even if there are still issues including the unequal distribution of resources and the need for more qualified workers. It is anticipated that the Chinese government's backing of dental insurance plans and oral health initiatives would further fortify the sector and increase access to dental treatment for a larger population.\n\n\n\nBy 2030, the Healthy China 2030 Plan aims to reduce dental caries among 12-year-old children in urban areas by an extra 10 to 25 percent, promote better oral hygiene, and increase knowledge of oral health. There are early indications that these efforts are effective. According to the Fourth National Oral Health Survey, 84.9 percent of people have a good attitude toward oral health, and 60.1% are aware of the importance of oral care.\n\n\n\nRising Dental Awareness\n\n\n\nThe expanding dentistry market in China is mostly driven by rising dental awareness. The need for routine dental exams and preventative treatment has grown as more people realize how important oral hygiene and health are. Media attention and educational initiatives have helped raise awareness of the connection between dental health and general wellbeing.\n\nFurthermore, early detection and treatment have been promoted by increased knowledge of common dental issues such cavities, gum disease, and tooth decay. More people are using dental services, such as regular cleanings, examinations, and preventive measures like fluoride treatments, as a result of this mentality change. Consumers are seeking professional dental care more frequently as public awareness of the issue grows, which is propelling the growth of dental clinics, technologies, and services nationwide.\n\n\n\nRising Disposable Incomes\n\n\n\nThe growing middle class in China is contributing significantly to the country's rising disposable earnings, which in turn is propelling the dentistry market's expansion. Dental care, which was previously regarded as a luxury by many, is becoming more and more affordable as more individuals enjoy better economic circumstances. The demand for more sophisticated services like dental implants and cosmetic operations like veneers and teeth whitening has increased along with the demand for preventive care like regular checkups and cleanings.\n\nA movement in consumer behavior toward higher-quality dental care is partly a result of consumers' increased ability to prioritize oral health as part of their overall wellness due to rising prosperity. It is anticipated that access to professional dental care will increase as disposable incomes rise, further boosting market demand.\n\n\n\nTechnological Advancements\n\n\n\nThe expansion of the Chinese dental market is being mostly driven by technological developments in the field. The accuracy, effectiveness, and patient experience of treatments have increased with the use of cutting-edge technologies including digital imaging, 3D printing, and laser dentistry. While 3D printing makes it possible to precisely create dental implants, crowns, and orthodontic devices, digital imaging offers crisper, more detailed images that facilitate quicker diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\nLaser dentistry is becoming more and more popular for procedures including gum reshaping, cavity treatment, and tooth whitening since it reduces pain and recovery time. These developments raise demand for contemporary dental services by improving overall patient happiness, cutting down on treatment times, and improving the quality of dental care. With the ongoing advancement of technology, innovative dental procedures will become even more accessible and appealing in China.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the China Dental Market\n\nUneven Distribution of Dental Services\n\n\n\nOne major issue facing the Chinese dentistry market is the uneven distribution of dental services. Rural areas have limited access to high-quality dental care, but large cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou enjoy the advantages of sophisticated dental care facilities and a high concentration of dental experts. Factors including inadequate healthcare infrastructure, a shortage of qualified dental experts, and a lack of consumer awareness in rural areas are the main causes of this geographic difference.\n\nBecause of this, a sizable section of the populace in these locations continues to receive inadequate dental treatment, which results in unmet needs. In remote areas, oral health problems may worsen due to limited availability to preventive care and specialist procedures. Resolving these geographical discrepancies and increasing access to healthcare in underprivileged areas are essential if China's dentistry market is to reach its full potential.\n\n\n\nCompetition from International Players\n\n\n\nIn China, local dentists are facing an increasing amount of competition from foreign firms. Foreign dental chains and manufacturers are becoming more and more present in the market as it attracts interest from around the world. They bring with them cutting-edge technologies, better service standards, and competitive pricing. Local dental practices are seriously threatened by these foreign competitors, who frequently have well-established brands and a wealth of knowledge.\n\nDomestic suppliers are under pressure to constantly innovate, implement cutting-edge dental technologies, and improve service quality in order to preserve market share. Local businesses are often compelled by the competition to set themselves apart through unique products or pricing schemes. Because of this, the Chinese dentistry market is getting more and more competitive, and both domestic and foreign businesses must adjust to the changing conditions.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese dental sector has seen a rise in the use of preventive dentistry\n\n\n\nThe preventive dentistry section is increasing in the market, reflecting a shift to proactive healthcare practices. Growing recognition of oral health and hygiene drives individuals to seek proactive measures to prevent dental troubles. Government projects promoting dental fitness training and preventive care further encourage this trend. Also, the growing occurrence of dental illnesses underscores the significance of preventive measures to maintain oral fitness. Moreover, advancements in preventive dental technology and treatments cause them to be accessible and lower priced to the population.\n\n\n\nIn China, radiology equipment plays a big role in the dentistry business\n\n\n\nRadiology equipment is awaited to grow in the China dental market due to its critical position in analysis and remedy planning. Demand for precise imaging solutions escalates with a developing emphasis on advanced dental care and the increasing popularity of dental fitness. Radiology device, which includes X-ray machines and CBCT scanners, helps accurate analysis of dental conditions, leading to higher remedy consequences. Moreover, technological upgrades and government tasks selling healthcare infrastructure improvement propel the adoption of radiology equipment inside the China dental market.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 88 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $7.68 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $13.95 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 6.8% Regions Covered China\n\n\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments, Revenue Analysis\n\nSirona Dental Systems Foshan Co.,\n\nDanaher\n\n3M Co\n\nStraumann\n\nZimmer Biomet\n\nPhillips\n\nColgate Palmolive\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBourgeon Capital Management LLC is an investment advisory firm headquartered in Darien, Connecticut. Founded in 1999 by seasoned financial professional John Aniblo Zaro, the firm specializes in actively managed, separate accounts with investment portfolios consisting primarily of stocks and bonds. In 2002, Bourgeon Capital expanded its leadership team when Michael Keohane joined SAC Capital to co-manage the firm\u2019s long/short hedge fund. With a portfolio value of nearly $535.55 million by the end of December 2024, Bourgeon Capital is known for providing personalized investment strategies designed to manage risk while achieving long-term growth.\n\nJohn Zaro, the firm\u2019s founder and managing partner, has an extensive background in investment management spanning several decades. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Economics from Stanford University, he is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and an active member of the New York Society of Security Analysts.\n\nJohn Zaro\u2019s career in finance has been marked by influential roles at major financial institutions; it began at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC where he held the role of vice president from 1984 to 1991. Later, he served as a portfolio manager and vice president at J.P. Morgan Investment Management from 1991 to 1997 during which he managed substantial assets for clients. Just before establishing Bourgeon Capital, Zaro held the positions of Chief Investment Officer and Managing Director at Warburg Pincus Asset Management from 1997 to 1999. During his time there, he played a key role in shaping investment strategies for high-net-worth clients. With expertise in portfolio and alpha target management, Zaro was instrumental in refining investment processes for private clients and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nWith over two decades of experience, Zaro founded Bourgeon Capital with the vision of offering a more client-centric approach to wealth management. His goal has always been to foster strong, long-term relationships with clients through honest and strategic financial guidance. Bourgeon Capital continues to uphold this commitment, ensuring that each client\u2019s investment strategy is tailored to their unique financial needs and aspirations.\n\nIn recognition of his accomplishments in wealth management, Morgan Stanley announced in 2022 that Zaro, then serving as a First Vice President and Financial Advisor at the firm\u2019s Wealth Management office, was named to Forbes Magazine\u2019s prestigious list of Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors. This ranking evaluates candidates based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including industry experience, leadership experience, assets under management, revenue trends, and compliance records. The selection process also incorporates insights gained from extensive interviews.\n\nBourgeon Capital\u2019s investment philosophy is centered on achieving consistent, long-term returns while minimizing volatility. The firm prioritizes risk management by employing strategies that aim to reduce extreme market fluctuations. A key approach under Zaro\u2019s leadership has been investing excess cash in the bond market to capitalize on higher interest rates.

            "content": "In a shareholder-friendly move, Danaher Corporation DHR has announced a hike in its dividend payout. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 18.5% to 32 cents per share (annually: $1.28). The new dividend will be paid out on April 25, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 28, 2025.\n\n\n\nThe move underscores DHR\u2019s sound financial health as it utilizes free cash flow to enhance its shareholders\u2019 returns. Prior to this, Danaher had hiked its dividend by 8% to 27 cents per share in February 2024.\n\n\n\nStrong cash flows allow Danaher to effectively deploy capital for making acquisitions, repurchasing shares and paying out dividends. The company\u2019s adjusted free cash flow totaled $5.3 billion in 2024, reflecting an increase of 3.5% year over year. Dividend payments totaled $768 million in 2024 and $821 million in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe company also bought back 28 million of its common stock for $7 billion in 2024.

            "content": "Last week saw the newest annual earnings release from Danaher Corporation ( ), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$24b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 5.5% to hit US$5.29 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, Danaher's 26 analysts currently expect revenues in 2025 to be US$24.1b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 5.3% to US$5.74. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$24.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.69 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nThere were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$267, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Danaher at US$310 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$240. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Danaher's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 1.1% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 3.1% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 6.0% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Danaher.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Danaher's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$267, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Danaher. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for Danaher going out to 2027, and you can\n\nYou should always think about risks though.

This in-depth analysis shows that the Global Industrial Laser Marking Machine Market, valued at USD 3.18 Billion in 2023, is set for substantial growth and is projected to reach USD 6.41 Billion by 2032. This anticipated expansion reflects a strong CAGR of 8.1% from 2024 to 2032.\n\nThe industrial laser marking machine market is driven by demand for high-precision, permanent marking in manufacturing, automotive, electronics, and aerospace. Advancements in fiber, CO\u2082, and UV lasers enhance efficiency. Growth is fueled by automation, traceability regulations, and rising industrialization, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.\n\nDownload Sample 250 Pages Of Oilfield Drilling Elevator Market Report@ https://imrmarketreports.com/request/9353\n\nKey Industry Insights \u2013\n\nRise of Automation and Industry 4.0: The increasing adoption of automation and Industry 4.0 in manufacturing is significantly driving the demand for industrial laser marking machines. These machines offer high-speed, precise, and permanent marking solutions, which are essential for traceability, quality control, and compliance with global regulations in industries such as automotive, aerospace, electronics, and medical devices. As manufacturers focus on improving production efficiency and integrating smart technologies, laser marking systems are becoming a preferred choice due to their ability to operate seamlessly with automated assembly lines, robotics, and IoT-based monitoring systems, enhancing overall productivity.\n\nHigh Initial Investment and Maintenance Costs: Despite their advantages, the widespread adoption of industrial laser marking machines is hindered by their high initial purchase cost and maintenance expenses. Advanced laser systems, especially fiber and UV lasers, require a significant upfront investment, making them less accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, periodic maintenance, component replacements, and the need for skilled operators add to the total cost of ownership. Many companies, particularly those operating on tight budgets, may opt for alternative marking methods like inkjet printing or dot peen marking, which require lower capital expenditure, limiting market penetration.\n\nGrowing Demand for Eco-Friendly Marking Solutions: With increasing emphasis on sustainability and environmental regulations, the demand for eco-friendly, non-contact marking solutions is on the rise, creating significant opportunities for industrial laser marking machines. Unlike traditional marking methods that rely on consumables such as inks, chemicals, or engraving tools, laser marking systems provide a cleaner, more sustainable solution with minimal waste and reduced operational costs. Industries focusing on green manufacturing and regulatory compliance are actively adopting laser marking technology to reduce their environmental footprint while maintaining high-quality, permanent markings for product identification and traceability.\n\n\"Research made simple and affordable \u2013 Trusted Research Tailored just for you \u2013 IMR Knowledge Cluster\"\n\nhttps://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/\n\nCompetition from Alternative Marking Technologies: The industrial laser marking machine market faces challenges from alternative marking technologies, such as inkjet printing, dot peen marking, and electrochemical etching, which offer cost-effective solutions for various applications. While laser marking provides superior precision and durability, these alternative methods are often preferred in industries where high-speed, low-cost, and flexible marking solutions are required. Moreover, advancements in ink formulations, deep marking capabilities, and improved dot peen technology are making these alternatives more competitive, particularly in price-sensitive markets, posing a challenge to the widespread adoption of laser marking machines.\n\nKey Players to Watch:\n\nCoherent, Inc.

            "content": "Though not as safe a bet as safe-haven assets like precious metals, value stocks are nonetheless an enticing option for investors when the market gets bumpy. An undervalued company that has excellent fundamentals but a less-than-stellar recent stock performance history is often better positioned to benefit during periods of volatility than growth names with less of a track record of success.\n\nLife sciences and diagnostics firm Danaher Corp. (NYSE: DHR) is well established across multiple industries, giving it numerous pathways to growth, while sell-side advertising platform Magnite Inc. (NASDAQ: MGNI) similarly has access to many media properties and channels, insulating it from issues affecting any of these areas individually. Finally, Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE: DBD) provides banking and retail solutions to a host of clients. All three of these firms have various value metrics flashing and may be good candidates for value investors looking to buy and hold names this year.\n\nWhy Danaher's Dip Is a Buying Opportunity\n\n[content-module:CompanyOverview|NYSE:DHR]\n\nDanaher shares have fallen about 16% in the last year as of February 20, 2025, although they were actually up until mid-October before falling about 23% since that time. Most recently, the stock fell in January after a rare disappointing earnings report. The drop in price has brought Danaher to a forward P/E ratio of 2.6, making it stand out as a potential value buy.\n\nHowever, a low P/E ratio is only helpful to investors if a company is likely to improve its share price in the future, and fortunately, Danaher offers numerous reasons for optimism. For one thing, despite tepid 2% year-over-year revenue growth for the latest quarter, the company's free cash flow of $5.3 billion remains very strong. Likewise, its operating margins for both its biotechnology and life sciences businesses increased year-over-year, signaling improving efficiency.\n\nDanaher has also engaged in an aggressive share buyback campaign, noting in its full-year 2024 financials that it paid nearly $6 billion last year in payments for repurchase of common shares. Together with its recently announced investment in Innovaccer, a healthcare AI firm, it appears the company is executing a long-term strategy to boost its value proposition. Investors willing to be patient may find that the recent dip presents a solid opportunity to buy.\n\nDespite Rally, Magnite Appears to Be a Good Deal\n\n[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MGNI]\n\nIn contrast to Danaher's stock price stumbles in recent months, Magnite shares have far outpaced the market in the last year, climbing by almost 85% in the 12-month period to February 20, 2025. Still, it appears that the stock may still have room to grow based on a relatively modest P/S ratio of just over 4. Further, analysts are broadly optimistic about Magnite shares, with 12 out of 13 rating it a Buy.\n\nAll of these ratings pre-date Magnite's recent confirmation that it has entered a partnership with the social media platform X, which has struggled with advertisers since Elon Musk's 2022 purchase of the platform, then known as Twitter. Magnite's involvement should help X advertisers better cater their ad buys. This could be especially important as Musk has signaled his intent to make the platform an \"everything app,\" including plans to launch a real-time payments service in partnership with Visa Inc. (NYSE: V).\n\nMissed Earnings Don't Hold Diebold Back\n\n[content-module:CompanyOverview|NYSE:DBD]\n\nIn its February 2025 earnings report, Diebold Nixdorf missed EPS estimates by 25 cents per share. However, investors didn't blink; shares remain up almost 29% in the last year as of February 20. This may be due to the company's strong value signs\u2014its P/S ratio is just 0.5\u2014and to the firm's impressive $452 million in adjusted EBITDA, above the high end of guidance.\n\nDiebold also generated $109 million in free cash flow last quarter, the strongest quarterly performance in this area since the current iteration of the company was constituted almost a decade ago. This allows the firm flexibility to repurchase up to $100 million in stock, even as it reduced its overall debt load by some $338 million in the last year.\n\nTo be sure, Diebold faces challenges in 2025. The self-checkout tech space is crowded and the company has had a difficult time achieving market share. Retail business, in general, continues to face headwinds due to lingering inflation and other concerns. Further, unfavorable currency conditions could negatively impact revenues as well. Still, despite these challenges, Diebold presents a compelling case for investors looking to buy and hold.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"3 Stocks Offering Strong Value and Stability\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

            "content": "HARTFORD \u2014 Voters will elect candidates to four Selectboard seats at this year\u2019s Town Meeting, with three of those contested.\n\nAshley Andreas and Patrick Danaher both hope to complete the final year of Sue Buckholz\u2019 two-year term. Buckholz, elected last March, resigned from the board in October. The board decided to leave her seat vacant until Town Meeting.\n\nIncumbent Lannie Collins and newcomers Miranda Dupre and Erik Krauss are competing for two three-year terms.\n\nIncumbent Mary Erdei, 74, who has served on the board since 2022, is running uncontested for a two-year seat.\n\nThe successful candidates will join board Chairman Mike Hoyt and board members Ida Griesemer and Brandon Smith. Kim Souza, who joined the board in 2018, is not running for reelection.\n\nOne-year term\n\nFor Andreas, 37, the one-year term is an opportunity to get a sense of the level of commitment involved in serving on the Selectboard.\n\nWith a background working as a home ownership advisor, Andreas wants to explore ways that the Selectboard can encourage new development of affordable housing geared toward local families and employees, she said by phone recently.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re up against a lot of challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are stressed and scared about the economic circumstances that we are surviving through.\u201d\n\nArticle continues after... Yesterday's Most Read Articles\n\nThe Hartford Village resident, who moved to Quechee when she was 18, hopes to encourage grassroots efforts to protect and support vulnerable community members in Hartford.\n\nShe would bring good communication, empathy and understanding of different points of view to the board, she said. \u201cI\u2019d really love to foster a network of volunteerism and connectedness within the town.\u201d\n\nThis race marks Danaher\u2019s third attempt to win a Selectboard seat. A 67-year-old graduate of Hartford High School and the University of Vermont, he served as a Capitol Hill intern for the late Sen. Jim Jeffords \u2014 a Vermont Republican who became an independent.\n\nAfter pursuing a sailing career out of state for several decades, he returned to Hartford in 2020 to care for his mother. He became engaged in local politics, attending Selectboard meetings and serving on Hartford\u2019s Committee on Housing and Homelessness.\n\n\u201cOne of my main focuses is affordability,\u201d he said by phone recently.\n\nHe wants to trim expenditures so that the town can live within its means, he said. \u201cThe way things are going I think the town has gotten unaffordable for the middle class. Hopefully, I can join the board and try to keep taxes down,\u201d he said.\n\nThree-year terms\n\nIncumbent Lannie Collins, 57, of Quechee has been a member of the Selectboard since 2021. He is a fourth-generation Hartford resident who has served in the Vermont Army National Guard and on the Hartford Fire Department.\n\nCollins wants to focus more on the administration of the town and \u201cless on divisive politics that are not within the review of the Selectboard,\u201d he said by email last week.\n\nHis priorities include promoting accountability, transparency and frugal spending, he said. Collins also wants to ensure that \u201call voices are heard and acknowledged,\u201d and to welcome differences of opinion \u201cwith civility and openness to listen and learn from each other within our town.\u201d\n\nHe stands on his record as a board member.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that every decision that I have made has been for the best interest of the Town of Hartford voters and this will continue if reelected,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMiranda Dupre, 29, of White River Junction, is a community navigator for Vital Communities, helping to advance home and business ownership among people of color in the Upper Valley.\n\nHer focus as a Selectboard member would be on building a stronger sense of community among Hartford residents. \u201cIt\u2019s there, but it isn\u2019t always translating,\u201d she said by phone recently.\n\n\u201cHartford is really amazing, and the base values are welcoming and inclusive,\u201d she said. But that isn\u2019t always evident in people\u2019s everyday language and behavior.\n\n\u201cDiscussions of \u2018being a Vermonter\u2019 and calling people \u2018flatlanders,\u2019 \u201d she said, \u201care little things that can make people feel that they are not part of the community.\u201d\n\nHelping people connect on a more personal level, she said, creates a space \u201cwhere you can actually come up with solutions together even when you disagree on how get there.\u201d\n\nHartford resident Erik Krauss, 55, recently retired from a career in software systems integration. He has served on the town\u2019s Energy Commission and the Climate Advisory Committee.\n\n\u201cI want to come onto the board and be productive and not disruptive,\u201d he said by phone recently.\n\nThe town has made some progress in the last few years in terms of stability in leadership roles, he said.\n\n\u201cI want to see what I can bring in terms of continuous improvement and creative problem-solving,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the longer term, he wants to focus on initiatives that include transportation improvements. It is an issue that touches on other priorities such as \u201caffordability, parking, and greenhouse gas emissions. We can mitigate these challenges with transportation,\u201d he said.\n\nHartford resident and former Selectboard member Ally Tufenkjian has created a Hartford voter guide, which is available at: hartfordvoterguide.wixsite.com/candidates.\n\nHartford\u2019s town and school meeting is scheduled for Saturday, March 1 at 10 a.m. in the High School gymnasium.\n\nBallot voting will take place on Tuesday, March 4 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the high school gymnasium.\n\nChristina Dolan can be reached at cdolan@vnews.com or 603-727-3208.",

For a company making \u20ac800 million in profits annually, this was outrageous,\u201d he said.\n\nCouncillor Joe Kileen (FF) proposed the ESB and broadband providers should be able to calculate how long a person was without power and pay compensation based on that.\n\nCouncillors Pat Daly (FF), Michael Begley (Ind) and Michael Shannon requested the Government to provide grant aid to purchase affordable generators so they can cope with difficult circumstances in any future storms.\n\nDescribing Storm \u00c9owyn as one of the worst storms ever to hit the country, Councillor Pat Daly said it caused enormous hardship to communities, leaving more than one million people without power.\n\n\u201cMost new houses depend on electricity and people had no power, broadband, water or mobile phone. People were left totally in darkness, it was so frustrating,\u201d he said.\n\nCouncillor Begley said the works to enable a generator connect to the cabling in a house should be included in any grant aid scheme. In rural areas, Councillor Shannon said a back up was needed as people can\u2019t be left without power for 12 days again.\n\n\u201cThere should be a supply of generators throughout the county to ensure water is kept running and mobile communications continues to work,\u201d he said.\n\nCouncillor Tommy Guilfoyle (SF) suggested once a changeover switch is installed for vulnerable people and those using medical devices, a generator should kick in once there is a power blackout.\n\nCouncillor Griffin said the HSE should be mandated to have a plan in place for vulnerable people when they lose power, particularly those on home dialysis and using oxygen tanks.\n\nCouncillor Hayes suggested the ESB should be invited to a meeting to clarify how the agency can prioritise vulnerable people with medical needs once they have no electricity.\n\nCouncillor Pat O\u2019Gorman (FF) proposed the council should engage with farmer representative organisations and agricultural contractors to investigate the potential for cooperation in dealing with the fallout from storm damage.\n\nThe Cratloe councillor recalled farmers throughout the county had used their machinery and chain saws to clear roads.",

The associated price target remains the same with $265.00.\n\nMichael Ryskin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors concerning Danaher\u2019s recent developments. One significant reason is Danaher\u2019s announcement of a new cost savings initiative expected to generate at least $150 million in annual pre-tax savings by 2025. This initiative is anticipated to improve productivity and reduce costs across various segments, including areas under pressure such as China and the Diagnostics sector. This strategic move is projected to provide a considerable boost to the company\u2019s margins and earnings per share, reinforcing the financial outlook for Danaher.\n\nAdditionally, Ryskin\u2019s confidence in Danaher\u2019s management\u2019s ability to navigate and counteract various unexpected challenges further justifies the Buy rating. Despite facing potential headwinds such as changes in China\u2019s procurement policies and foreign exchange fluctuations, Danaher\u2019s strategy and execution are seen as solid and promising. This, combined with their capability to exceed initial financial guidance, positions the company well for future growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity as reflected by the Buy rating.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Ryskin is a 3-star analyst with an average return of 1.0% and a 46.83% success rate. Ryskin covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Danaher, Agilent, and Bruker.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "William Blair analyst Matt Larew has maintained their bullish stance on DHR stock, giving a Buy rating on February 13.\n\nMatt Larew has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors regarding Danaher\u2019s financial outlook. The company has announced a significant cost-saving initiative aimed at achieving at least $150 million in annual pretax savings by 2025. These savings are expected to be incremental, providing an upside to the company\u2019s previously issued guidance and potentially adding $0.17 to the 2025 EPS estimate, resulting in an updated forecast of $7.79 per share.\n\nDespite recent pressure on Danaher\u2019s stock, stemming from a weaker EPS guidance compared to peers, this proactive cost management and potential share repurchase activities could align EPS growth more closely with industry averages. The announced plan underscores management\u2019s commitment to aligning expenses with growth expectations, which, along with an improving environment in the bioprocessing and life sciences sectors, suggests potential for stock appreciation. Furthermore, Danaher\u2019s current trading multiple, while in line with peers, is at a discount to its historical average, indicating potential for valuation growth as cost-saving measures take effect.\n\nIn another report released on February 13, Bank of America Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $265.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

None of the grapplers at New Wave Jiu-Jitsu that Danaher coaches actually competed at the event, but he is famous for watching hours of match footage so it\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s seen it. The inaugural Craig Jones Invitational was a huge success and it involved several elite competitors that will likely be future opponents for his students too. He has likely watched it as both a fan of the sport, and as a diligent coach with one eye in the future.\n\nHe revealed what he thought about the event during a recent conversation with Jake Shields on his podcast, and his assessment was incredibly positive:\n\n\u201cThat was a fantastic show. They did an incredible job\u2026 Not only did they do an incredible show, they did an incredible job against all the odds. The show wasn\u2019t even conceived until a relatively short time before it was put in place.\u201d\n\nAlthough John Danaher wasn\u2019t physically present at the first edition of the Craig Jones Invitational, Jones himself is confident that New Wave will be fielding a team in the second edition. Although nothing official has come from Danaher or any of his students just yet, there really is nothing to stand in their way now that there\u2019s no direct conflict with ADCC. The positive review from Danaher also adds some weight to the idea of his team competing, and he made a great point that Jones put it all together in very little time:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do a lot of work, you\u2019ve got to get a lot of little bureaucratic things done. And to put on an international-level show, I think they had like three or four months to get it ready, it\u2019s not long at all. And to get it that good on the first attempt, it was impressive.\u201d\n\nThe full interview with John Danaher where he shares his thoughts on the inaugural Craig Jones Invitational was uploaded to the official YouTube channel of Jake Shields\u2019 Fight Backpodcast:",

            "content": "Share All sharing options for: John Danaher could \u2018step away from coaching\u2019 Gordon Ryan, other pro athletes - BJJ Beat\n\nWelcome to the BJJ Beat! On this recurring feature, we\u2019ll tackle the biggest news from the professional grappling scene, and roll everything up in an easily digestible and familiar jiu-jitsu format.\n\nWarm Ups\n\nTop BJJ coach John Danaher could \u2018step away from coaching\u2019 after multiple surgeries\n\nJohn Danaher, who is perhaps the most famous BJJ coach today, says he will have to seriously consider his current role. He has coached jiu-jitsu champions like Gordon Ryan, Giancarlo Bodoni, Nicholas Meregali, and Helena Crevar at New Wave, but \u201ccould step away from coaching professional athletes\u201d altogether.\n\nDanaher says this is due to him needing four surgeries, including hip and knee replacements. According to the New Wave coach, doctors tell him that these serious surgeries could not only sideline him from jiu-jitsu, but also signal \u201cthe end of any kind of jiu-jitsu type movement at a high level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year I will have to do four surgeries to try and get a satisfactory body back,\u201d Danaher wrote on Instagram. \u201cI started today with the easiest surgery - a bilateral inguinal hernia repair that I\u2019ve been putting off too long. Then I will have to schedule the much more serious hip and knee replacements (after that I have to get lens implanted my eyes to get my deteriorating vision back in order).\n\n\u201cMy last hip replacement took about six months to a year to fully recover from. The issue will be the more complex and generally less robust knee replacement, which in my case will be attached to a femur that already has a hip replacement on the other side of it. The doctors say that generally this is the end of any kind of Jiu jitsu type movement at high level,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAs such I will most likely have to make a reappraisal of my role in Jiu jitsu coaching. I hope that given enough time I can return to high level coaching but it may be that I have to switch focus to more recreational Jiu jitsu coaching. Despite the uncertainty, there is something of which I am very sure. If I do have to step away from coaching professional athletes, my students are without exception, truly outstanding teachers so I am extremely confident that they can represent what we espoused far better than I ever did and contribute greatly to the sports continued growth.\u201d\n\nDrills\n\nStacked UFC FPI 10 fight card gets three more bouts\n\nThe UFC Fight Pass Invitational 10 (UFC FPI 10) line up is shaping up nicely. After staging a bit of a coup and getting one of the best matches possible in BJJ today as the headliner, the rest of the card has been filling up.\n\nAs recently reported, CJI champion Nick Rodriguez will co-headline the bout in a tough rematch with five time IBJJF world champion Victor Hugo.\n\nThree more excellent matches were also confirmed. BJJ legend Andre Galvao\u2019s daughter, Sarah Galvao will continue her pro grappling career against the youngest ever black belt world champion in Cassia Moura. Ronaldo Junior, fresh off his win over Jay Rodriguez at WNO 26, will take on Felipe Costa, while IBJJF crown winner Andy Murasaki takes on Daniel Sathler.\n\nOutside of the Ffion Davies vs. Adele Fornarino main event, there are also multiple female BJJ champions on the card as well. Check out the already stacked line up for UFC FPI 10 below.\n\nUFC Fight Pass Invitational 10: Davies vs. Fornarino fight card\n\nFfion Davies vs. Adele Fornarino\n\nNick Rodriguez vs. Victor Hugo\n\nRenato Canuto vs. Oliver Taza\n\nElisabeth Clay vs. Brianna Ste-Marie\n\nHelena Crevar vs. Maggie Grindatti-Lira\n\nCassia Moura vs. Sarah Galvao\n\nRonaldo Junior vs. Felipe Costa\n\nAndy Murasaki vs. Daniel Sathler\n\nMove of the Day\n\nSarah Galvao following footsteps of BJJ legend father\n\nAndre Galvao\u2019s daughter Sarah Galvao is currently a brown belt world champion, and recently showcased her skills in her professional no gi debut. Watch her nasty attacks after locking up a rear triangle, including a suloev stretch attempt and the Americana finish from WNO 26.\n\nAs noted above, Galvao will continue her pro grappling career and will be competing at UFC FPI 10 next.\n\nRolls\n\nTye Ruotolo vs. Dante Leon title bout set\n\nBJJ star Tye Ruotolo is set to return against two-time no gi world champion Dante Leon at ONE Fight Night 31. The grappling match happens on May 2, 2025, with Ruotolo\u2019s ONE title on the line.\n\nBoth Leon and Ruotolo are considered among the top pound-for-pound grapplers in the world. Despite both being among the smaller grapplers in the tournament, both notably took bronze medals at the ADCC absolute division, with Ruotolo in 2022 and Leon in 2024.\n\nBoth BJJ stars are currently 1-1 against each other, with Leon winning a decision in 2020, and Ruotolo winning by guillotine in 2021.\n\nCooldown\n\nNAGA to give equal pay for male and female champions\n\nThe North American Grappling Association or NAGA has revamped their pay structure to give equal prize money for men and women. The long running organization known for their no gi competitions will have new payouts (HT: JitsMagazine) for the champions of their expert absolute divisions, depending on the bracket size.\n\nThey\u2019ll give $1000 for winners of brackets with over 16 competitors, $750 for brackets of 12-15 competitors, $500 for 8-11 competitors, and $250 if there are only 4-7 competitors.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously not huge money, but this is certainly a step in the right direction, especially considering how there are many larger BJJ events that don\u2019t even give any prize money.\n\nReview\n\nTo close things out, here are other interesting BJJ stories you might have missed:\n\nFor the latest Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and grappling-related news click here.",

            "content": "John Danaher recently shared his thoughts on the Craig Jones Invitational (CJI), nearly four years after the highly publicized split of the Danaher Death Squad (DDS). Once the most dominant team in the grappling circuit, DDS fractured amid rising tensions, leading to the formation of Craig Jones\u2019 B-Team.\n\nAd\n\nSince then, Jones has carved his own path in the grappling world, and CJI marked his boldest move yet. The tournament, a direct competitor to the ADCC Submission Fighting World Championship, offered a groundbreaking $1 million prize to the winners of each division. The tournament set new standards in athlete compensation and event production.\n\nDespite past tensions, Danaher had nothing but praise for the inaugural CJI event. He acknowledged the immense effort it took to put together a high-caliber show in such a short time. He also spoke about the logistical and bureaucratic challenges involved in organizing an international tournament.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nSpeaking about the event on the Jake Shields' Fight Back Podcast, Danaher said:\n\nGet the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\n\n\"That was a fantastic show. They did an incredible job... They did an incredible job against all the odds. The show wasn't even conceived until a relatively short time before it was put in place... Now, you ask anyone who's even put on a local martial arts show\u2014just some show in a local high school gymnasium\u2014it\u2019s tough.\"\n\nAd\n\nHe added:\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to do a lot of work, you\u2019ve got to get a lot of little bureaucratic things done. And to put on an international-level show, I think they had like three or four months to get it ready, it\u2019s not long at all. And to get it that good on the first attempt, it was impressive.\u201d\n\nAd\n\nCheck out John Danaher's quotes below (1:44:50):\n\nAd\n\nJohn Danaher dismisses rumors of rifts with Craig Jones\n\nJohn Danaher went on to address rumors of a rift with Craig Jones in the aforementioned podcast episode with Jake Shields, claiming that he never had personal issues with him.\n\nHe praised Jones and his team for organizing an impressive grappling event under challenging conditions. Danaher commended the athletes, organizers, and cameramen for their contributions, acknowledging the event as a major step forward for the sport.\n\nAd\n\nSpeaking about the last text Jones sent him, Danaher said:\n\n\"We never actually had a fallout. Well, I could read you a text that he sent. It was his last text he sent to me, and you'll see that there was no falling out. But whatever happened after that, you'd have to ask Craig.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

This sharp decline came hot on the heels of a fourth-quarter earnings report that failed to meet Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations, with earnings per share (EPS) at $2.14\u2014just shy of the predicted $2.16. Despite achieving a substantial $6.5 billion in revenue, concerns over shrinking profit margins and conservative forecasts cast a shadow over the stock, resulting in a frantic sell-off.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing the commotion? The forecast for Q1 paints a grim picture, as Danaher predicts a low-single digits revenue decline, with projections set at $5.6 billion, falling short of the anticipated $5.9 billion. This would mean a 2.5% year-over-year drop in revenue, coupled with a disheartening 4% decrease in core revenue.\n\nYet, amidst the storm, CEO Rainer M. Blair remains hopeful, citing robust order trends in bioprocessing and a growing market presence in molecular diagnostics.

What are the current market trends affecting Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR)?\n\nDanaher Corporation is navigating a volatile market, with trends showcasing increased scrutiny over profit margins and conservative revenue forecasts. With significant pressure from the medical and bioprocessing sectors, the company\u2019s anticipation of a low-single digits revenue decline for Q1 puts it at a critical juncture. Nevertheless, there\u2019s optimism due to robust order trends in bioprocessing and molecular diagnostics. Analysts are closely watching these sectors as potential growth engines, despite the current pressures. The demand for innovative healthcare and diagnostics solutions could provide a solid footing if capitalized well.\n\nInnovations and Use Cases\n\n2. How is Danaher planning to utilize innovations to improve its market position?\n\nDanaher remains a formidable player in the molecular diagnostics sector, dedicated to leveraging innovations in bioprocessing technologies.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Danaher\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the CFO & Executive VP, Matthew McGrew, for US$5.4m worth of shares, at about US$253 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$206. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.\n\nDanaher insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nDanaher Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Danaher. In total, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development Daniel Raskas sold US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Danaher\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Danaher insiders own about US$16b worth of shares (which is 11% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Danaher Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nBut note: Danaher may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Now, he is likely going to have to have his other hip and both knees replaced soon to prevent further issues. As a result of all of these surgeries and injuries, John writes;\n\nAs such I will most likely have to make a reappraisal of my role in Jiu jitsu coaching. I hope that given enough time I can return to high level coaching but it may be that I have to switch focus to more recreational Jiu jitsu coaching.\n\nThis would be a significant loss for the competitive grappling community. John has been a revolutionary force within the sport, with his students regularly leading the charge in developing new systems and techniques that then permeate the competitive landscape. The growth of the sport over the last decade can be tied to these students and the submission-heavy style that John has helped develop.\n\nWhile his students have developed into very good teachers, and perhaps someone like Gordon Ryan himself could take over the responsibilities of leading Team New Wave, there's no replacing the man who put it all in motion. We wish John all the best in his upcoming surgeries and look forward to whatever is next from him.\n\nWatch BJJ On FloGrappling\n\nFloGrappling is the streaming home to the best Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu events and news coverage.

            "content": "Washington, DC-based Danaher Corporation (DHR) is a leading global life sciences and diagnostics innovator, helping solve many of the world\u2019s most important health challenges. It focuses on areas such as Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Biotechnology and more. Valued at $146 billion by market cap, Danaher employs over 61,000 people and operates in 50 different countries and 700 locations across the globe.\n\nThe healthcare giant has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past year. DHR stock has plummeted 15.7% over the past 52 weeks and 11.3% on a YTD basis, lagging behind the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 23.5% surge over the past year and SPX\u2019s 4% gains in 2025.\n\nZooming in further, DHR has also lagged behind the iShares Global Healthcare ETF\u2019s (IXJ) modest 2.5% gains over the past year and a 6.4% surge in 2025.\n\nDanaher\u2019s stock prices plunged over 9.7% after the release of its mixed Q4 results on Jan. 29. While the company delivered a 2.1% year-over-year growth in revenues to $6.5 billion which surpassed the Street\u2019s expectations, its adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 2.4% year-over-year to $2.14 per share which missed the consensus estimates by 1.4%. Furthermore, the company expects its Q1 non-GAAP core revenue to decline by a low-single-digit and this wasn\u2019t received well by the market.\n\nFor the current fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect DHR to report a modest 2.5% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP EPS to $7.67. Furthermore, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it missed the expectations on one other occasion.\n\nDespite the recent underperformance, analysts remain optimistic about Danaher's longer-term prospects. Among the 24 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 17 \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and six \u201cHold\u201d ratings.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago when 15 analysts gave \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendations and two advocated \u201cModerate Buy\u201d ratings.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Citigroup (C) analyst Patrick Donnelly reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on DHR, however, the firm lowered its price target for the stock to $265.\n\nDHR\u2019s mean price target of $269.55 represents a 32.4% premium to current price levels, while its street-high target of $310 indicates a staggering 52.3% upside potential.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Territorial seas lie closest to a nation\u2019s shore, and the laws of a country apply within and below those waters the way they do on land, for the most part.\n\nFarther beyond the shore, a country\u2019s exclusive economic zone is where it controls what is in the water, like fish, as well as what is in and below the seabed, like oil and gas. Additionally, the gulf contains sections of so-called high seas, where a country might also retain rights only to the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil.\n\nMaritime claims by area Country Square miles Share Mexico 292,400 49% Territorial Seas 23,700 4% Economic zones 262,800 44% High seas 5,800 1% United States 273,200 46% Territorial Seas 36,300 6% Economic zones 232,300 39% High seas 4,600 1% Cuba 31,600 6% Territorial Seas 3,400 1% Economic zones 27,700 5% High seas 500 <1% Source: Sovereign Limits Note: Figures may not add up to 100 percent because of rounding.\n\nThe gulf, like many regions around the world, has maritime boundaries that are mutually agreed upon by the countries along its coast. According to Kevin Danaher and Marissa Wood at Sovereign Limits, the gulf is \u201ccovered fully by established maritime boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico has appeared on maps for centuries, but geographic name changes are common throughout history. This name change has an immediate impact on U.S. federal agencies that map or refer to the gulf. Some companies such as Google and Apple now display Gulf of America for users in the United States. For others, the name change is optional.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best manufacturing stocks to buy now.\n\nThe manufacturing sector stands as a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, significantly contributing to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and technological innovation. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector contributed approximately $2.3 trillion to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 10.2% of the total U.S. GDP. Additionally, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that as of January 2025, the manufacturing sector employs approximately 12.76 million individuals.\n\nReshoring and Strategic Shifts:\n\nIn recent years, the sector has experienced notable trends that are reshaping its landscape. One prominent development is the movement towards reshoring\u2014the practice of bringing manufacturing operations back to the United States. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, ongoing trade frictions with China, and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reconsider the risks of offshoring. The decline in China\u2019s factory activity and the country\u2019s economic slowdown have also contributed to this shift, as firms seek to reduce their dependency on a single manufacturing hub. In fact, according to a report by CNBC, mentions of \u201creshoring\u201d in the broader market\u2019s earnings transcripts surged by 128% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, outpacing even the rise in discussions about artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Trends:\n\nManufacturing stocks have shown resilience over the past year. Despite challenges like inflation and shifting interest rates, the sector has benefited from strong domestic demand and strategic investments in technology. In 2024, greater asset price dispersion across securities, sectors, and countries created strong alpha opportunities for hedge funds. This market dynamic coincided with a significant increase in corporate profits within the U.S. manufacturing sector, which experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11.1%, as reported by NIST.\n\nOutlook and Future Growth Prospects:\n\nThe outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector is cautiously optimistic. Despite ongoing challenges, a focus on innovation and supportive policies position the sector for steady growth. According to a report by Reuters, in January 2025, manufacturing expanded for the first time since 2022, with the ISM manufacturing PMI rising to 50.9\u2014the highest reading since September 2022. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best manufacturing stocks.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best medical device stocks to buy right now.\n\nOverview of the Medical Devices Sector\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the medical devices market has a size of $681.57 billion as of 2025. The massive industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.99% between 2025 and 2030, reaching a market size of $955.49 billion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nThis significant growth can be attributed to various megatrends in the healthcare sector. The aging population worldwide is one of the primary factors affecting the industry. This is especially true in high-income countries such as the US, as around 17% of the country\u2019s population is 65 or older as of 2023. This is causing an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, which is ultimately driving the demand for medical devices.\n\nThis demand is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decades. According to statistics by the United Nations, the number of people aged 65 or older is anticipated to represent around 16% of the world\u2019s population by 2050, which translates to around 1.5 billion people worldwide. This demographic shift is anticipated to materialize especially prominently in regions such as Europe and North America, where the population of 65 or older is expected to reach 26.9% by 2050.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Furniture Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nContinued Growth in the US Medical Device Manufacturing Sector\n\nIn addition, technological advancements such as the increasing use of AI, predictive analysis, and advanced algorithms are metamorphosing the healthcare technology industry. While North America is the largest medical device market, Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing.\n\nAnother report by Grand View Research estimates that the market size of medical device manufacturers in the US is around $256.2 billion as of 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% between 2025 and 2030. The primary reasons behind this growth include the increasing geriatric population, the growing number of road and sports accidents, the expanding geographic reach of the key players in the market, and the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures in the industry.\n\nThe Future of the Healthcare Industry in the US\n\nAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth.",

Rales highlighted this responsibility: \u201cIt\u2019s about rethinking how we lead our companies and how we cultivate a workforce for a future that\u2019s increasingly digital and interdisciplinary.\u201d\n\nMany in the field recognize looming social challenges with new technology, but few \u2014 if any \u2014 know how to solve them. Algorithms can and are being optimized, but how do scientists control for the human element?\n\nThe promise and hype of AI\n\nLess than a decade ago, AI in biomedicine was largely theoretical. Today, breakthroughs in natural language processing and transformer-based large language models (LLMs) form the backbone of many AI tools. These models, capable of analysing patterns in vast multimodal datasets, hold the potential to transform modern medicine, from research to patient care.\n\nSummit panellists (clockwise from top) Jose-Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, Martin Stumpe, Eric Topol Credit: Danaher Corporation\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen in my years as a physician-scientist what we\u2019re looking at now,\u201d explained Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and member of Danaher\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board. Many AI-driven tools can already help extract meaningful information from medical images, health records, and biomarker data that would otherwise be overlooked by human observers. Such tools, he argues, may soon be integrated into routine healthcare to improve disease risk assessments, diagnostics, and overall outcomes. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nDrug developers now harness multimodal data to uncover novel targets and build libraries of promising candidates, fueling a growing appetite for AI in clinical settings.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, business demand lagged behind AI\u2019s potential. Success now lies in seamlessly integrating AI and the digital world with the physical one,\u201d explained Martin Stumpe, chief data & AI officer at Danaher. \u201cNow, we\u2019re seeing significant buy-in and pull for getting AI into real applications across the entire business.\u201d\n\nBut where excitement mingles with rapid technological advances, real potential can be hard to distinguish from hype. \u201cWhen it comes to molecules, we are entering a world where we can do almost anything we want,\u201d said Gevorg Grigoryan, chief technical officer and co-founder of Generate Biomedicines. \u201cBut to translate to clinic, we need to know what questions to ask. There\u2019s a lot of biology we don\u2019t understand, and we often don't know what questions to ask this magical molecular compiler.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, there is little doubt that the potential impact of AI is high. Translating this potential into reality will require the research community to address more than just the algorithms.\n\nAddressing the human in the room\n\nAI is principally a human endeavor \u2014 conceptualized, developed, deployed, regulated, and received by humans whose interactions with the technology will dictate its impact. LLMs trained on biased datasets risk reduced accuracy, physicians may distrust enigmatic AI assistants, and even powerful tools can falter if they are too costly or cumbersome to use.\n\nThe first step towards translating AI into real-world benefits starts with developers examining their own potential biases. Much has been written on the biases in biomedical databases, which have historically represented males with European ancestry. \u201cAI outputs are mirrors of our culture and its embedded biases,\u201d explains Topol. \u201cWe must have purposeful efforts to avoid leaving anyone behind.\u201d\n\nSummit panellists (clockwise from top left) Vardit Ravitsky, Steve Rales, Vanessa Almendro. Credit: Danaher Corporation\n\nConsidering ethical and legal questions at the outset can also help. \u201cEthics and law should guide design to enable new technology. As afterthoughts, they become barriers,\u201d warned I. Glenn Cohen, professor of law at Harvard Law School. But Vardit Ravitsky, president and CEO of The Hastings Center noted that data diversity, privacy, and other common AI concerns are not new to biomedicine: \u201cWe have foundational principles and frameworks.\u201d\n\nThe industry must also cultivate a market ready for AI. \u201cWe do so much at the front end of this innovation journey, yet so little is done to prepare the healthcare ecosystem to adopt these technologies,\u201d explains Almendro.\n\nDevelopers must create tools that are both in demand and accessible, addressing significant problems while earning user trust. Topol references studies comparing the accuracy of pathological findings reviewed by AI alone versus AI paired with expert pathologists. Surprisingly, AI performed better on its own. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why, it could be because physicians have automation bias and neglect, or it could be that they don\u2019t have AI training.\u201d\n\nScientists must determine whether these kinds of results can be explained by a lack of training, trust, or intuitive user interface, and adjust accordingly to improve the physician experience. The same holds true for regulators, payors and patients.\n\nA multifaceted approach is needed to build trust in AI tools. Some speakers call for transparency in AI mechanics and decision-making, while others stress clear validation criteria and signals to help physicians assess AI uncertainty. All agree on the need for a strong evidence base.\n\nIn preclinical settings, optimal use of AI will depend on company structure and culture. AI has the potential to greatly change preclinical drug development, shifting much of the work into a computational setting. Whether it\u2019s in target validation, drug candidate design, or data processing, AI is becoming integral to drug development pipelines. But the drug development industry has yet to integrate AI fully to support rapid decision-making and resource allocation. To do this, change will be needed throughout company culture.\n\nPreparing for the AI future\n\n\u201cIn the next 75 years, science will be fundamentally computational, and Danaher will be a part of it,\u201d proclaimed Jose-Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, chief science officer at Danaher, speaking to the deep influence AI is expected to have in biomedicine and how companies like Danaher can help.\n\nAccounting for biases, educating users, and evolving industry culture will be critical next steps. These are no small hurdles. But Rales reassured that neither the technical nor human challenges need to \u2013 or can \u2013 be addressed alone. \u201cOur ambition at Danaher is simple: We want to become a leader in applying AI to life sciences and diagnostics, and we want to be recognized as the collaborator and partner of choice in that process. We\u2019re prepared to make the commitment necessary to earn trust as we continue to stand with one foot in the future.\u201d",

It will grow from $2.84 billion in 2024 to $3.02 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to dental health awareness, aging population, restorative dentistry needs, cosmetic dentistry culture, dental tourism, and insurance coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dentures market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $4.07 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to regulatory compliance, oral health education, minimally invasive dentistry, increasing medical tourism, and emerging market expansion. Major trends in the forecast period include digital dentures, interest in sustainable and biocompatible denture materials, 3D scanning for precise measurements, advancements in denture materials, and adhesive-free dentures.\n\n\n\nThe increasing prevalence of periodontal diseases and edentulism is anticipated to drive the growth of the denture market in the coming years. For example, in March 2023, the World Health Organization, a Switzerland-based governmental body, estimated that oral diseases affected nearly 3.5 billion people in 2022. Additionally, in February 2024, the British Dental Association, a UK-based health organization, reported that over 12 million adults in England have unmet dental needs. Therefore, the high prevalence of periodontal diseases is expected to drive growth in the denture market.\n\n\n\nThe rapid pace of urbanization is expected to drive the growth of the dentures market in the future. For example, in February 2024, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based nonprofit affiliated with the University of Oxford, approximately 7 billion people were living in urban areas worldwide. This figure is projected to rise to 9.8 billion by 2050, resulting in more than a 50% increase in the urban population. Consequently, rapid urbanization is fueling the growth of the dentures market.\n\n\n\nThe denture market is witnessing a notable trend with the introduction of advanced technical equipment. Major players in the dentures market are driving innovation through the introduction of cutting-edge technologies, exemplified by the adoption of ceramic-infused 3D printing resins.\n\n\n\nIn August 2024, Ultradent Products Inc., a US-based manufacturer of dental products, acquired Medicinos Linija UAB for an undisclosed amount. This acquisition is intended to enhance Ultradent's product offerings and expand its market presence in the dental industry by leveraging i-dental's innovative technologies and expertise in dental materials. Medicinos Linija UAB is a Lithuania-based company specializing in the manufacture of dentures.\n\n\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the dentures market in 2024. The regions covered in the dentures market analysis report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, and Africa. The countries covered in the dentures market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, and USA.",

Oliver will remain as advisor to the company until the end of 2025.\n\n\"As I come to know Johnson Controls, I am energized by its mission-driven culture and strong 140-year legacy of developing market-leading technology and solutions that enable customers to manage their facilities in a smarter, more sustainable, and more productive way,\" said Weidemanis. \"I am deeply passionate about leading global technology-driven businesses that help customers advance their goals and make a meaningful, positive impact on society.\u201d\n\nOliver added: \u201cJoakim is the ideal person to lead Johnson Controls as CEO. The efforts we have made over the past eight years have transformed Johnson Controls into a simpler, more profitable, and faster-growing company, better able to deliver on our financial and operational objectives. As we build on the momentum from fiscal 2024, I look forward to working with Joakim and the team to ensure a smooth leadership transition and a promising future for Johnson Controls.\u201d\n\nJohnson Controls provides and deploys data center solutions across more than 150 countries. The company acquired Norwegian heat pump provider Hybrid Energy in January 2023 and formed a dedicated data center solutions business in June last year.\n\nAround the same time as Oliver\u2019s resignation was announced, the company sold its Residential and Light Commerical HVAC business to an all-cash transaction to the Bosch Group in an $8.1 billion deal.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 9 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently pointed out some unexpected trends in the stock market this year, spotlighting a group of companies that have largely flown under the radar. These stocks, often overshadowed by the heavily discussed \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, the dominant tech giants, are making significant gains without the fanfare. Cramer called them \u201cquiet winners,\u201d emphasizing that many of these stocks, particularly those outside the tech sector, are not getting the recognition they deserve from Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nCramer elaborated further on this point, noting that the leading stocks in 2025 have emerged from an unexpected mix of sectors, making this trend all the more interesting. Cramer remarked that it is clear that there is a shift happening in the market, with industries beyond tech making significant strides, yet remaining largely underappreciated by the broader investing community.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the insurance industry has experienced a particularly strong few years, noting its impressive pricing power, which has translated into higher premiums. This, in turn, has allowed insurance companies to invest those premiums in the bond market, generating significant returns.\n\nAdditionally, Cramer argued that the market often gets the most obvious things wrong, which ends up costing investors dearly. In his usual candid style, Cramer emphasized that while no investment is entirely foolproof, certain stocks show more resilience than others. \u201cThe key is to buy them when they\u2019re down because they won\u2019t stay down for long,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe continued, acknowledging that some stocks have stumbled recently, but he believes that many of the non-tech winners from this year still have room to grow. His message to investors was clear: focus on these quieter, non-tech stocks, as they have the potential to deliver strong returns even as the tech sector struggles with occasional setbacks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 6. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nCramer noted that Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) turned out to be bad for him and expressed disdain about management\u2019s attitude during the latest earnings call.\n\n\u201cDanaher\u2019s been bad for me\u2026 I\u2019ve known the company for so long, but that last quarter was terrible and frankly, they were very smug on the call talking about how good it was and that was a very ill-advised strategy that they adopted and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) designs and manufactures a broad range of products and services across several industries, offering solutions for therapeutic development, clinical diagnostics, and laboratory research. Discussing a factor that has been impacting the company, Cramer recently commented, \u201cThe one\u2026 sharp as a tack people, actually Danaher, who\u2019ve lost their way and don\u2019t even know it, have been bashed by China.\u201d\n\nOverall, DHR ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While everyone is fixated on the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, Cramer highlights nine overlooked companies that are quietly racking up impressive gains.\n\nThis year\u2019s stock market is showcasing a growing shift in sectors, moving beyond traditional tech strongholds. Cramer underscores the potential of these lesser-discussed stocks, inviting investors to pay attention to opportunities outside Wall Street\u2019s spotlight, especially in the insurance industry, which is basking in its newfound pricing power and substantial returns through bond investments.\n\nDespite some stocks taking recent hits, Cramer\u2019s message rings clear: invest in these underappreciated gems when they\u2019re down, as they have the potential to bounce back swiftly. He emphasizes that non-tech stocks could lead the charge in market growth, even as tech struggles with fluctuations.\n\nOne particular stock, Danaher Corporation (DHR), has stirred debate. Following a disappointing quarter, Cramer criticized its management for a seemingly arrogant demeanor during the earnings call, suggesting they\u2019ve \u201clost their way.\u201d While Danaher remains a major player, Cramer hints that AI stocks could present even more lucrative prospects.\n\nThe takeaway? Keep your eyes peeled for these quiet market movers, as they just might be the keys to unlocking your next big investment success. Don\u2019t miss out on these hidden treasures just waiting to shine!\n\nUnlocking Hidden Investment Opportunities: The New Frontiers of Stock Market Success\n\nIn a year that has seen headlines dominated by major tech players, Jim Cramer, the renowned host of Mad Money, is turning the focus toward a different category of investments: the quiet winners. While the market buzz revolves around the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, Cramer has spotlighted nine lesser-known companies making significant strides and returns.\n\nEmerging Trends in the Stock Market\n\nThis year\u2019s stock market signals a transformation as it shifts beyond traditional tech sectors, indicating a potential renaissance for industries that have been historically overlooked. Cramer emphasizes the burgeoning insurance industry, which is benefiting from enhanced pricing strategies and remarkable returns from bond investments. This represents a fundamental change as investors are encouraged to explore these avenues instead of solely fixating on mainstream tech stocks.\n\nKey Insights into Investment Strategies\n\nCramer\u2019s advice is clear: when it comes to investing, timing can be pivotal, especially with the lesser-discussed stocks that are temporarily undervalued. Those who identify these quiet gems during downturns might find themselves with substantial growth opportunities as market conditions improve.\n\nImportant Questions About Investing in Quiet Winners\n\n1. What are the defining characteristics of Cramer\u2019s \u201cquiet winners\u201d?\n\nCramer\u2019s \u201cquiet winners\u201d are typically companies that demonstrate consistent performance, growth potential, and often remain under the radar compared to more prominent tech stocks. These companies are marked by solid fundamentals, innovative business models, and an ability to thrive during economic shifts.\n\n2. Why is the insurance industry considered a strong contender for investment?\n\nThe insurance sector is currently enjoying a unique position due to increased market pricing power, allowing firms to adjust rates effectively. Combined with healthy returns from bond investments, the industry is positioned for growth, making it an attractive alternative for investors seeking stability and profit outside of high-flying tech stocks.\n\n3. How has Danaher Corporation (DHR) impacted investor perception following recent criticism?\n\nDanaher Corporation, while recognized as a major entity in its field, faced scrutiny from Cramer for its leadership\u2019s perceived arrogance during a not-so-good earnings report. This criticism could lead to a reevaluation of the company\u2019s stock among wary investors, creating speculative opportunities. While there are concerns about its management, Cramer suggests looking at emerging sectors like AI for potentially more promising investments, reflecting a shift in where investors may want to allocate resources.\n\nLooking Forward: Predictions and Opportunities\n\nThe broader market indicates that non-tech stocks may play a critical role in the recovery and future growth of investor portfolios. As investors remain cautious about rising tech valuations amidst economic uncertainties, Cramer\u2019s insights may prove invaluable for those seeking to diversify their holdings and locate the next big opportunity.\n\nSuggested Related Links\n\n\u2013 CNBC\n\n\u2013 Mad Money\n\nIn summary, as the landscape of the stock market evolves, keeping an eye out for these quiet winners might be the key to unlocking substantial investment rewards in the near future.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently examined the latest market trends, highlighting some important themes where stocks have faced challenges, especially those reliant on business with China.\n\nHe pointed out that certain stocks often experience significant drops after earnings reports, a trend he has observed consistently. However, Cramer cautioned that finding buying opportunities from these dips is not always as simple as it may seem. While these stocks might appear attractive when they get hit, he emphasized that they are typically impacted unjustifiably, suggesting that if you buy them whenever they drop, you would likely see positive returns. He added:\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re probably saying, can it really be that easy? I mean, why aren\u2019t I a millionaire? Well, I\u2019ll tell you why. Because there are landmines, real landmines in the yellow brick road times when the dips are milling at the beginning so I\u2019m gonna spell those out for you too.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks and Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently\n\nOne of the first questions Cramer believes investors should ask themselves is whether a stock is tied to China in any way. This dependency, he mentioned, has severely impacted many companies recently. Cramer also pointed out that retailers, especially department stores, have taken a hit, as well as companies in the chemical sector, which heavily rely on Chinese demand. According to Cramer, these businesses need orders from China to stay afloat, making them vulnerable to fluctuations in that market.\n\nAnother factor Cramer highlighted is the growing impact of GLP-1 drugs, which have the potential to curb cravings for certain food products. Cramer pointed to beloved brands like Hershey, Oreos, and Fruit Loops, among others, which are now facing challenges as these drugs reduce consumer desire for such treats. He noted that with demand for these products waning, the stocks of companies producing them are suffering.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Always remember that there are indeed Teflon stocks in any market. The key? Don\u2019t buy them unless and until they get knocked down and then remember they\u2019ll get up again. You are never gonna keep them down.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nAvantor missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 0.7% last quarter, reporting revenues of $1.71 billion, flat year on year. It was a softer quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates and EPS in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nIs Avantor a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Avantor\u2019s revenue to be flat year on year at $1.71 billion, improving from the 4% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.26 per share.\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Avantor has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates four times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Avantor\u2019s peers in the research tools & consumables segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Bio-Techne delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 9%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 4.2%, and Danaher reported revenues up 2.1%, topping estimates by 1.6%. Danaher traded down 10% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Bio-Techne\u2019s results here and Danaher\u2019s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the research tools & consumables segment, with share prices up 2.3% on average over the last month. Avantor is down 2.6% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $26.37 (compared to the current share price of $21.55).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

            "content": "Danaher did not report good earnings last week, and the market punished the stock for these. The stock dropped more than 9% and lost all the ground it had covered in January. Healthcare as a whole (and bioprocessing in particular) had had a strong start to the year in the hope of a recovery from the headwinds suffered in 2024:\n\nMany people have claimed that Danaher\u2019s earnings and post-market reaction are signs that the bioprocessing cycle is not over yet, but this is not an accurate description of what is actually happening. The weakness came from places other than the company\u2019s biotechnology business. Diversification has pros (it can be more defensive) and cons (the strength of different franchises might hide behind the weakness of others). Danaher is suffering from the latter.\n\nI\u2019ll try to talk a bit about everything in this earnings release (including the \u201cpuzzling\u201d buybacks), but let\u2019s start first with how Danaher performed during the quarter.\n\nDanaher\u2019s quarterly performance\n\nDanaher did not perform terribly against estimates, beating top-line estimates but slightly missing those on the bottom line:\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nMissing/beating quarterly estimates is not in and of itself worrying, but estimates for Danaher have been going south for a while. This is what an analyst said during the earnings call:\n\nSo if you go back and look at how 2025 EPS expectations have progressed over time, if you go back to the beginning of 2023, the street was at 11.20. At the beginning of last year, the street was at around 8.80. Yesterday estimates were at 8.09. And if I'm doing the math right, I think you essentially guide it to around 7.60. So it's hard for a stock to work, when the estimates keep moving in the wrong direction.\n\nThe fact that analysts thought that 2025 EPS would be $11.20 is maybe more a consequence of their recency bias than anything else, but there\u2019s no denying that estimates have kept creeping down:\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the stock is down 20%+ since the 2021 peak. So, yes, the company's poor performance justifies (to an extent) the stock's poor performance, and there\u2019s no sugarcoating this. Danaher\u2019s performance is evidently tied to the pandemic\u2019s boom and bust, but this doesn\u2019t change much as stock prices don\u2019t just react to company-specific performance but also to the environment. Maybe some analysts are starting to get a little bit \u201cfed up\u201d with Danaher\u2019s weak guidance, but I\u2019ll explain later on why there might be a good reason behind the weak guidance.\n\nIf we look at Danaher\u2019s performance, we can see that revenue barely increased over the period. It was $22.3 billion in 2020 and ended 2024 at $23.9 billion, an increase of 7.2% over four years or a 1.7% CAGR. FCF per share has fared even worse; it was $7.5 in 2020 and ended 2024 at $7.2, so it decreased.\n\nBelow you can see a summary of the company\u2019s quarter:\n\nDanaher ended 2024 on a good note, although it has been a transition year for the company. Core revenue (akin to \u201corganic\u201d) was down 1.5% in 2024, driven by the poor performance of the Biotechnology Segment and aided by Diagnostics:\n\nAs I\u2019ll discuss later on, the performance of the different segments is expected to be markedly different in 2025. It wasn\u2019t a good year either from the POV of profitability. GAAP EPS was down 6.3%, whereas non-GAAP EPS was down barely 1.3%. The difference between both stems primarily from the amortization of intangibles and impairments:\n\nNote that Danaher is an acquisitive company. This means we should be careful when examining GAAP EPS (and the P/E multiple, for that matter). The reason lies in accounting rules. Danaher tends to record goodwill (the difference between the price paid and the fair value of the acquired assets) when it makes an acquisition, and this goodwill needs to be amortized over a given period.\n\nEverything makes sense until here. The \u201ctrick\u201d comes from the fact that accounting rules assume that this goodwill is losing value over time (recorded as \u201camortization of intangibles\u201d) and that the goodwill will eventually lose all of its value unless the company does something to change it (similarly to when a company reinvests into Capex to cover Depreciation and to maintain its physical assets productive). There\u2019s a difference between both scenarios, though.\n\nIntangibles don\u2019t always have to be replaced and can \u201cwear off\u201d much slower than accounting rules might portray. In other cases, the investment necessary to keep the value of these intangibles intact is already accounted for in the income statement (for example, through R&D or SG&A investments). The latter can be the case for brands or for software-like businesses that are aquisitive, like Constellation Software. Constellation Software has to amortize the intangibles it acquires, but the expenses to \u201creplace\u201d these (if any) will probably already be included under R&D expenses in the income statement. This means that Constellation can potentially suffer the same expense twice (R&D and amortization) on the same income statement, making the EPS number and the P/E misleading. Depreciation and Capex are different because physical assets do depreciate, and their counterpart is Capex, which appears in a different financial statement (cash flows). This means that there\u2019s no double counting in the income statement.\n\nOne easy way to circumvent the \u201cproblem\u201d created by the amortization of intangibles is to focus on cash flows. Danaher is famous for having achieved a FCF conversion rate of 100%+ for over 20 years. This sounds great, but we should be aware that it\u2019s the result of its acquisitive nature more than its business model. I don\u2019t doubt that management is proficient in driving cash flow conversion through DBS. I am only saying that cash conversion is not apples to apples when comparing Danaher to a non-acquisitive company. That, and that Danaher shouldn\u2019t be viewed on an EPS or P/E basis but rather on a FCF or EV/FCF basis.\n\nCash flows were a highlight in 2024. Despite the drop in revenue and earnings, Operating Cash Flow was up 3% and Free Cash Flow was up 3.5%:\n\nThis means that Danaher managed to post a 22% FCF margin despite suffering a bad year. This is great because it allows the company to be countercyclical (either with repurchases or M&A) and is one of the characteristics I mentioned in a recent article: \u2018A fertile ground for the individual investor.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the most pressing topic of the release.\n\nGuidance and why I believe it\u2019s being sandbagged",

On numerous occasions, Jones has almost crossed the limits of acceptable behavior.\n\nAd\n\nWith his sense of humor, Jones has created a sizeable fan following. Recently, the 33-year-old grappler seemed to put his life on the line in African wildlands. In an Instagram video posted on Monday, Jones interacted with hyenas, possibly domesticated ones.\n\nAn African man in the video whistled instructions to the hyena and the animal jumped onto Jones' arm. Most hyenas can't be domesticated, but striped ones can be trained, particularly when young. The African in the videos is Yusuf, an Ethiopian popularly known as the 'Hyena Man' of Harar.\n\nAd\n\nTrending\n\nAd\n\nGet the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\n\nAs expected from him, Jones captioned the post with a se*ual connotation:\n\n\"Normally I\u2019d use protection with an African guy\u2019s meat.\"\n\nThe post drew numerous reactions from martial arts fans, often making hilarious ones. One fan trolled Gordon Ryan, Jones' ex-teammate and the arguable GOAT of no-gi grappling.\n\n\"Let's see Gordon Ryan do that.\"\n\nJones and Ryan were once teammates under John Danaher's DDS (Danaher's Death Squad). A rift caused them to part ways with Danaher forming New Wave Jiu Jitsu with Ryan, while Jones formed B Team Jiu-Jitsu, both based in Austin, Texas.\n\nAd\n\nOne fan's comment received a reply from Jones as well. The individual commented:\n\n\"Shoutout to Yusuf, the hyena man of Harar.\"\n\nJones responded by saying:\n\n\"Tag the legend\"\n\nHere are the other reactions:\n\n\"Lol aint no body more brave than YT people.\"\n\n\"The caption gave me visuals \ud83d\ude05\"\n\n\"\ud83d\ude02 but real question how bad do those hyenas smell?\"\n\nCheck out the collage of reactions below:\n\nAd\n\nFan reaction screenshots. [Screenshots courtesy @craigjonesbjj on Instagram]\n\nCraig Jones explains training under John Danaher\n\nOn his appearance on episode #157 of Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) MMA Show, Craig Jones shared the pressures of training under John Danaher. His answer came when Rogan, who described Danaher as a movie character, inquired how it was to train under him.\n\nAd\n\nFor Jones, Danaher's 365-day-a-year training program didn't seem right. He said:\n\n\"I mean, I wouldn\u2019t do it, you know? I\u2019d be like, 'Bro, what\u2019s taking a day off? Let me have a day to relax.' I wouldn\u2019t necessarily do it. I mean, it was a lot of training, though. He kind of wanted it to be your life, you know? And obviously, it should be, but a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure to be a part of that team,\" said Craig Jones.\n\nAd\n\nCheck out Craig Jones' comments below (50:54):\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy.\n\nOverview of the Global Oncology Sector\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030.\n\nAccording to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032.\n\nSome of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners and 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\n\nTrends in Precision Oncology\n\nThe precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024.",

            "content": "It was a busy week of trades for the Club amid a volatile period for the stock market. Tech stocks experienced a deep sell-off Monday on the emergence of DeepSeek , a Chinese startup with an AI model that it claims is cheaper and more efficient than current models. It called into question whether artificial intelligence chip demand might need to be scaled back. That crushed Nvidia on Monday and the stock ended the week down more than 15%. After watching Nvidia all week, Jim Cramer on Thursday told Club members that he would trim the position if not restricted. \"While believing Nvidia should still be 'owned, not traded' that does not give us license to turn a blind eye to a change in the facts. We can own Nvidia, of that there is no question,\" Jim wrote. \"But to own this amount of Nvidia, to me, is to ignore the possibility that tech customers will pause or bargain with Nvidia for better pricing or seek out less powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices .\" On their post-earnings conference calls this past week, Meta Platforms and Microsoft did not adjust their capital expenditure spending plans as a result of DeepSeek. That was a bit of relief. But, as Jim pointed out on Friday, Alphabet and Amazon report earnings next week \u2014 so, we don't know the bigger, near-term capex impact until we hear from them. Here's a cheat sheet of this week's trades for Jim's Charitable Trust , the portfolio used for the CNBC Investing Club. The market was overbought for most of the week, which figured into the sales we made. Friday's selling moved it out of overbought status. On Tuesday, we did buy some shares of Eaton, which were caught up in the DeepSeek mess. Eaton is a U.S. industrial company that makes the kinds of electrical components and power management systems needed to run data centers properly. Eaton reported earnings Friday and said its data center business remains robust. Tuesday, Jan. 28 Bought 25 shares of Eaton Trust owns 300 shares of ETN Portfolio weighting: 2.68%, as of Friday Rating: 1 Price target: $375 ETN 1Y mountain Eaton 1 year Trade Alert excerpt: \"Although we understand there's plenty of uncertainty about DeepSeek and acknowledge the risks, we think this nearly 20% pullback over two days reflects a lot of downsides. While it's likely AI costs will come down in the future, we don't expect the pace of new data center builds to slow in the immediate term. Outside of data centers, it's always good to remember that Eaton is at the heart of so many other megatrends like electrification, the energy transition, digitization, infrastructure spending, reindustrialization, and green regulations.\" Sold 10 shares of CrowdStrike Trust owns 245 shares of CRWD Portfolio weighting: 2.67%, as of Friday Rating: 2 Price target: $400 CRWD 1Y mountain CrowdStrike 1 year Trade Alert excerpt : \"We remain long-term believers in cybersecurity, which is why we own two, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks in the portfolio. But with Crowdstrike shares up about 20% over the past 11 trading sessions, we would feel like pigs if we didn't take profits on this big win. We're downgrading the stock to our 2 rating and realizing a great 30% gain on stock purchased in October 2024.\" Sold 50 shares of Danaher Trust owns 525 shares of DHR Portfolio weighting: 3.2%, as of Friday Rating: 2 Price target: $270 DHR 1Y mountain Danaher 1 year Trade Alert excerpt : Since late October, we've added to Danaher on five occasions \u2014 starting around $255 a share, all the way down to $230 in November and then, most recently, at around $240 just two weeks ago . The result is that we're now carrying too much stock, and shares have climbed nearly 9% over the past month. We'll still own plenty of stock into earnings in case Danaher offers an upbeat view of the bioprocessing market, but this sale will provide us some protection should management give a more cautiously optimistic guide. Monday, Jan. 27 Sold 75 shares of GE Healthcare Trust owns 900 shares of GEHC Portfolio weighting: 2.18%, as of Friday Rating: 2 Price target: $95 GEHC 1Y mountain GE Healthcare 1 year Trade Alert excerpt : \"We're taking advantage of the market's rotation into health-care stocks by locking in profits in GE Healthcare. Following an up-and-down 2024, GE Healthcare shares have gotten off to a strong 2025. ... With the stock trading near $90 on Monday, [however], we don't think the risk/reward is as good as our low $80 upgrade. Therefore we are taking off some stock and moving our rating to a 2, meaning we would look to buy more shares on a pullback.\" (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says He's In Waiting For AI GPU Spending Clarity. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether the low AI development costs demonstrated by China's DeepSeek AI models would upend investor expectations of AI spending. Ever since the AI wave kicked off in November 2022, businesses have committed and spent hundreds of billions of dollars to procure AI GPUs and develop data centers to host them. The high spending requirements also led President Trump to announce a massive $500 billion Stargate project earlier this month.\n\nHowever, data center stocks crashed on Monday and wiped out a trillion dollars of value as investors worried whether low AI development costs would mean that this spending would not materialize. Cramer is divided about the overall sentiment when it comes to AI spending after the DeepSeek selloff.\n\nHe commented that the lower costs are \"the theme of the moment because some people saw it coming.\" Cramer added \"and yet they still ordered. That would be the Zuckerberg case, maybe the Musk piece.\" On the other hand, he outlined that others \"just say oh my, what am I in, I'm gonna go buy a double short NVIDIA.\" Finally, the CNBC host also shared a third category of people \"who think that it's [Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock] a hand cream.\"\n\nWhile investors fretted about lower AI costs translating into weaker demand for items such as GPUs, another narrative questioned whether lower costs meant that AI development would open up to more firms and entities than the higher costs had previously permitted. Cramer admitted that this was possible, but added that it also meant that perhaps \"the monopoly rent that people feel that\" the premier GPU company \"was charging is gone.\" He added that he was in wait-and-watch mode when it came to AI spending.\n\nCramer noted several events that could signal to him that perhaps the narrative shift surrounding AI spending was permanent. One of his tests \"test would be, uh, is, Three Mile Island not going to be reopened? That would be one I need to hear.\" The second driver that might convince the CNBC TV show host of a paradigm shift for AI spending would be reports of \"any [GPU] order pullback. And I have not heard that yet.\" Cramer added \"But that's not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, 'listen, I've decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I'm going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.' I've not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\"",

They expect life science tools to grow low single digits, with Pall and genomics down. Growth is anticipated to improve each quarter, with Q1 down mid-single digits, flattish in Q2, and ramping up thereafter.\n\nQ: How is the new US administration affecting your market outlook, particularly regarding academic government funding?\n\nA: Rainer Blair noted that while it's early days with the new administration, they expect a more business-friendly environment. The election hasn't changed their view on their portfolio, which is positioned towards attractive growth trends in Life Sciences and Diagnostics. They anticipate some fluctuations but are confident in leveraging their portfolio and the Danaher Business System to outperform.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the Diagnostics segment's performance, particularly regarding Cepheid respiratory and VBP in China?\n\nA: Matt McGrew, CFO, stated that Cepheid respiratory is expected to generate $1.7 billion, reflecting a normal respiratory season in an endemic state. The VBP impact in China accelerated in Q4, with $150 million expected for the year, up from the previous $50 million annual expectation.\n\nQ: How is AI being leveraged across Danaher, particularly in diagnostics and R&D?\n\nA: Rainer Blair highlighted that AI is being used to accelerate assay development and integrated evidence plans, as well as in decision support systems. In diagnostics, AI is aiding in digital pathology, helping pathologists make faster and more accurate diagnoses.\n\nQ: What is the status of the Abcam and Aldevron acquisitions relative to their deal models?\n\nA: Matt McGrew mentioned that Abcam is tracking close to its deal model, while Aldevron is behind due to slower-than-expected market recovery in genomics. Despite this, they remain committed to owning these businesses for their long-term potential in life sciences.\n\nQ: How does the strong order growth in bioprocessing impact forward growth expectations?\n\nA: Rainer Blair noted that strong order growth, particularly in the fourth quarter, sets up well for 2025. The recovery is underway, with consumables back to normal and equipment demand improving, supporting their 6% to 7% core growth guidance for the year.\n\nQ: How are patent expirations expected to impact Danaher's growth, particularly in bioprocessing?\n\nA: Rainer Blair explained that bioprocessing is driven by volume, and biosimilars, resulting from patent expirations, are a tailwind. As biosimilars penetrate new markets, they drive higher volumes, benefiting Danaher's growth.\n\nQ: What are the biggest risks and potential upsides to your 2025 guidance?\n\nA: Matt McGrew emphasized a bottom-up approach to guidance, incorporating internal and external factors. Risks include noise in Life Sciences, while potential upsides could come from better-than-expected market conditions and cost management.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

            "content": "Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 9.2% to US$223 in the week after its latest annual results. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$24b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 5.5% to hit US$5.29 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Danaher\n\nNYSE:DHR Earnings and Revenue Growth January 31st 2025\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Danaher's 25 analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$24.1b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 4.3% to US$5.65. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$24.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.54 in 2025. The analysts seem less optimistic after the recent results, reducing their revenue forecasts and making a substantial drop in earnings per share numbers.\n\nDespite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the US$271 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Danaher at US$310 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$240. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that Danaher's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 1.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 3.1% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.0% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Danaher is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands among Wednesday\u2019s worst-performing stocks.\n\nThe stock market declined on Wednesday, with all major indices finishing in the red, driven by losses in technology stocks.\n\nThe Nasdaq dropped 0.51%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones fell 0.47% and 0.31%, respectively.\n\nTen companies, mostly from the technology sector, led the downturn. In this article, we will highlight the biggest decliners and examine the factors driving their performance.\n\nTo identify Wednesday\u2019s biggest losers, we focused on stocks with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion and a daily trading volume of over $5 million.\n\nWhy Danaher Corp (DHR) is Crashing?\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nConglomerate Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) saw its share prices drop by 9.65 percent on Wednesday to finish at $223.73 apiece after missing earnings per share expectations for the first time in years, having settled at $2.14 versus the $2.16 projection.\n\nIn addition, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) posted a bearish outlook for the first quarter of the year, anticipating a low single-digit drop in revenues at $5.6 billion as compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of $5.9 billion. However, full-year earnings are projected to inch up by 3 percent year-on-year.\n\nDespite the numbers, Danaher Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rainer Blair said that the company remains hopeful amid resilient order trends in bioprocessing and market share growth in molecular diagnostics.\n\nOverall, DHR ranks 4th on our list of Wednesday\u2019s worst-performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Danaher Corporation ((DHR)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nDanaher Corporation\u2019s recent earnings call painted a picture of mixed sentiment, with notable strengths and challenges that investors are keenly observing. The strong cash flow and innovative strides have been warmly received, yet concerns linger over core revenue growth and specific segment declines, particularly in Diagnostics and the China market.\n\nStrong Free Cash Flow and Share Repurchases\n\nDanaher Corporation showcased its robust financial health by generating $5.3 billion in free cash flow in 2024, marking a remarkable 33-year streak of free cash flow to net income conversion exceeding 100%. The company further demonstrated confidence in its prospects by deploying approximately $7 billion to repurchase 28 million shares of its common stock, a move that underscores a commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n\nBioprocessing Business Momentum\n\nThe bioprocessing business continues to shine, exhibiting high-single-digit core revenue growth. This momentum is sustained by six consecutive quarters of high-single-digit sequential order growth, highlighting the sector\u2019s resilience and continuous demand.\n\nInnovative Product Launches\n\nInnovation remains a cornerstone of Danaher\u2019s strategy, with the introduction of groundbreaking products like Cytiva\u2019s Sefia cell therapy manufacturing platform, Beckman Coulter\u2019s Cydem VT Automated Cell Culture System, and the DxI 9000 immunoassay analyzer. These innovations not only enhance customer capabilities but also advance critical healthcare solutions, positioning Danaher at the forefront of industry advancements.\n\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share Increase\n\nDespite some challenges, Danaher reported a 2.4% year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted net earnings per common share, reaching $2.14 in the fourth quarter. This increment reflects the company\u2019s ability to navigate a complex market environment while still delivering shareholder value.\n\nCore Revenue Decline\n\nDanaher faced a 1.5% decline in core revenue for 2024, with particular difficulties in the Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. This downturn signals areas that require strategic focus to recapture growth momentum.\n\nDiagnostics Segment Revenue Decrease\n\nThe Diagnostics segment saw a 2% decrease in core revenue during the fourth quarter, influenced by external factors such as volume-based procurement in China and a sluggish start to the respiratory season. These issues highlight the segment\u2019s vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\nWeakness in China Market\n\nChina\u2019s market challenges persist, with mid-single-digit core revenue declines. The difficult funding environment and aggressive volume-based procurement measures have impacted performance, necessitating strategic adjustments to navigate these headwinds effectively.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Danaher Corporation anticipates a 3% core revenue growth despite a 2% revenue headwind from currency fluctuations. The company projects an adjusted operating profit margin of 28.5% and continues to focus on strategic investments and innovations, particularly in biotechnology, life sciences, and diagnostics. These efforts aim to ensure sustainable long-term growth and enhanced shareholder value.\n\nIn conclusion, Danaher\u2019s earnings call reflects a landscape of both opportunity and challenge. The company\u2019s strong cash flow, strategic share repurchases, and innovative product launches are promising, while segment declines and market-specific challenges warrant careful monitoring. Investors will be watching closely as Danaher navigates these dynamics in the coming year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

A: Rainer Blair, President and CEO, explained that the Life Sciences segment is facing some external noise, leading to a prudent approach in guidance. They expect life science tools to grow low single digits, with Pall and genomics down. Growth is anticipated to improve each quarter, with Q1 down mid-single digits, flattish in Q2, and ramping up thereafter.\n\nQ: How is the new US administration affecting your market outlook, particularly regarding academic government funding? A: Rainer Blair noted that while it's early days with the new administration, they expect a more business-friendly environment. The election hasn't changed their view on their portfolio, which is positioned towards attractive growth trends in Life Sciences and Diagnostics. They anticipate some fluctuations but are confident in leveraging their portfolio and the Danaher Business System to outperform.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the Diagnostics segment's performance, particularly regarding Cepheid respiratory and VBP in China? A: Matt McGrew, CFO, stated that Cepheid respiratory is expected to generate $1.7 billion, reflecting a normal respiratory season in an endemic state. The VBP impact in China accelerated in Q4, with $150 million expected for the year, up from the previous $50 million annual expectation.\n\nQ: How is AI being leveraged across Danaher, particularly in diagnostics and R&D? A: Rainer Blair highlighted that AI is being used to accelerate assay development and integrated evidence plans, as well as in decision support systems. In diagnostics, AI is aiding in digital pathology, helping pathologists make faster and more accurate diagnoses.\n\nQ: What is the status of the Abcam and Aldevron acquisitions relative to their deal models? A: Matt McGrew mentioned that Abcam is tracking close to its deal model, while Aldevron is behind due to slower-than-expected market recovery in genomics. Despite this, they remain committed to owning these businesses for their long-term potential in life sciences.\n\nQ: How does the strong order growth in bioprocessing impact forward growth expectations? A: Rainer Blair noted that strong order growth, particularly in the fourth quarter, sets up well for 2025. The recovery is underway, with consumables back to normal and equipment demand improving, supporting their 6% to 7% core growth guidance for the year.\n\nQ: How are patent expirations expected to impact Danaher's growth, particularly in bioprocessing? A: Rainer Blair explained that bioprocessing is driven by volume, and biosimilars, resulting from patent expirations, are a tailwind. As biosimilars penetrate new markets, they drive higher volumes, benefiting Danaher's growth.\n\nQ: What are the biggest risks and potential upsides to your 2025 guidance? A: Matt McGrew emphasized a bottom-up approach to guidance, incorporating internal and external factors. Risks include noise in Life Sciences, while potential upsides could come from better-than-expected market conditions and cost management.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "In a shocking morning slump, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) fell a staggering 8.6%, marking its most significant drop since April 2023. Investors were left reeling after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report missed Wall Street expectations. With earnings per share coming in at $2.14, slightly below the $2.16 forecast, concerns quickly mounted. Although revenue reached $6.5 billion, surpassing some estimates, troubling profit margins and cautious guidance sent the stock spiraling.\n\nThe forecast for Q1 isn\u2019t looking bright: Danaher anticipates a low-single digits revenue decline, projecting just $5.6 billion instead of the expected $5.9 billion. While the company aims for a 3% rise in full-year sales, the stark reality is that Q1 2024 revenue already fell 2.5% year-over-year, with core revenue down 4%.\n\nDespite the numbers, CEO Rainer M. Blair maintains a hopeful outlook, pointing to resilient order trends in bioprocessing and market share growth in molecular diagnostics. However, the reality is that a Q2 core revenue drop in the mid-single digits might alarm investors, who have long been accustomed to Danaher\u2019s strong performance.\n\nTrading at 31 times expected 2025 earnings\u2014well above the S&P 500\u2019s 22x multiple\u2014investors expect perfection. Though 83% of analysts still rate Danaher as a Buy, it\u2019s clear: if the company can\u2019t convert its guidance into actual growth, a changing tide may lead investors to seek more reliable shores.\n\nKey takeaway: Tough forecasts and margins challenge Danaher\u2019s resilient reputation\u2014time will tell if they can bounce back.\n\nDanaher Corp: A Troubling Revenue Forecast Sparks Investor Concerns\n\nIn recent trading sessions, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) witnessed a significant decline of 8.6%, the steepest drop since April 2023. This downward spiral followed the release of their fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The company\u2019s reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.14 was below the anticipated $2.16, raising questions about its financial health. While revenue reached $6.5 billion\u2014exceeding some estimates\u2014the report also indicated concerning profit margins and cautious guidance, leading to a steep sell-off of shares.\n\nMarket Trends and Insights\n\n1. Q1 Revenue Forecast: Expectations for the first quarter are grim, with Danaher projecting a low-single digits revenue decline and an anticipated revenue of $5.6 billion, lower than the predicted $5.9 billion. This translates to a troublesome year-over-year decline of 2.5%, coupled with a 4% drop in core revenue.\n\n2. Resilience in Key Segments: Despite these challenges, CEO Rainer M. Blair expressed optimism about submerged order trends in the bioprocessing sector and growth in molecular diagnostics, intending to keep the company\u2019s long-standing reputation intact.\n\n3. Stock Valuation vs. Performance: Currently trading at 31 times expected earnings for 2025, Danaher\u2019s valuation surpasses the S&P 500 average of 22x. As the stock remains under close scrutiny, investor confidence may wane if the company cannot translate its forecasts into tangible growth.\n\nKey Questions Answered\n\n1. What are the main factors driving Danaher\u2019s stock decline?\n\n\u2013 The stock decline primarily results from a disappointing earnings report that missed EPS estimates and offered bleak forecasts for Q1 2024 revenue. The negative outlook, especially regarding profit margins and core revenue for Q2, raises concerns for investors.\n\n2. How does Danaher plan to recover from this slump?\n\n\u2013 Danaher aims to focus on its strong positions in bioprocessing and molecular diagnostics to drive growth. The management\u2019s strategy includes enhancing operational efficiencies and capitalizing on resilient order trends in key markets.\n\n3. Is Danaher still a viable investment?\n\n\u2013 While 83% of analysts maintain a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Danaher, investor sentiment may shift if the company fails to deliver on its revenue projections. It remains crucial for Danaher to convert its promises into results to restore investor confidence.\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n\u2013 Pros and Cons:\n\n\u2013 Pros: Strong positions in high-growth markets like bioprocessing; historically solid performance; significant revenue figures.\n\n\u2013 Cons: Recent earnings miss; cautious guidance; high valuation in comparison to peers.\n\n\u2013 Future Predictions: Analysts are watching closely to see if Danaher can regain momentum, particularly in Q2, where core revenues are projected to decline further.\n\nFor ongoing insights and updates on Danaher Corporation, check out Danaher Corporation.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.",

            "content": "On January 29, 2025, Danaher Corp (DHR, Financial) released its 8-K filing detailing the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company, which has evolved from a real estate organization into a leading manufacturer of scientific instruments and consumables in the life sciences and diagnostics industries, reported mixed results against analyst expectations.\n\nPerformance Overview\n\nDanaher Corp reported fourth-quarter net earnings of $1.1 billion, translating to $1.49 per diluted common share. This was below the analyst estimate of $1.70 per share. However, the non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.14, surpassing expectations. Revenue for the quarter increased by 2.0% year-over-year to $6.5 billion, slightly above the estimated $6,424.46 million. The company's non-GAAP core revenue saw a modest increase of 1.0%.\n\nFinancial Achievements and Challenges\n\nFor the full year 2024, Danaher Corp reported net earnings of $3.9 billion, or $5.29 per diluted common share, which fell short of the annual estimate of $5.57. The non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.48. Total revenues for the year were $23.9 billion, aligning closely with the estimated $23,774.23 million, though core revenue decreased by 1.5%.\n\nOperating cash flow for the year was robust at $6.7 billion, with a non-GAAP free cash flow of $5.3 billion. These figures underscore the company's strong cash generation capabilities, which are crucial for sustaining operations and funding strategic initiatives in the competitive Medical Diagnostics & Research industry.\n\nIncome Statement and Key Metrics\n\nDanaher Corp's income statement highlights a steady revenue stream, with a slight year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues. The balance sheet remains strong, supported by significant operating cash flow. The company's ability to generate free cash flow is a key metric, reflecting its capacity to invest in growth opportunities without relying on external financing.\n\nCommentary and Future Outlook\n\nRainer M. Blair, President and CEO, stated, \"We finished the year strong, with better-than-anticipated core revenue in all three of our segments. Good execution by our team also drove solid cash flow and operating margin expansion.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Danaher Corp anticipates a low-single-digit decline in non-GAAP core revenue for the first quarter of 2025, but expects a 3% increase for the full year. This outlook reflects the company's strategic focus on life sciences and diagnostics, following the divestiture of its environmental and applied solutions group, Veralto, in late 2023.\n\nAnalysis and Conclusion\n\nDanaher Corp's performance in 2024 highlights its resilience and strategic positioning in the life sciences and diagnostics sectors. While the company faced challenges in meeting EPS estimates, its revenue growth and strong cash flow generation are positive indicators. The focus on core revenue growth and operational efficiency will be critical as Danaher navigates the evolving market landscape in 2025.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Danaher Corp for further details.",

            "content": "Investors, brace yourselves! The latest round of stock insights is here. During the electrifying segment of \u201cMad Money,\u201d Jim Cramer tackled an array of stocks, providing critical advice for savvy traders.\n\nHe started with Danaher, expressing confidence in the company\u2019s potential but emphasized the need for strong performance to match its reputation. Meanwhile, Coterra was highlighted as a bargain in the natural gas sector, suggesting it stands out due to its low valuation compared to peers.\n\nAs for Grail, Cramer acknowledged its impressive science but warned viewers about its substantial recent surge, recommending caution until the stock recalibrates and sheds some of its recent gains. He also addressed BlackRock, describing its restful phase in the market as a moment ripe for investment, given its promising long-term growth trajectory.\n\nFor Digital Realty, Cramer advised patience, indicating that an eventual drop in stock price could present a better buying opportunity, steering investors away from stocks on steep upward trends.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of investing, following Cramer\u2019s guidance could be crucial. Subscribers to the CNBC Investing Club can access his strategies and updates as they unfold, ensuring they don\u2019t miss a beat in the ever-changing market landscape.\n\nTo get in touch with Cramer, potential investors can dial 1-800-743-CNBC or connect through social media platforms.\n\nThe Implications of Stock Market Dynamics\n\nAs stock insights continue to permeate the financial community, they hold greater implications for society and the global economy. The stock market is often seen as a barometer for economic health. When investors react to expert guidance, such as that from Jim Cramer, it can drive market swings that influence the wealth of countless individuals. This interconnectedness underscores the vital role investors play in shaping economic landscapes.\n\nMoreover, trends in stock performance can ripple through various sectors, affecting employment rates and consumer spending. For instance, if companies like Danaher or Coterra thrive due to positive stock performance, it could lead to increased hiring and innovation, reflecting a robust corporate culture. Conversely, caution advised for overperforming stocks, like Grail, could indicate a protective stance against potential economic volatility.\n\nEnvironmental impacts also intertwine with stock dynamics, particularly in sectors like natural gas and technology. Sustainable investing trends are gradually compelling companies to prioritize ecological accountability, reshaping corporate strategies for the betterment of our planet.\n\nLooking ahead, the rise of digital assets and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing is likely to redefine the investment landscape. The emphasis on sustainability may provoke a paradigm shift, encouraging investors to seek long-term stability rather than short-term gains. As these themes evolve, they will undoubtedly cement their long-term significance in a global economy increasingly driven by the values of its consumers and investors alike.\n\nExpert Stock Insights: Navigating the Market Like a Pro\n\nInvestors are continually looking for the latest market insights to maximize their portfolios. In a recent episode of \u201cMad Money,\u201d Jim Cramer provided valuable analysis on several stocks, highlighting key trends, potential risks, and opportunities that savvy traders should consider.\n\nStock Highlights and Analysis\n\nDanaher Corporation (DHR)\n\nDanaher has been a stock that investors are keenly watching. Jim Cramer expressed a positive outlook, underscoring the company\u2019s robust capabilities and innovative products. However, Cramer warned that for Danaher to maintain its solid reputation, it needs to deliver strong performance consistently. Investors should keep an eye on Danaher\u2019s earnings reports and management guidance to assess its trajectory.\n\nCoterra Energy (CTRA)\n\nCoterra Energy stands out in the natural gas sector, and Cramer pointed to its low valuation relative to its peers as an attractive buying point. With the increasing demand for natural gas as a transitional energy source, Coterra is well-positioned for growth. Investors should consider market conditions and geopolitical factors affecting the energy market as potential drivers for Coterra\u2019s stock performance.\n\nGrail (GRAL)\n\nGrail has garnered attention for its scientific innovations within the healthcare sector. Cramer acknowledged the company\u2019s significant rise recently, which raises concerns about volatility. He advised investors to proceed with caution, suggesting that a pullback might be necessary for the stock to regain its stability. Monitoring FDA approvals and clinical trial outcomes will be crucial for potential investors in Grail.\n\nBlackRock (BLK)\n\nCramer identified BlackRock as a solid investment opportunity, praising its long-term growth potential. He noted that the company is currently experiencing a \u201crestful\u201d phase, providing a favorable entry point for investors. Given its massive influence on global investment strategies and trends in asset management, BlackRock remains a staple for any diversified portfolio.\n\nDigital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR)\n\nIn the realm of data centers and real estate investment trusts (REITs), Cramer urges patience with Digital Realty. He believes that the company may experience a short-term drop in stock price, presenting a better buying opportunity for long-term investors. The growth of cloud computing and data demand continues to highlight the importance of Digital Realty\u2019s services.\n\nPros and Cons of Current Stock Choices\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Danaher: Strong fundamentals with a history of innovation.\n\n\u2013 Coterra: Attractive valuation in a growing sector.\n\n\u2013 BlackRock: Established brand with long-term growth prospects.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Grail: Recent volatility makes it risky for immediate investments.\n\n\u2013 Digital Realty: Short-term fluctuations may deter investors seeking immediate gains.\n\nMarket Trends and Predictions\n\nAs the markets evolve, it\u2019s essential for investors to stay informed about broader trends. The push toward clean energy continues to reshape the landscape for companies like Coterra, while innovations in healthcare could further impact stocks like Grail. Additionally, the steady growth of digital infrastructure is a key trend benefiting Digital Realty.\n\nInvestment Strategies\n\nFor those looking to navigate these stock options, a diversified investment strategy is recommended. Monitoring earnings reports, market news, and broader economic indicators will be essential. Joining communities, such as the CNBC Investing Club, can provide real-time updates and insights from experts like Jim Cramer.\n\nFor further resources and investment wisdom, explore the insights shaping today\u2019s market at CNBC.",

            "content": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 45.1x Danaher Corporation ( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 18x and even P/E's lower than 11x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\n\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Danaher's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nHow Is Danaher's Growth Trending?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Danaher would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 11% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 31% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 16% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 11% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Danaher's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Danaher's P/E\n\nWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\n\nWe've established that Danaher maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nHaving said that, be aware in our investment analysis, you should know about.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than Danaher.

It has made it challenging to provide care while limiting virus spread, and it has increased the demand for hospital resources. Global healthcare systems have found adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic's problems difficult. So, since the epidemic started, surgeons have observed a drop in the number of elective surgeries performed. This postponement of non-urgent elective surgeries has an impact on planned oncology procedures. Tumor patients are particularly vulnerable to infection.Moreover, patients with cancer have higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology's study, there was a significant drop in biopsies, tumour screens, office visits, therapy, and surgeries from March to July 2020 compared to 2019. Cancer screenings for colon, breast, lung, and prostate were 75%, 85%, 56%, and 74% lower in April 2020, when the pandemic was at its worst. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of almost 800 appointments for the screening of lung cancer in just March 2020. The ratio of new patients screening remained low even after the screening returned to its regular frequency.List of Prominent Players in the Cancer Diagnostics Market:\u2022 Abbott Laboratories,\u2022 Agilent Technologies Inc.,\u2022 AMOY Diagnostics Co Ltd.,\u2022 Astellas Pharma Inc.

For instance, Hologic, Inc. declared that the Genius Digital Diagnostics System would be commercially available in Europe starting in 2021. The next-generation cervical cancer screening system uses new volumetric imaging technology and deep learning-based AI to help find women with precancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells. This should accelerate market growth.Challenges:Many hospitals in undeveloped and impoverished countries are unable to purchase diagnostic imaging equipment due to high costs and financial restrictions. Yet, due to the rising demand in these nations for diagnostic imaging procedures, hospitals that cannot afford to purchase brand-new, cutting-edge imaging systems favour rebuilt ones. As a result, this factor inhibits market expansion.Regional Trends:Due to strategic moves made by major players, a significant increase in cervical screening programmes run to improve awareness and screening, a rise in R&D, and technical advancements, Asia Pacific is predicted to have the quickest growth throughout the projection period. For instance, National Cervical Cancer Awareness Week 2019 was introduced by the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF) in November 2019. The ACCF wants to raise awareness among women all throughout Australia in order to eradicate cervical cancer by the year 2035. One of the companies supporting the ACCF screening programmes is Hologic Inc.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 In November 2021, Magnetom Free was introduced by Siemens Healthineers.

            "content": "EAST Clare wind farm developers are experiencing turbulence for AirNav Ireland and Shannon Airport who are continuing to oppose their plans for large-scale renewable energy projects.\n\nTheir latest objection concerns the proposed 12 turbine windfarm, located on a 140-hectare site located within the townlands of Cappateemore East, Ballycannan West, Ballycannan East, Ballycar South, Ballycar North, and Glennagross, which is being considered by An Bord Plean\u00e1la.\n\nThe Broadford to Oatfield Windfarm Action Group is appalled that windfarm developers persist with their plans in East Clare, despite the categorical safety objections from both Shannon Airport and Air Navigation Ireland.\n\nIn a statement to The Clare Champion, the group claimed these developers have been given every opportunity to demonstrate solutions to the air safety issues raised by Irish air safety professionals but have repeatedly failed to do so.\n\n\u201cAir safety should always trump commercial profits. Notably, the Oatfield windfarm has been objected to by AirNav Ireland on three occasions when submitted by multiple developers,\u201d said the statement.\n\n\u201cLocal communities do not want these noisy, intrusive wind farms. Developers consistently claim their projects will supply energy to numerous homes, but the reality is different. Research by Professor Hannah Daly of UCC, commissioned by Friends of the Earth, reveals that between 2017 and 2023, all additional wind energy generation was absorbed by data centres.\n\n\u201cConsequently, renewables are not delivering net reductions in fossil fuel use in power generation.\u201d\n\nAlex O\u2019Connor of the Broadford to Oatfield Windfarm Action Group stated the safety and well-being of the community must come first. These East Clare developments pose unacceptable risks and fail to address the fundamental concerns raised by experts.\n\n\u201cIt is high time these commercial investors stopped dreaming of their shareholder profits and accepted what they are trying to force through is unacceptable on so many levels\u201d.\n\nIn a letter to the board, Air Nav Ireland stated it initially agreed in principle to the development, subject to evidence being supplied that expected issues could be appropriately mitigated.\n\nHowever, it noted the content of the supplied Aviation Response Statement has not adequately addressed the concerns of AirNav Ireland. The greatest cause of concern for AirNav is the generation of radar beam deflections that would generate false targets at higher altitudes and at distance of up to 250 nm.\n\nThe Request for Further Information as lodged has no standing without a full review by Air Nav Surveillance and NAVAIDs teams including a demonstration of how mitigation measures, if available could be applied.\n\nAirNav noted it didn\u2019t support plans for a wind farm at Carrownagowan or Lackeragh, objected to the Oatfield wind farm on three occasions, when submitted by multiple developers, objected to Knockshanvo and sought a formal assessment for Fahy Beg.\n\n\u201cBallycar has the potential for the biggest impact on AirNav systems, without measurable, evidence-based, demonstrable mitigation measures being applied,\u201d they stated.\n\nIn its submission, Shannon Airport Safety and Compliance Manager, Paul Hennessy, said Shannon Airport Authority supports Air Nav\u2019s position of not being able to support the development on the basis that appropriate mitigation measures can\u2019t be deployed to their satisfaction to prevent impacts on the Woodcock Hill Radar site.\n\nIn its response to a Further Information Request from the board, Ai Bridges prepared a response statement to demonstrate the extensive consultation undertaken in relation to aviation concerns, raised by the IAA/AirNav Ireland and to further demonstrate that the proposed Ballycar Wind Farm will not result in an impact on aviation.\n\nFollowing additional consultation with AirNav Ireland, a planning condition was proposed whereby the Ballycar wind farm could not commence, should planning permission be received, until all aviation concerns were fully addressed to the satisfaction of AirNav Ireland.\n\nThe Response Statement outlined Ballycar Wind Farm would not result in any impacts to en-route aircraft.",

            "content": "By Coleen Danaher\n\nThe EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program offers foreign nationals the opportunity to gain permanent U.S. residency by investing in qualifying job-creating projects. EB-5 has become a popular way for immigrants to seek green cards without visa lotteries or employment restrictions.\n\nBecause of the program\u2019s popularity, investors can pick from many options when deciding which job-creating project they want to invest in. Investors want to get their invested capital back and receive their green cards, but a lack of familiarity with the program and its complexities can make it difficult to know which project to select.\n\nTo increase their chances of a successful visa petition, many investors are now seeking projects that use a third-party fund administrator to provide additional oversight.\n\nWhat is required for an EB-5 investment\n\nEB-5 investors must invest at least $800,000 in an approved project (or more, depending on the type and location of the project). This capital must be put \u201cat risk\u201d for at least two years, meaning there must be the potential for loss or gain. The project must create at least 10 full-time jobs per EB-5 investor, and these jobs must be carefully documented.\n\nMost investors choose to work with a Regional Center, which helps oversee the investment and connects them to the job-creating project. The choice of Regional Center is as important as the choice of project because it\u2019s the Regional Center that the investor will be dealing with. Because the Regional Center is such an important part of the process, there are specific compliance requirements that they and the developer must follow.\n\nThe RIA and EB-5 compliance measures\n\nWith so many parties involved and investors putting significant capital at risk, EB-5 has attracted many bad actors over the years. For a time, the program had a reputation for fraud and mismanagement of funds. That\u2019s why Congress passed the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, known in the industry as the RIA.\n\nThe RIA instituted new compliance requirements, including the mandatory use of a third-party fund administrator to co-sign on all transactions. The fund administrator is also responsible for recordkeeping and ensuring investors receive updates on the status of their investments.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for Regional Centers to receive a waiver for the fund administration requirement if they perform an annual audit of accounting practices. While audits are beneficial, they can only identify issues after the fact, when it\u2019s too late to fix things. A good fund administrator can catch problems as they happen and initiate fixes to keep projects working and ensure investor petitions are on track.\n\nWhat can happen if rules are broken\n\nViolation of EB-5 rules can result in a loss of investor capital. EB-5 funds are put at risk, which means that if they are mismanaged, there is a real chance investors could lose their savings.\n\nPenalties for violators can include termination of the Regional Center. When that happens, investors may have the opportunity to redeploy capital to another job-creating project \u2013 but that\u2019s only if they\u2019re able to get their initial investment back. And if violations aren\u2019t caught until later in the process, it can result in denial of the investor\u2019s visa petition.\n\nHow a third-party fund administrator can help\n\nThe most important function of an independent fund administrator is to provide third-party oversight. By only signing off on transactions that are in accordance with the project offering documents, the fund administrator can protect against fraud or mismanagement of funds.\n\nA fund administrator can also provide additional transparency. If the fund administrator has an online portal that provides 24/7 access, investors can easily view the status of their investments and access the information they need for their visa petitions.\n\nMost importantly, as an independent a third party, the fund administrator can identify issues and fix problems that could lead to visa denial. While investors may be new to the process and developers are focused on the project, the fund administrator\u2019s duty is EB-5 compliance. By choosing a project that works with an experienced fund administrator, EB-5 investors can get dedicated help to protect their investments and set themselves up for immigration success.\n\n(Author is Coleen Danaher, Regional Vice President of Business Development, Western U.S.)\n\nDisclaimer: Views, recommendations, and opinions expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of FinancialExpress.com.

The focus of the next few years needs to be on that success rate, because that is the biggest challenge. The cost of making medicines is high because of the cost of failure.\n\nNajat Khan, Recursion\n\nWatch: From science fiction, to science facts, to science hype: reality check\n\nOn planning ahead to make sure models actually get used:\n\nWe\u2019ve heard numerous examples of so many publications that are out there, including in diagnostics and the medical space, but the models are not getting employed for various reasons. There is a lot of opportunity to\u2013earlier, up front\u2013think about how would I deploy the model? How do I integrate it back in the real world? And that\u2019s not only in the diagnostic space which is obviously fairly complex with regulatory and reimbursements, but it also pertains to things like workflow improvements.\n\nMartin Stumpe, Danaher\n\nWatch: AI in action: moving beyond hype to meaningful impact\n\nOn keeping up with the pace of technology:\n\nThe key next challenge is that the regulatory spectrum has not kept pace with how fast these developments are happening. Digital pathology adoption in the U.S. is around 4% for clinical use, which is really low. And I think a key reason is there hasn\u2019t been a good, acceptable use case \u2013 an FDA-approved device \u2013 for primary diagnosis. That\u2019s preventing us from getting to that adoption.\n\nFaisal Mahmood, Harvard Medical School\n\nWatch: Beyond the hype: advancements in protein modeling, digital pathology, and human virtual models\n\nOn a critical hinge point for the healthcare delivery business:\n\nWe focus a lot on cost, but value-based care is quality over cost. And we need to do two things at the same time: we need to lower costs and we need to improve outcomes. Well, it\u2019s straightforward to measure costs. Coming up with ways of measuring quality is much harder, and until we get better answers to that, I think we\u2019re going to be stuck in the position we are now. Can AI be the tool by which we measure quality? Maybe. I haven\u2019t seen it yet but I hope it happens.\n\nAnthony Philippakis, GV\n\nWatch: Lost in translational AI: what is the true impact in human health?\n\nOn the importance of trust:\n\nWe\u2019re just emerging out of a pandemic that showed us that science can deliver miracles and have the tools to save lives, and people reject those tools \u2013 I\u2019m talking about the vaccines, of course \u2013 because of lack of trust. So it\u2019s not just about getting there. It\u2019s about getting there in a way that people trust, whether it\u2019s because their doctor told them or because they trust institutions to have appropriate governance.\n\nVardit Ravitsky, The Hastings Center\n\nWatch: Architecting the rules of the game: ethics and law\n\nOn how AI can make medicines better from the beginning:\n\nMost programs fail in the clinic because of the early stages of the decision-making process.

Comprehending this communication to use the part or entire setup is essential. Limitations must improve the installation and operation of automated labs in the market in detecting and analyzing novel, complicated products like machinery, tools, and equipment. Independent of the manufacturing companies, laboratory holders are required by regulation or quality control to test their products to operate efficiently and prevent situations. This can limit market expansion.Regional Trends:The North America Lab Automation market is expected to register a major market share because the United States is here, an entire nation that has made significant investments in clinical research. Due to the presence of all the major competitors in the business and strict FDA restrictions, the market in the nation is quite competitive. The nation's businesses are rapidly implementing robotics and automation in labs to get an advantage over rivals. The expansion is ascribed to the region's increased adoption of lab automation technology due to the area's established healthcare facilities. Additionally, the local presence of significant players and the favorable reimbursement framework in this area promote the market adoption of novel solutions. Besides, the Asia Pacific region had a substantial share of the market. This region's profitable expansion is also a result of increased efforts by regional and international businesses to make revolutionary lab automation technologies available in these potential markets. Among the elements anticipated to benefit the MEA market are the significant number of illnesses and getting hold of health insurance. Additionally, more government initiatives are underway to upgrade Saudi Arabia's healthcare system.Unlock Your GTM Strategy:Recent Developments:\u2022 March 2022 - The CellMek SPS, a potent remedy for manual sample preparation and data management bottlenecks in clinical flow cytometry, was introduced by Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, a global provider of life sciences lab automation and innovation and a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation.

            "content": "The year 2024 proved to be exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market rising over 23%. The Nasdaq outperformed with a nearly 29% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 rose close to 25%. These impressive gains were largely driven by the Magnificent 7 stocks, which surged by nearly 67%, along with other mega-cap companies. This marked the second consecutive year that the broader market achieved gains exceeding 20%, a feat last seen in the late 1990s.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study by Preqin revealed that institutions, including pensions, endowments, and foundations, hold $21 trillion in traditional diversified strategies, as of June 2024. These strategies allocate funds across various investments such as bonds, stocks, real estate, and cash.\n\nThat said, diversification doesn't guarantee a lack of correlation between your investments. For example, owning 100 tech stocks might reduce risk compared to holding just one, but those 100 stocks are likely to be correlated with each other. To truly minimize risk, it's important to diversify beyond just one sector. According to analysts, the higher yields on Treasury bonds could provide some protection in the event of a major stock market decline. Despite this, those who believe in diversification are facing uncertainty. US stocks continue to outperform year after year, driven by the consistent profits of American companies, making other investments seem like a path to underperformance.\n\n\"Through intelligent portfolio building and diversifying, investors can create a portfolio of risky assets with an aggregate volatility that is lower than any of the individual securities. The key here is to buy securities with attractive risk profiles that are not correlated to each other in a significant way with the goal that when one asset is performing poorly, another asset will pick up the slack through positive performance.\"\n\nDiversified stocks refer to companies involved in multiple sectors, industries, or regions. These businesses, often large conglomerates like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, generate income from a variety of operations. The main goal of diversification is to lower risk by spreading investments across various areas, reducing the potential negative impact of poor performance in any one stock or sector. Nathan Wallace, principal wealth manager at Savvy Advisors, also supported the idea of diversifying portfolio. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at some of the best diversified dividend stocks.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other diversified dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently sought comfort in dividend stocks. Among these, dividend growth stocks have gained significant interest. A report from BlackRock revealed that, over time, stocks that consistently increased or maintained their dividends have tended to perform better than those that didn't pay dividends or cut their payouts. In times of market decline, dividend-paying stocks often offer a safeguard against fluctuating share prices. Companies that pay dividends typically aim to sustain these payments and are usually hesitant to reduce them unless it's essential.\n\nWhen considering dividend stocks, investors typically assess the dividend yield. Experts suggest targeting yields between 3% and 6%, as yields higher than this could signal potential yield traps. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, has highlighted this advice. Below are some insights from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI generally like to advocate for an approach of targeting great businesses that might pay closer to a 3% to 4% dividend yield.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders. The list is ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nCramer Criticizes Danaher (DHR) for Lackluster Performance and Unimpressive Guidance\n\nA healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American global conglomerate that designs, manufactures, and markets products and services belonging to various industries. As is typical for a biotechnology, life sciences, and diagnostics company, the company\u2019s revenue and earnings have fluctuated in recent years, largely due to the pandemic. In addition to producing PCR tests for COVID-19 detection, Danaher also supplied life sciences equipment used in vaccine research. The stock has surged by over 5% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe decline in demand following the surge during the pandemic presents short-term challenges for Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). As a result, management anticipates a year of modest, low single-digit core revenue declines. However, the third quarter earnings suggest that investors may need to adjust their expectations in the near future. The company reported $5.8 billion in revenues in Q3, up 3.2% from the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts\u2019 estimates by $210 million.\n\nMadison Investments highlighted DHR in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) released its 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report. It highlighted several milestones across its three pillars of sustainability (building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and the planet, and protecting the environment). The company has committed to setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi), including reaching net-zero value chain emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share, having raised it by 12.5% in February 2024. The stock has a dividend yield of 0.44%, as of January 22.\n\nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) was included in 98 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, growing from 83 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $6 billion in total.\n\nOverall DHR ranks 1st on our list of the best diversified dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for DHR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "The Landscape of Dividend Stocks\n\nAs the financial markets evolve, diversified dividend stocks are gaining traction among investors. These stocks belong to companies that span multiple industries and regions, which can help investors mitigate risk and enhance returns. Notable firms in this space include Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), recognized for its robust dividend policy.\n\nTo understand the value of diversification, it is vital to consider the approach proposed by financial experts. They emphasize that a well-constructed portfolio should consist of assets with low correlations to each other. This strategy aims to cushion the impact when one sector underperforms while another thrives. However, it\u2019s essential to remember that simply holding many stocks in one sector, such as technology, could still expose investors to correlated risks.\n\nLooking at recent data, interest in dividend stocks remains strong. A report underscores that companies maintaining consistent dividend growth tend to outperform those that cut or fail to pay dividends. As stock markets fluctuate, these income-generating assets offer stability.\n\nThe current market landscape shows that stocks with yields between 3% and 6% are ideal targets. Analysts advise caution with higher yields, as they may disguise underlying issues. Danaher Corporation, a leader in healthcare solutions, recently raised its dividend and reported positive earnings, reinforcing its status in the market.\n\nIn a time of uncertainty, dividend stocks like Danaher Corporation are proving to be a beacon for investors seeking reliable income streams.\n\nEvaluating the Broader Impact of Dividend Stocks\n\nThe rise of diversified dividend stocks is reflective not only of investor sentiment but also of a shifting socio-economic landscape. As individuals increasingly face economic uncertainties, the appeal of consistent income streams is paramount. Dividend stocks serve as a stabilizing force within an otherwise unpredictable market. They encourage a culture of long-term investing, fostering patience among investors who may have previously favored more volatile strategies.\n\nMoreover, the surge in popularity of these income-generating assets has significant implications for the global economy. Companies that prioritize dividend growth signal financial health and resilience. This behavior can further influence corporate governance, as firms focus on returning value to shareholders. A greater emphasis on sustainability and responsible investment is emerging, with many dividend-paying companies committing to social responsibility and environmental stewardship.\n\nHowever, the potential environmental effects must also be considered. Companies that engage in dividend payments often prioritize capital allocation towards shareholder returns, which can sideline essential investments for sustainable practices. As the need for environmentally responsible growth intensifies, stakeholders are compelled to balance profit with social impact.\n\nLooking ahead, the trend toward dividend stocks is likely to continue, driven by ongoing volatility in financial markets and a societal push for fiscal responsibility. This could herald a future where investors not only seek profit but also demand transparency and sustainability from the companies in which they invest, shaping a more conscientious economic framework.\n\nInvesting in Dividend Stocks: Strategies, Insights, and Emerging Trends\n\nThe Landscape of Dividend Stocks\n\nAs global financial markets continue to evolve, dividend stocks are rapidly becoming a compelling option for investors seeking both stability and income. These stocks are issued by companies that regularly return a portion of their earnings to shareholders, primarily in the form of cash dividends. The current landscape shows that firm diversification, encompassing various industries and geographical regions, is essential for risk mitigation and enhancing overall returns.\n\nKey Benefits of Dividend Stocks\n\nPros and Cons\n\n\u2013 Pros:\n\n\u2013 Stable Income: Dividend stocks provide a regular income stream, which is particularly attractive during market volatility.\n\n\u2013 Total Return Potential: Besides providing income, many dividend-paying stocks appreciate in value over time.\n\n\u2013 Inflation Hedge: As companies grow and increase their dividends, these stocks can help combat inflation.\n\n\u2013 Cons:\n\n\u2013 Limited Growth Potential: Companies that pay high dividends may reinvest less into growth opportunities, potentially limiting capital appreciation.\n\n\u2013 Market Sensitivity: Dividend stocks can still be subject to broader market risks, especially in economically challenging periods.\n\n\u2013 Tax Implications: Dividends are often subject to taxation, which can affect total returns.\n\nKey Features of Dividend Stocks\n\nInvestors are increasingly drawn to stocks yielding between 3% and 6%, which are considered optimal for income generation without assuming excessive risk. Firms like Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) exemplify this trend with their robust dividend policies and consistent performance.\n\nMarket Analysis: Trends and Insights\n\nRecent reports indicate a steadfast interest in dividend stocks, with companies that experience consistent dividend growth often outperforming their non-dividend-paying counterparts. This phenomenon is particularly relevant as investors look for safe havens during economic fluctuations.\n\nUse Cases: Who Should Invest in Dividend Stocks?\n\n1. Income-focused Retirees: Those looking for regular income streams to support their retirement expenses.\n\n2. Risk-averse Investors: Individuals who prefer a conservative investment strategy and seek stability amidst market volatility.\n\n3. Long-term Investors: Those willing to capitalize on the compounding effect of reinvesting dividends over time.\n\nInnovations in Dividend Investing\n\nThe rise of technology has introduced new platforms and tools for dividend investors. Online brokers now offer intuitive features for tracking dividend performance, reinvesting dividends, and managing diversified portfolios. Robo-advisors are also tailoring portfolios for income-focused investors, utilizing algorithms to optimize dividend yield.\n\nLimitations and Considerations\n\nWhile dividend stocks can be appealing, some limitations should be considered:\n\n\u2013 Sector Concentration: Holding a large number of dividend stocks within one sector may expose investors to heightened risks linked to that sector.\n\n\u2013 Yield Traps: High dividend yields may signal underlying company issues; assessing the health of the company before investing is crucial.\n\n\u2013 Market Cycles: Dividend stocks still face challenges during economic downturns, making it necessary to evaluate broader market conditions.\n\nSecurity Aspects\n\nInvestors must remain cognizant of the inherent risks associated with dividend stocks. Cybersecurity threats, market volatility, and the financial health of the issuing companies are vital factors that could impact stock performance and dividend reliability.\n\nPredictions for the Future of Dividend Stocks\n\nMoving forward, analysts predict that the interest in dividend stocks will only increase, particularly as demographics shift towards an aging population seeking reliable income streams. Investors may prioritize dividend-paying assets as central to their wealth-building strategies in uncertain economic climates.\n\nIn conclusion, as dividend stocks continue to capture investor interest, understanding their value proposition and employing prudent investment strategies will be essential. Stocks like Danaher Corporation, with a strong market presence and proven track record, serve as exemplary models for what investors should seek in a robust dividend portfolio.\n\nFor more insights into market opportunities, check out Investopedia for detailed articles on investing strategies.",

            "content": "Danaher (DHR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis industrial and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $6.41 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.41% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Danaher?\n\nFor Danaher, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.40%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Danaher will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Danaher would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +9.62%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nDanaher doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months.

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Serum-free Media Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Solution, By Product, By Application, By End-use, By Type, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global serum-free media market size is expected to reach USD 4.05 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 13.7% from 2025 to 2030. The rising prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases, coupled with the growing focus on cell-based therapeutics, is increasing the market's growth prospects. In addition, growing funding for the cell-based research is the key factor driving the serum-free media market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of serum-free media has increased considerably during the past 15 years. This is mainly true in industrial applications, wherein the use of serum during the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals poses a risk to safety and a source of unwanted contamination. Moreover, Serum-free cell culture media improves the experimental constancy by reducing the number of unknown culture components and the effects of unknown growth factors, hormones, and vitamins.\n\n\n\nIn addition, serum-free media has numerous advantages, such as reducing the cost and inconvenience of batch testing sera, eliminating the uncertainty about global supply fluctuations, and simplifying downstream processing and purification, another major factor driving the market growth.\n\n\n\nAlthough CAR T-cell therapies have made breakthroughs in treating hematological malignancies, their accessibility to patients is constrained by the complexity and expense of their manufacturing. Beyond the effectiveness of your CAR-T product, one difficulty in CAR T-cell production is achieving constant growth of T cells made available following gene transfer. Therefore, optimizing the media to stimulate T-cell proliferation is one of the most important factors.\n\n\n\nYet, creating media that permits constant growth while meeting regulatory quality criteria has proven challenging. However, new developments in cell culture techniques have enhanced output and functionality in CAR T-cell workflows utilizing serum-free media, enabling the construction of large-scale regulatory-compliant processes capable of producing billions of T cells quickly.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the Vero cell line, which was derived from the kidney of an African green monkey, has been widely applied to the production of viral vaccines. Moreover, it has been utilized to manufacture several SARS-CoV variants. For instance, Lonza Bioscience's ProVeroTM1 Serum-free Medium is a protein-free non-animal origin medium intended to support the development of Vero cells and MDCK. In addition, HEKin1, manufactured by HiMedia Labs, was used to manufacture COVISHIELD, a COVID-19 vaccine containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. This vaccine has been manufactured using genetically modified HEK293 cells.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the slow growth rate of SFM as compared to the serum media, and the requirement of different cell types to prepare specific media formulations and cell clumping when passaging can be the restraining factors.\n\n\n\nSerum-free Media Market Report Highlights\n\nBased on product, CHO media dominated the market and accounted for a share of 30.9% in 2024, driven by their essential role in biopharmaceutical production.\n\nBased on application, biopharmaceutical production led the market with a revenue share of 73.7% in 2024, owing to the need for efficient, consistent cell culture systems in drug development.\n\nBased on end-use, pharmaceutical & biotechnology companies held the largest revenue share of 57.9% in 2024. These companies need serum-free media to maintain a controlled, defined environment for cell culture, thereby enhancing product quality and consistency.\n\nBased on type, liquid media dominated the market with a revenue share of 63.1% in 2024, attributed to their significant advantages in cell culture applications.\n\nNorth America serum-free media market dominated the global market with a revenue share of 38.6% in 2024. North America features a robust healthcare infrastructure, substantial biopharmaceutical investments, and a concentration of industry leaders.\n\nAsia Pacific serum-free media market is expected to register the fastest CAGR of 16.9% over the forecast period. Countries in the region prioritize developing innovative therapies and vaccines to tackle escalating healthcare challenges, including chronic diseases.\n\nThis report addresses:\n\nMarket intelligence to enable effective decision-making\n\nMarket estimates and forecasts from 2018 to 2030\n\nGrowth opportunities and trend analyses\n\nSegment and regional revenue forecasts for market assessment\n\nCompetition strategy and market share analysis\n\nProduct innovation listing for you to stay ahead of the curve\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 100 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.9 billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $4.05 billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 13.7% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\nChapter 1.

One patient recalled waiting on a trolley and chair from Monday until Saturday morning.\n\nAnother respondent claimed they were left waiting for hours before they left as it was like a \u201cwar zone\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe staff are traumatised and should not have to work in these war zone conditions especially when we are not in a war zone country,\u201d one patient said.\n\n\u201cThe patient experience is awful and the staff are dealing with sick scared people daily.\u201d\n\nThe lack of 24-hour emergency care in Clare was highlighted several times with patients stated a new Model Three hospital should be provided in Clare.\n\nOne patient said they tried to get a bed in Ennis Hospital but it was full.\n\n\u201cClare people deserve so much more than the scraps they are being thrown,\u201d said another patient.\n\nThe comments published by the FOH coincide with another surge in overcrowding in the Mid-West, which totalled 164 on Monday.\n\nThis included 138 people left waiting for beds in UHL, 16 in Ennis and ten in Nenagh.\n\nThe Mid-West Hospital Campaign condemned these figures as a \u201cnational scandal\u201d that demands immediate action.\n\nOf the 24% who attended the ED in UHL all but two were brought by ambulance.\n\nThe ambulance service received a huge amount of praise with comments like the paramedics were \u201cfabulous, kind, calm and reassuring\u201d.\n\nInside the ED in UHL the patient experience varied ranging from patients who praised nurses, some patients were treated very professionally and one was discharged from the ED in UHL in under four hours and was very happy with their care.\n\nOne patient described the staff as \u201ctop notch\u201d.\n\nFour in ten respondents rated the ED in UHL as excellent. However, the group also received some negative feedback, with 13.33% giving it a very poor rating.\n\nThe group stated considering all the media coverage about the pressure the Mid-West healthcare system is under, it performed adequately over the period in question.\n\nFOH Chairperson, Angela Coll, said long trolley waiting times are very common, citing a case of a patient who was admitted on a trolley in UHL on a Sunday and remained without a bed until Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a priority given to those 75 and older when beds are being allocated, UHL doesn\u2019t have enough beds to cater to the needs of the Mid-West population,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is before you factor in the impact of the increase in the \u2018flu, common cold, vomiting bug and other sickness.\n\n\u201cAll hospitals are under pressure but UHL doesn\u2019t have any release valve.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to end up on trolleys in UHL until another ED is provided. The 72 new beds in the 96-bed block is not going to solve the trolley problem when you have more than 100 people on trolleys and other people in surge beds.\n\n\u201cAll elective procedures in UHL have been cancelled and these beds have been turned into surge beds for ED patients. Patients will remember their bad experiences far more than their good ones in a hospital.\u201d",

The latest developments, such as image-guided biopsy devices, using ultrasound, CT scans, or MRI, ensure more accurate targeting of tissue samples, thus reducing complications and improving diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, minimally invasive biopsy tools, including vacuum-assisted and core needle biopsy devices, make the procedure faster, less painful, and with shorter recovery times, thus boosting adoption.\n\n\n\nRising Demand for Minimally Invasive Procedures\n\n\n\nThe increasing trend in the health care sector toward minimally invasive procedures has propelled the growth of the biopsy devices market. There are numerous advantages of minimally invasive biopsy techniques, including minimal discomfort for patients, quicker recovery, and shorter stay in the hospital. All these benefits have been considered of paramount importance in oncology because it demands regular biopsies to assess and decide the line of treatment. Thus, increasing awareness of these procedures further fuels the demand for biopsy devices and increases the size of the market.\n\n\n\nHigh Cost of Biopsy Procedures\n\n\n\nThe high cost of biopsy devices and procedures remains a significant challenge in the market. Advanced biopsy devices, particularly those with image-guided capabilities, can be expensive, which may limit their accessibility in low-resource settings. The overall cost of biopsy procedures, including hospital stays, imaging, and lab tests, can also be a barrier for patients, particularly in developing regions. This high cost limits widespread adoption and challenges healthcare providers aiming to implement cost-effective diagnostic solutions.\n\n\n\nRisk of Complications and Inaccuracies\n\n\n\nAlthough much improved through advanced technology, the risk of complications still exists in the form of bleeding, infection, and pain during a biopsy. Sometimes, inaccurate or unsuccessful biopsies can cause misdiagnosis or lead to repeated procedures, thereby delaying treatment. Furthermore, the complexity involved in performing biopsies from difficult locations or from tiny samples can pose a challenge. These risks can undermine the confidence of patients and slow down the adoption of new biopsy devices, especially in high-stakes procedures like cancer diagnosis.\n\n\n\nNeedle-Based Guns Biopsy Market\n\n\n\nThe Needle-Based Guns Biopsy Market refers to a segment of the larger biopsy devices market that utilize needle-based biopsy systems to sample tissues. Needle-based guns, also known as core needle biopsy guns, are widely utilized for obtaining tissue samples of various organs, such as breast, prostate, liver, and lungs. These devices use the spring-loaded mechanism to shoot a needle quickly into tissue, capturing a core sample with minimal invasiveness. The market for needle-based guns is growing due to the increasing demand for minimally invasive diagnostic procedures, as these devices reduce pain, have quicker recovery times, and lower risks of complications compared to traditional biopsy methods.\n\n\n\nLung Biopsy Market\n\n\n\nThe Lung Biopsy Market is an important part of the larger biopsy devices market, focusing on diagnostic procedures to obtain lung tissue samples. Lung biopsies are mainly used to diagnose lung cancer, infections, inflammation, or other respiratory conditions. The common procedures for lung biopsy include percutaneous needle biopsy, bronchoscopy-guided biopsy, and VATS biopsy.\n\nThe increasing incidence of lung cancer, the main cause of cancer-related deaths globally, and the rising prevalence of other lung diseases are factors that drive the lung biopsy market. The latest techniques for biopsies, which include image-guided biopsies (ultrasound, CT scans, or MRI), enhance the accuracy and safety of lung biopsies, decrease the complications, and cut the recovery time for the patient. Moreover, other less invasive biopsy options that are using smaller incisions and fewer days of recovery increase market demand.\n\n\n\nBiopsy Ultrasound-Guided Market\n\n\n\nThe Biopsy Ultrasound-Guided Market is developing with the increasing demand for less invasive diagnostic procedures having a high degree of accuracy. Ultrasound-guided biopsies make use of real-time imaging to guide the needle to the exact location of abnormal tissue, ensuring that samples are taken accurately. It is most commonly used in liver, breast, prostate, and kidney biopsies, reducing the risk of complications and increasing the success rate of the procedure. Increasing cancer cases, health awareness, and developments in ultrasound technologies are major drivers for the growth of this market.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic & Imaging Center Biopsy Market\n\n\n\nThe Diagnostic & Imaging Center Biopsy Market is growing because diagnostic and imaging centers are increasingly playing a central role in the performance of biopsy procedures. Advanced imaging technologies, including CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound, are used to guide biopsies with greater precision and lower risks. Advances in both cancers and chronic disease frequencies; and the demand in general for minimally-invasive accurate diagnostic procedures are catalysts for growth in the industry. Furthermore, the expanded uptake of specialized imaging during the biopsy procedure improves biopsy-center efficiency and success levels while yielding diagnoses.\n\n\n\nCanada Biopsy Devices Market\n\n\n\nThe Canada Biopsy Devices Market is increasing because of the growing demand for accurate and minimally invasive diagnostic tools, especially in oncology and chronic disease diagnosis. A major driver for the adoption of biopsy devices in Canada is the prevalence of cancer, particularly breast, prostate, and lung cancer. In addition, the focus on early diagnosis and precision medicine by the healthcare sector fosters market growth.\n\n\n\nBiopsy Devices Market of France\n\n\n\nThe France Biopsy Devices Market is growing steadily with the rising need for precise and minimally invasive diagnostic techniques, especially in cancer detection.

            "content": "New, Fully Automated, High-Throughput RUO Assays offered on Beckman Coulter Immunoassay Analyzers\n\nBREA, Calif. , Jan. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, a global leader in advanced diagnostics, today announced availability of new Research Use Only (RUO) blood-based biomarker immunoassays designed to advance neurodegenerative disease research. These assays are intended to assess p-Tau217, GFAP, NfL, and APOE \u03b54 biomarkers, which are emerging as the most important biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases research, including interventional clinical trials.\n\n\"Advancements in Research Use Only (RUO) assays for neurodegenerative diseases mark a transformative step in the field, offering precise tools to unravel disease mechanisms. These assays enable researchers to detect and quantify biomarkers with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, facilitating a deeper understanding of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease,\" said Dr. Nick Ashton, Senior Director, Biomarker Program at Banner Sun Health Research Institute. \"Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' commitment to delivering high-quality RUO assays exemplifies the industry's dedication to empowering scientists. By providing reliable and innovative solutions, they are driving progress toward breakthroughs in early diagnosis, personalized treatment strategies, and ultimately improved patient care. Such developments underscore the critical role of cutting-edge technologies in accelerating the path to effective therapies for these challenging diseases.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to introduce our initial set of RUO assays enabling neurodegenerative disease research,\" said Kathleen Orland, Senior Vice President, General Manager, Clinical Chemistry and Immunoassay for Beckman Coulter Diagnostics. \"Availability of these assays on our automated, high throughput platforms will fundamentally change workflow, precision, and reliability of biomarker testing for neurodegenerative diseases. Our global install base opens new possibilities for multi-center collaborations to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these devastating conditions.\"\n\nTo effectively replace current testing modalities, blood-based biomarkers need to demonstrate concordance with amyloid PET and CSF tests.\n\np-Tau217 (phosphorylated Tau217) is a critical biomarker to detect tau and amyloid pathology. Tau and amyloid pathology refer to the abnormal accumulation of tau and amyloid beta proteins in the brain. Current evidence shows that plasma p-Tau217 is a sensitive biomarker present through all stages of AD and in research has shown to distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative disorders. Leveraging the ALZpath p-Tau217 antibody, the new Beckman Coulter Diagnostics assay enables researchers to detect p-Tau217 levels in plasma, providing insights into the formation of tau tangles.\n\nGFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) is a cytoskeletal, intermediate filament protein. While not AD specific, current evidence suggests that detection of increasing GFAP levels in plasma can be used to assess early stages of AD. Furthermore, GFAP may help distinguish AD dementia from other neurodegenerative diseases.i GFAP levels can also act as a marker for gliosis, a non-specific response to central nervous system damage, in response to neuronal damage from toxins or injury.\n\nNfL (Neurofilament Light Chain) is a key indicator of axonal damage and neurodegeneration, regardless of cause. Elevated levels of NfL in cerebrospinal fluid and blood are associated with several neurodegenerative conditions,ii including AD and Parkinson's disease, and may be used for predicting cognitive decline and monitoring treatment efficacy.\n\nAPOE \u03b54 (Apolipoprotein \u03b54) gene is the most significant genetic risk factor for developing AD. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' new APOE \u03b54 immunoassay offers > 99% concordance with PCR genotypingiii in only 20 minutes, allowing researchers to explore the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative disease risks and patient outcomes without having to resort to costly and time-consuming molecular diagnostics.\n\nThese neurogenerative RUO assays are all immediately available for use on the DxI 9000 Immunoassay Analyzer, featuring the proprietary Lumi-Phos PRO substrate that enables development of high-sensitive assays, to support evolving healthcare needs. Additionally, GFAP, NfL, and ApoE4 \u03b54 assays are also available for use on the Access 2 Immunoassay Analyzer.\n\nFor more information about these new RUO assays and how they can support your research, please visit www.beckmancoulter.com/neuro or contact our customer support team.

Lurcher, Walter, came into the care of the RSPCA\u2019s Danaher Animal Home , in Essex, in November 2022 when he was just a puppy, as part of a welfare investigation. It would end up being a long stay - 776 days long, in fact.\n\nRyan Lynch, from Danaher, said: \u201cWalter\u2019s journey was a long one. As he was part of an ongoing investigation, he couldn\u2019t be rehomed for some time. Once he could, he had lots of meet-and-greets but finding him the right match proved tricky and no one seemed to want him. Walter was such a joy to be around but we had lots of lurchers in our care at the time and I think he just went under the radar and was getting missed by potential adopters.\u201d\n\nWalter spent much of 2024 in a fabulous foster home where he learned how to live in a home and spent time with another resident dog, all helping to prepare him for a fresh start.\n\nREAD MORE:Colchester Zoo says farewell to two chimpanzees ahead of brand new arrival\n\nREAD MORE:The Essex town Nigel Farage says is \u2018depressed\u2019 and how he plans to change it\n\nRyan added: \u201cWe all loved him dearly and hoped that every inquiry we received would be \u2018the one\u2019 for him. Then, finally, just before Christmas, it happened, and he found his perfect home.\u201d Walter was adopted by Kelsey Jones and her partner, Paddy, and they picked him up to begin his new life on December 21 - just in time for Christmas in a new loving home.\n\nKelsey, from Manningtree, said: \u201cI grew up with a rescue lurcher from Danaher so when my partner and I decided we were ready for a dog it was the first place we went to look. We saw Walter\u2019s profile on the website and instantly fell in love with his pictures and videos. We went to meet him and knew right away that he was perfect for us. We were besotted.\n\n(Image: RSPCA)\n\n\u201cPaddy is really tall so they suited each other perfectly with their long legs! We had to have higher fencing put around our back garden so we got that sorted and then we were Walter-ready. He has only been here a short time but he\u2019s made us so happy already; he\u2019s got such a cheeky personality.\n\n\u201cWe had a quiet but magical Christmas with him and it was lovely to see him enjoying home comforts at last. We\u2019ve taken him for his first trip to the beach and he has really started enjoying going in the car.\u201d",

There is much to look forward to. Thank you to everyone for your continued support.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the princess had made the returned to The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in Chelsea, west London, where she met medical teams and spoke to patients who are currently receiving treatment, Kensington Palace said.\n\nThe unannounced visit was her first solo engagement of the year as the royal continues a phased return to her public duties.\n\nCatherine, who is also known as Kate, stepped back from her public duties last year to undergo treatment for an unspecified cancer. In September, she announced that she had completed her chemotherapy, and said she was \u201cdoing what I can to stay cancer free.\u201d\n\nFollowing her poignant visit, Kate said on social media that she had \u201cwanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to The Royal Marsden for looking after me so well during the past year.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything. We couldn\u2019t have asked for more,\u201d she added. \u201cThe care and advice we have received throughout my time as a patient has been exceptional.\u201d\n\nA deeply personal visit\n\nDuring her visit on Tuesday, Kate also spent some time with fellow patients also undergoing treatment. According to Britain\u2019s PA Media news agency, the princess joked with one patient that she\u2019d grown \u201cattached\u201d to her medication port - a small device inserted under the skin to deliver chemotherapy drugs.\n\nSpeaking to dozens of patients at the hospital\u2019s Medical Day Unit, PA Media reported, Kate noted that chemo is \u201creally tough. It\u2019s such a shock.\u201d\n\nThe palace also announced Kate had become joint patron of the specialist cancer center, alongside her husband, Prince William.\n\nKensington Palace said that the princess had wanted to return to the hospital \u201cto both show her gratitude to the incredible team, but also highlight the world leading care and treatment the Marsden provides.\u201d\n\nPrince William last week praised his wife and mother of their three children as she celebrated her 43rd birthday, saying \u201cthe strength you\u2019ve shown over the last year has been remarkable.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Marsden was the world\u2019s first hospital dedicated to cancer diagnosis, treatment, research and education when it first opened in 1851. Today, the facility remains a world-leading cancer center.\n\nPrince William has held the role of president of the hospital since 2007, a role that previously belonged to his late mother, Diana.\n\nAs joint royal patron, it is understood that Kate will support the hospital\u2019s work in advancing cancer research, treatment and care as well as learning more about how it can benefit patients in the future. The royal said that she hoped that through her joint royal patronage that \u201cwe might save many more lives, and transform the experience of all those impacted by cancer.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s chief executive, Cally Palmer, said: \u201cWe are incredibly fortunate to receive Royal Patronage \u2013 it is inspiring for staff and patients and enables us to shine a light on the outstanding work our staff deliver every day for patients and their families.\u201d\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from those suggested or indicated by such forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things: unanticipated, further declines in demand for our COVID-19 related products, the impact of global health crises, the impact of our debt obligations on our operations and liquidity, deterioration of or instability in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets, uncertainties with respect to the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our business and products, uncertainties relating to national laws or policies, including laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition, contractions or growth rates and cyclicality of markets we serve, competition, our ability to develop and successfully market new products and technologies and expand into new markets, the potential for improper conduct by our employees, agents or business partners, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including rules relating to off-label marketing and other regulations relating to medical devices and the health care industry), the results of our clinical trials and perceptions thereof, our ability to effectively address cost reductions and other changes in the health care industry, our ability to successfully identify and consummate appropriate acquisitions and strategic investments, our ability to integrate the businesses we acquire and achieve the anticipated growth, synergies and other benefits of such acquisitions, contingent liabilities and other risks relating to acquisitions, investments, strategic relationships and divestitures (including tax-related and other contingent liabilities relating to past and future IPOs, split-offs or spin-offs), security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws, the impact of our restructuring activities on our ability to grow, risks relating to potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, currency exchange rates, tax audits and changes in our tax rate and income tax liabilities, changes in tax laws applicable to multinational companies, litigation and other contingent liabilities including intellectual property and environmental, health and safety matters, the rights of the United States government with respect to our production capacity in times of national emergency or with respect to intellectual property/production capacity developed using government funding, risks relating to product, service or software defects, product liability and recalls, risks relating to our manufacturing operations and fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies we use (including commodities) and labor we need for our operations, our relationships with and the performance of our channel partners, uncertainties relating to collaboration arrangements with third-parties, the impact of deregulation on demand for our products and services, the impact of climate change, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and our ability to address stakeholder expectations relating to climate change, labor matters and our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, non- U.S. economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors (including the impact of military conflicts), disruptions and other impacts relating to man-made and natural disasters, inflation and the impact of our By-law exclusive forum provisions.

Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation's (\"Danaher\" or the \"Company\") results that, when reconciled to sales growth, help our investors identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.\n\nManagement uses core sales growth to measure the Company's operating and financial performance, and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the Company's executive short-term cash incentive program.\n\nWith respect to this non-GAAP measure, we exclude (1) the impact of currency translation because it is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/danaher-ceo-to-comment-on-financial-performance-302349689.html\n\nSOURCE Danaher Corporation",

Believe it or not, there are many highly intelligent pro grapplers who have attended college and have earned degrees.\n\nHere is a list of 5 BJJ athletes who went to college. Check out theist of highly intelligent BJJ athlete below and use this custom term paper writing service for your next essay.\n\nEddie Cummings\n\nFirst up on our list of 5 BJJ athletes who went to college is former EBI champion Eddie Cummings. During the 2010s, Cummings was one of the top grapplers on the planet.\n\nEddie was also one of the most brilliant athletes to compete in the sport. Before getting into Jiu-Jitsu, Eddie was a physics major at Stony Brook University.\n\nHowever, Cummings\u2019s life trajectory changed when he moved to New York to enter a new program. He also began training at Renzo Gracie\u2019s school as a blue belt and dedicated his life to learning Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nTammi Musumeci\n\nMikey Musumeci is a Jiu-Jitsu savant, but he\u2019s not the smartest person in his family. That award goes to his sister Tammi Musumeci who is one of the top 5 BJJ athletes who went to college.\n\nTammi is a world champion grappler, who graduated with a law degree from William S. Boyd Law School in Nevada. Musumeci took a break from competing to finish her degree, but never stopped training.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised to see her on a UFC Fight Pass event with her brother in the future.\n\nGrace Gundrum\n\nDuring her teens, Grace Gundrum was one of the best professional grapplers in the world. She also later became one of the top 5 BJJ athletes who went to college.\n\nAfter dominating the mats throughout her teens, Grace went to Lehigh University and earned an engineer degree. She is now enjoying her new successful engineering career after being a tio Jiu-Jitsu athlete.\n\nGrace has made no announcements about competing again, but never say never.\n\nLachlan Giles\n\nLachlan Giles is considered one of the best leglockers to ever compete in professional grappling. He is also one of the top 5 BJJ athletes who went to college.\n\nWhile Lachlan was struggling to make his dreams on the mat come true, he also attended college. The ADCC medalist earned a PhD in physiotherapy from the University of Melbourne.\n\nGiles has translated his extensive educational background into becoming a world renowned Jiu-Jitsu coach.\n\nJohn Danaher\n\nA list of 5 BJJ athletes who went to college would not be complete without mentioning the wizard, John Danaher. The mentor of top BJJ athletes like Gordon Ryan and Nicholas Meregali is considered the sport\u2019s top intellectual.\n\nBefore Danaher began learning BJJ under Renzo Gracie, he was a student at Columbia University. John was in the PhD program at Columbia, which explains his approach to grappling.\n\nAny time you see Danaher coach, you can see his philosophical approach to teaching his top athletes.",

Although the competition team has existed for a little over 3 years at this point, they haven\u2019t actually had their own facility. The Danaher Death Squad split up in 2021 and it didn\u2019t take long at all for the two rival teams to emerge from the ashes. Although it only took a few days for Ryan to confirm who was going to stay with him, it was actually B-Team Jiu-Jitsu who acted first and set up their own physical location in Austin, Texas to train in.\n\nObviously John Danaher and the rest of the New Wave team had a lot on their plates when DDS first split up, and it made sense that they might have prioritised preparing for ADCC 2022 instead. It\u2019s been one thing after another after that major tournament, leading all the way up to the next edition of the event; ADCC 2024. That was an even more successful outing for the team, with several younger members reaching the podium for the very first time and Gordon Ryan winning both of his superfights. It seems as though that success has allowed the team to get back to finding a home academy to call their own.\n\nThere\u2019s no news on where exactly the team will be opening New Wave Jiu-Jitsu HQ in 2025, but Ryan confirmed that the location will be open to the public. Danaher is the team\u2019s coach and would obviously be teaching, but their official Instagram account also lists both Gordon Ryan and Garry Tonon as well. There will be no shortage of elite instruction available at the academy of course, as there are multiple world champions representing them. Giancarlo Bodoni is a two-time ADCC world champion and Nicholas Meregali has won an impressive three IBJJF world titles during his career, while other elite competitors like Luke Griffith and Helena Crevar could also have valuable input.\n\nGordon Ryan announced the news that New Wave Jiu-Jitsu HQ was opening in 2025 in a recent post to his official Instagram account, linking fans to the team\u2019s own account:",

            "content": "Let's talk about the popular Danaher Corporation ( ). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$274 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$226. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Danaher's current trading price of US$238 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Danaher\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Danaher?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Danaher seems to be fairly priced at around 16.46% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Danaher today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $204.45, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Danaher has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Danaher?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Danaher. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DHR\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock?

Their prevalence has never really been doubted but it\u2019s also been difficult to prove, as very few professional grappling promotions even test their athletes. However, the IBJJF introducing testing through USADA has resulted in several of the biggest names in the sport being caught over the years and even more recently, there\u2019s been a change in the culture where some competitors feel comfortable speaking more openly about their use.\n\nCraig Jones shared his stack with the world and Gordon Ryan has explained the reasons behind his use, with them being two of the sport\u2019s biggest stars. While there are obviously some competitors who choose to stay away from PEDs and some are even very vocally against them, Firas Zahabi echoed Jones and Ryan\u2019s statements when he discussed the topic:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t forget, even the most technical guys are on juice. Even the most. That\u2019s the crazy thing about the sport of Jiu-Jitsu. There are very few natural guys. There are very few in the elite level because they don\u2019t test, right? They don\u2019t test.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong either, there\u2019s only one organization conducting any testing and even then it is limited to the champions of a handful of events each year. Zahabi also explained that PEDs obviously do help competitors succeed, but they may not end up getting much more proficient in the technical aspect of the sport:\n\n\u201cYou have to differentiate between being effective and technical. If you\u2019re a blue belt and I jam you up with a bunch of steroids, you\u2019re going to become a purple belt in not long, not technically a purple belt, but because of added strength now you can compete with the purple belts.\u201d\n\nHe even takes it a step further and explains what happens when those same competitors end up opening an academy to teach:\n\n\u201cImagine there are a lot of instructors out there who take a lot of ster*ids\u2026 They don\u2019t understand technique because they\u2019re so strong they\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201d\n\nThe full interview with Firas Zahabi where he discusses PEDs in BJJ was uploaded to the official YouTube channel of Tristar Gym:",

(HPD), a subsidiary of FormFactor.\n\nDanaher Cryogenic's acquisition of HPD's ADR Cryogenics product line follows over 20 years of HPD's leading presence in the ADR cryogenic space. HPD's ADR cryostats have been deployed as the cryogenic workhorse to many world-class institutions, including NIST, NASA, INRiM, and national laboratories such as Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory, among many others.\n\n\"Danaher Cryogenics is proud to continue in the legacy of HPD, providing scientists and researchers with excellent cryogenic solutions that help advance astronomy, Quantum Computing, and many other critical fields,\" said Charlie Danaher, President and Founder of Danaher Cryogenics. \"We look forward to working with the scientists and researchers who use these versatile tools to perform exciting and important work.\"\n\nADR cryostats will serve as a strategic addition to Danaher Cryogenics' existing cryogenic product line-up, consisting of a family of sub-Kelvin cryostats that incorporate Chase Research Cryogenics sorption coolers and Leiden Cryogenics Dilution Refrigerators.\n\nADR cryostats offer users a convenient way to perform experiments at temperatures below 100 mK. This temperature range is useful for various fields, including astronomy, Quantum Computing, Material Research, and Condensed Matter Physics. A unique characteristic of ADR cryostats is their insensitivity to gravity. Where nearly all other sub-Kelvin coolers are sensitive to \u2013 and dependent upon \u2013 gravity, ADRs can operate effectively in any orientation.\n\nWhereas Danaher Cryo's Chase-based sub-Kelvin cryostats offer base temperatures in the range from 1 K down to 100 mK, and the Leiden Cryogenics Dilution Refrigerators offer ultralow temperatures near 10 mK, the addition of the ADRs \u2013 operating between 100 mK and 30 mK \u2013 fills this gap and allows Danaher Cryogenics to offer products covering the full sub-Kelvin temperature spectrum.\n\nCharlie Danaher said, \"By now covering the entire range of sub-Kelvin temperatures, Danaher Cryogenics is uniquely positioned for the next frontier in cryogenics.\"\n\nAbout Danaher Cryogenics\n\nDanaher Cryogenics pursues the near impossible with elegant, classic solutions to manifest optimal cryogenic performance from initial concept to fruition.

            "content": "\u201cI always pivot to medicine as an example of all the good [artificial intelligence (AI)] can do because almost everything it\u2019s going to do there is going to be good.\u201d \u2014Geoffrey Hinton (Nobel laureate)\n\nAs a prominent advocate for the greater adoption of AI across healthcare, renowned cardiologist Eric Topol, MD, opened Danaher\u2019s conference, \u201cAI-Driven Predictive R&D: From Promise to Practice,\u201d with this quote during his keynote presentation.\n\nDanaher\u2019s full-day summit, held on December 3 in San Francisco, brought together an impressive line-up of experts across Big Tech, academia, drug discovery, pharma, and healthcare to discuss the impact of AI to improve human health, from optimizing drug discovery pipelines to improving patient care. The event also positioned the industry to look ahead toward 2025, as the implementation of AI poses ongoing challenges in building ethical guidelines, driving trust and adoption, and more.\n\nTopol is the author of Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again, and the blog Ground Truths, which has nearly 140,000 subscribers. He presented an array of evidence showcasing the benefits of AI across healthcare, including but not limited to increasing diagnostic accuracy, automation to give clinicians the gift of time, and improving doctor-patient relationships by promoting empathy.\n\n\u201cYou hear the term \u2018precision medicine\u2019 all the time. Well, it\u2019s not very good precision medicine if you keep making the same mistake over and over again. It\u2019s really very precise but we need accuracy in medicine, which we don\u2019t have,\u201d emphasized Topol.\n\nApproximately 800,000 Americans die or are permanently impacted by diagnostic errors each year. Recent proof points show that AI-driven diagnostics can improve breast cancer detection using mammography screening and adenoma detection rate using colonoscopies.\n\nFrom regulatory hurdles to limitations in transparency, Topol sees ongoing resistance to change and encourages the medical community to embrace AI and its capabilities. \u201cThere is a dark side of AI. We don\u2019t have to go over confabulations, hallucinations, and misinformation. These are the things in medicine that are going to hold us back. We need to build trust so we can really get to implementation,\u201d said Topol.\n\nAI awakening\n\nIt is no secret that the AI revolution is moving fast. \u201cThe world suddenly woke up and said, \u2018My goodness, look at this thing! AI is here suddenly!\u2019 Except that it really wasn\u2019t all that sudden,\u201d explained Daphne Koller, PhD, CEO of insitro, during her keynote presentation. \u201cWe have actually been living on an exponential curve of technology transformation that has been going on for multiple decades.\u201d\n\nPrior to founding insitro, Koller was a professor in the department of computer science at Stanford University. She is also a co-founder of Coursera, the global open online education platform launched in 2012, which has partnered with some 300 universities and offers more than 7,000 courses across the sciences and humanities.\n\nIn an exponential curve, technological advancements only accelerate over time, a key principle that Koller encouraged the community to keep in mind when judging where AI is today and where it will take the industry in the coming years.\n\nAlong the same vein, Topol cited the 2022 launch of ChatGPT as the hallmark of a new AI era that leverages large datasets for generalizable applications. In the closing weeks of 2024, at least ten foundation models were published, including Evo for interpreting and generating genomic sequences at vast scale; the Human Cell Atlas, which provides 3D maps of cells in the body to connect genotype to phenotype; and the open source code release of AlphaFold 3, which expands the protein structure prediction algorithm to incorporate broader molecular interactions with ligands and nucleic acids.\n\nThe Nobel Prize had its \u201cAI moment\u201d this year, as John Hopfield, PhD, and Geoffrey Hinton, PhD, took home the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for foundational discoveries in neural networks that have enabled modern-day machine learning. Additionally, the experts behind AlphaFold, Demis Hassabis, PhD, and John Jumper, PhD, from Google DeepMind, won a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with structural biologist David Baker, PhD, at the University of Washington, who pioneered the rise of AI for protein design.\n\nAI in practice\n\n\u201cThe key to success is not in the AI itself. It is in the bidirectional integration of the AI and digital world with the physical world,\u201d said Martin Stumpe, PhD, chief AI officer at Danaher.\n\nFrom large chemical data for small-molecule drug discovery to the virtual cell, the flood of data across multiple biological scales, modalities, and clinical contexts has been one of the main transformational drivers both fueling AI advancements and posing new practical considerations.\n\n\u201cIf we think about AlphaFold, [protein structure prediction] was a very well-defined problem. How do we define that problem when we think about the virtual cell? What are the capabilities that we want those cells to do? Once we reach alignment, how can we possibly validate all of these different applications?\u201d posed Emma Lundberg, PhD, associate professor at Stanford University and the co-director of the Human Protein Atlas, which is based at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The program aims to map all the human proteins across cells, tissues, and organs by integrating various omics technologies.\n\nFrom the academic perspective, Lundberg encouraged the virtual cell community to be strategic about collaboration. \u201cHow do we build from each other\u2019s work and create a global collaborative framework? Ensuring that people run in the same direction and create synergy is a big barrier right now,\u201d she said.\n\nRegina Barzilay, PhD, a distinguished professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), studies the deployment of AI algorithms in clinical settings. She argues that many of the safety mechanisms that exist in other industries do not exist in AI, which is particularly troublesome because we\u2019re moving to the next generation of tools where humans cannot validate the predictions.\n\n\u201cAI should be monitoring AI. These types of technologies still need to be developed to ensure that we can do safe care delivery,\u201d said Barzilay.\n\nMoving to drug discovery, the AI data boom has caused a paradigm shift from building on known targets from the literature to massive searches across biology for novel targets, a movement that is touted to improve R&D efficiency.\n\n\u201cYou cannot afford not to adopt [AI]. This technology affords so much speed up, that if you ignore it, competitors can completely change the market on you,\u201d said Usama Fayyad, PhD, executive director of the Institute for Experimental AI at Northeastern University.\n\nLast October, Recursion, one of the more established AI in drug discovery companies founded in 2013, announced the investigational new drug (IND) approval of REC-1245, a new chemical entity for the treatment of biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma. Recursion, whose combination with U.K.-based Exscientia was approved in November 2024, stated that REC-1245 is the first program to use the company\u2019s end-to-end AI platform and progressed from target identification to preclinical candidate in less than 18 months, nearly twice the speed of the industry average.\n\nWhile proof points are starting to come in for timeline compression in discovery, success rates in the clinic remain at a low 10%. \u201cI worry that we\u2019re becoming more efficient at making medicines that fail in the clinic. The big challenge is still the translation challenge,\u201d said Steve Crossan, founder of Dayhoff Labs and one of the founding DeepMind contributors of AlphaFold 1.\n\nCrossan highlighted prior studies that showed that 70% of drugs in the clinic were working through off-target effects, indicating an ongoing gap in our goal of targeted therapeutic mechanisms.\n\nNajat Khan, PhD, chief R&D officer and chief commercial officer at Recursion, emphasized the role of big data in understanding disease biology. \u201cThe challenge is unlike physician notes or the climate where we have a ton of data, we understand 10\u201315% of biology at best. There\u2019s so much gap,\u201d said Khan. \u201cThink about it as a map with tons of gaps. You have to generate the data to increase the odds of success.\u201d\n\nKoller echoed this sentiment and attributes most failures to the early stages of the decision-making process. \u201cWe are very poor at selecting the right therapeutic hypotheses, the right targets to modulate, and the right patient population,\u201d she said.\n\nTo improve drug discovery\u2019s promise, Koller leverages support from human genetics to inform drug targets at insitro, noting that a recent study published in Nature documented the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support to be 2.6 times greater than those without.\n\nWhile drug discovery pipelines continue to advance, Khan urged the community to maintain momentum while managing expectations. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hype and things that haven\u2019t worked. A lot of people walk away. Is it going to be right the first time? No. If our success rate is 10%, you can\u2019t expect 100%,\u201d said Khan.\n\n\u201cI love what Eric Topol said, which is \u2018embrace it!\u2019 Because if you embrace it, then you say [AI] is a \u2018must-have.\u2019 There\u2019s no option not to try,\u201d Khan continued.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the exponential part of a technology curve, it\u2019s very easy to forget that the thing that doesn\u2019t work today will work tomorrow\u2014literally tomorrow,\u201d weighed in Crossan.\n\nTaken together, Hinton\u2019s words ring true as AI\u2019s promise continues to provide increasing benefits across healthcare. As technology accelerates, the industry will watch as strategy, expectations, and acceptance evolve to keep up.",

            "content": "Investors often hold blue-chip stocks at the core of their portfolios. That makes sense. After all, blue-chip companies are leaders in their industries. Their names are familiar to investors.\n\nWhat are blue-chip stocks?\n\nBlue-chip stocks are from companies that are large, well-established, and financially sound. These companies have strong brand names and reputations, and they generate dependable earnings. Blue-chip companies usually boast consistent dividends and are often considered to be less risky, given their financial stability.\n\nHowever, investors may differ in how they define blue-chip companies. Some investors demand that a blue-chip stock be included in a particular index, such as the ASX 20 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Others may only include dividend-paying companies on their lists of blue-chip stocks. Still others may have specific market-capitalisation thresholds for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe companies on Morningstar\u2019s list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term share a few qualities:\n\nThe stocks are from companies included on Morningstar\u2019s list of the Best Companies to Own for 2024. Companies on this list have wide Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings (see end of article for definitions) and predictable cash flows, and they are run by management teams that make smart capital allocation decisions.\n\nThese stocks look undervalued, which means they\u2019re trading below Morningstar\u2019s fair value estimates.\n\nTheir market caps top $100 billion.\n\n10 best US blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term\n\nThese are the largest firms by market cap on Morningstar\u2019s Best Companies to Own list whose stocks were at least 14% undervalued as of 6 January 2025.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev BUD Pfizer PFE Roche RHHBY Nike NKE Nestle NSRGY Sanofi SNY Danaher DHR Merck MRK Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY\n\nHere\u2019s a little bit about each of these blue-chip stocks for the long term.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev BUD\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $105 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.55\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 1.66%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Beverages\u2014Brewers\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev is the most undervalued company on our list of best blue-chip stocks to buy. It has built a vast global scale and regional density through past acquisitions like Grupo Modelo and SABMiller. The brewer\u2019s strategy is to buy brands with a promising growth platform, expand distribution, and ruthlessly squeeze costs from the business, observes Morningstar analyst Verushka Shetty. \u201cAB InBev has one of the strongest cost advantages in our consumer defensive coverage and is among the most efficient operators,\u201d she adds. The brewer\u2019s free cash flow conversion has been consistently higher than peers\u2019 in recent years, but it needs to continue to deleverage its balance sheet to reduce its earnings volatility. AB InBev stock trades 45% below our fair value estimate of $90 per share.\n\nPfizer PFE\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $143 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.60\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 6.65%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nPfizer is the first of seven healthcare companies that made our list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy, and it offers the highest trailing yield of the group. A household name among drug manufacturers, Pfizer\u2019s stock is currently trading at a 40% discount to its fair value estimate. The firm has strong cash flows generated from a basket of diverse drugs, says Morningstar strategist Karen Andersen. Further, the company\u2019s large size confers significant competitive advantages in developing new drugs. We expect steady growth until 2028 when patent losses will likely increase, but pipeline advancements hold the potential to mitigate pressures. We think Pfizer stock is worth $42 per share.\n\nRoche RHHBY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $231 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.64\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.80%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nRoche stock trades 36% below our fair value estimate of $55 per share. The company\u2018s drug portfolio and industry-leading diagnostics provide significant competitive advantages and underpin our wide economic moat rating, says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. \u201cThis Swiss healthcare giant is in a unique position to guide healthcare into a safer, more personalised, and more cost-effective endeavour,\u201d she notes. With its biologics focus and innovative pipeline, we expect Roche to continue to achieve growth as its blockbuster drugs face competition.\n\nNike NKE\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $115 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.66\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 1.96%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Footwear and Accessories\n\nNike is one of only three nonhealthcare companies on our list of best blue-chip stocks. The largest athletic footwear brand in all major categories and all major markets, Nike dominates categories like running and basketball with popular shoe styles. We view Nike as the leader of the athletic apparel market and believe it will overcome current challenges, such as uneven demand for sportswear in key markets, argues Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz. Nike\u2019s consumer plan is led by its Triple Double strategy to double innovation, speed, and direct connections to consumers. Although its recovery in China has been slow due to economic conditions, native competition, and a political controversy, we still believe Nike has a great opportunity for revenue growth there and in other emerging markets. Nike stock trades at a 34% discount to our fair value estimate of $117 per share.\n\nNestle NSRGY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $215 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.71\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.96%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Packaged Foods\n\nNestle is the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the world by sales. Its diverse product portfolio includes brands such as Nestle, Nescafe, Perrier, Pure Life, and Purina. Nestle faces competition from local operators, and past missteps have caused the firm to miss out on or be late to the latest consumer trends. However, current management has reversed past trends, says Morningstar analyst Diana Radu. Aside from structural cost-cutting efforts, the management team has successfully put a lot of weight on reinvigorating growth through active portfolio management, resetting legacy businesses, and further investment in high-growth categories (coffee, pet care, water, and nutrition). Nestle stock trades 29% below our fair value estimate of $116 per share.\n\nSanofi SNY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $117 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.77\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 4.44%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nSanofi\u2019s wide lineup of branded drugs and vaccines and robust pipeline create strong cash flows and a wide economic moat. Growth of existing products and new product launches should help offset upcoming patent losses, says Morningstar senior analyst Jay Lee. Sanofi\u2019s existing product line boasts several top-tier drugs, including immunology drug Dupixent. A history of acquisitions and robust cash flow from operations mean Sanofi could take advantage of further growth opportunities through external collaborations. We expect the firm\u2019s acquisition focus on immunology drugs and rare disease drugs will continue following several deals in this area. Sanofi stock trades 23% below our fair value estimate of $63 per share.\n\nDanaher DHR\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $169 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.83\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 0.45%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Diagnostics and Research\n\nMedical technology company Danaher joins our list of best blue-chip stocks to buy after Morningstar analysts upgraded the firm\u2019s moat rating to wide from narrow. The firm offers differentiated technology that is protected by various intangible assets, including patents, brands, copyrights, and trademarks, observes Morningstar senior analyst Julie Utterback. Danaher seeks out attractive markets and makes acquisitions to enter or expand within those fields, and it also divests assets that are no longer core to the business. The company\u2019s acquisition-focused strategy has contributed to it becoming a top-five player in the highly fragmented and relatively sticky life science and diagnostic tool markets. Danaher stock trades at an 17% discount to our fair value estimate of $285 per share.\n\nMerck MRK\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $253 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.83\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.12%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nMerck\u2019s combination of a wide lineup of high-margin drugs and a pipeline of new drugs should ensure strong returns on invested capital over the long term, says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. After several years of mixed results, Merck\u2019s R&D productivity is improving as the company shifts more toward areas of unmet medical need. Merck\u2019s new products have mitigated the generic competition, offsetting recent major patent losses. In particular, Keytruda for cancer represents a key blockbuster with multi-billion-dollar potential. We expect Keytruda\u2019s leadership in non-small cell lung cancer and several other cancers will be a key driver of growth for the firm over the next several years, but the 2028 US patent loss on the drug will create eventual pressure. Merck stock is trading 17% below our fair value estimate of $120 per share.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific TMO\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $203 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.85\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 0.29%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Diagnostics and Research\n\nThermo Fisher is weathering the pullback in global biopharmaceutical spending better than most of its peers. Being the premier life science supplier and having an unmatched portfolio of products, resources, and manufacturing capabilities have allowed the firm to retain and grow its wallet share among its customers across all channels, observes Morningstar regional director Alex Morozov. We expect the current budget-constrained environment to slowly ease in the upcoming year. The firm remains in a great position to leverage its share gains in the biopharma channel and capitalize on strong long-term demand. Thermo Fisher stock is trading at a 15% discount to its fair value estimate of $630.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb BMY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $113 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.86\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 4.30%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nRounding out our list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock is trading 14% below our fair value estimate of $66 per share. Adept at partnerships and acquisitions, Bristol-Myers Squibb has built a strong portfolio of drugs and a robust pipeline. The firm has brought in partners to share the development costs and diversify the risks of clinical and regulatory failure. \u201cWe believe the cardiovascular partnership with Pfizer represents one of the most important partnerships,\u201d says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. Bristol is aggressively repositioning itself to expand through challenging patent losses. The recent approval of Karuna\u2019s schizophrenia drug Cobenfy stands to generate multi-billion-dollar peak sales in neurology, which is now reestablished as a key focus for Bristol.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years.

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Danaher (DHR), which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this industrial and medical device maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 9.58%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Danaher was expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share, but it reported $1.71 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.62%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.57 per share, while it actually produced $1.72 per share, a surprise of 9.55%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Danaher. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nDanaher has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

Jack Danaher Molloy, 24, a former resident of Pittsburgh, attempted to provide material support and resources to the terrorist group from August 2024 through December 2024, in Lebanon, Syria, the Western District of Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, the Justice Department said in a statement.

He also expressed his hatred toward, and promoted violence against, Jewish people,\" documents show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Molloy's alleged animus toward Jews was also evidenced by multiple images and videos on his electronic devices and the usernames he chose for his social media and email accounts, including the username \"KIKEKILLER313\" on the social media platform X.

            "content": "In each of the past 17 Decembers I have selected and invested personally in 10 of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top Ten for 2025, listed in random order. As with last year's list, this year leans to be perhaps a bit more defensive than in years past. Astute observers who have tracked my picks over the years may also note that the price-to-earnings multiples tend to be larger on this year's list than on ones past. That is largely an artifact of the markets as a whole trading at multiples above historical averages. The Top Ten for 2025 consists of companies with fortress balance sheets, downside protection and upside opportunities. See Farr's list of the top 10 stocks for 2044 Farr, Miller and Washington is a \"buy-to-hold\" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of at least 3 to 5 years. The Top Ten list is a thought experiment, actively testing which stocks within our discipline will perform the best over the course of the next 12 months. It does not represent a complete equity portfolio, much less a complete investment portfolio; it is not a recommendation to buy or sell; it is a sample of what I am invested in across the breadth of my, my family's, holdings. I will sell the names on the 2024 list on Dec. 31 and buy the 2025 names that afternoon. The reader should not assume that an investment in the securities identified was or will be profitable. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. If you are interested in any of these names, please call your financial advisor to discuss. With these disclaimers and qualifiers in place, here is the Top Ten list for 2025. I hope it will give you some insight into our decision- making process on investing. Donaldson (DCI) Founded in 1915, Donaldson is a global manufacturer of filtration systems and replacement parts for engines (on- and off-road trucks and heavy machinery for the transportation, construction, agriculture, and mining industries), industrial plants, power generation and various life sciences applications (bioprocessing, food and beverage, medical device, vehicle electrification, microelectronics and disk drives). DCI YTD line Donaldson performance Management runs the business for the LONG TERM, and so it has continued and will continue to invest in R & D and bolt-on acquisitions at the cost of some near-term profitability. However, the company's balance sheet is very strong and free cash flow generally approaches net income on an annual basis. Lastly, the company has increased its dividend every year for the past 26 years, with the dividend increasing at a 13% rate since 2000. The stock trades at just 18x forward EPS, which is an 18% discount to the S & P 500 compared to an historical average of about a 24% premium. Valmont Industries (VMI) Valmont Industries is a relatively small company ($6.2 billion market cap) that manufactures engineered poles, towers and other structures for a number of different applications, including roads and highway safety, energy transmission, telecommunications, and access systems for construction sites. The company also produces mechanized irrigation systems and metal coatings for its own products as well as those of third-party customers. VMI YTD line Valmont year to date Despite our expectation of slower economic growth and a downturn in the North American agriculture sector, we see no change in the world's need to continue investing in infrastructure, energy and agriculture. At about 17.3x forward EPS, we believe that patient investors could be well rewarded over time as investment spending continues. The company also offers a strong balance sheet and cash flow and a dividend yield of a bit under 1%. Danaher (DHR) Following the separation of its Environmental and Applied Solutions businesses on Sept. 30, 2023, Danaher became a pure-play biotechnology, life sciences and diagnostics company. The company's evolution to its current state occurred through a long series of acquisitions and divestitures designed to generate shareholder value through the application of the company's proprietary set of operating processes and tools it refers to as the Danaher Business System, or \"DBS.\" DHR YTD line Danaher year to date The company's current set of businesses is characterized by a high level of recurring revenue, primarily through a direct sales model, and to a geographically diverse customer base. Its high-growth end markets, recurring revenue, strong free cash flow generation and excellent track record all contribute to a stock that is rarely cheap. However, its current P/E multiple of 27.6x forward EPS is not too far out-of-line with its peer group even though its current business mix should offer better growth prospects. Amazon.com (AMZN) Amazon is a leading player in three businesses that are supported by strong secular tailwinds: cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital advertising. Perhaps more importantly, each of these businesses possesses a wide economic moat. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the market leader in cloud infrastructure services, enjoys strong customer loyalty and benefits from high switching costs. Although AWS growth decelerated during the 2022 slowdown in the technology sector, the segment has recently seen an uptick in demand owing to renewed cloud migration efforts and new Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads. AMZN YTD line Amazon year to date After more than two decades of non-stop reinvestment, AMZN is now a well-oiled machine, generating significant earnings and free cash flow. But while investments will remain elevated in the coming years, improved margins across the company should enable AMZN to compound earnings at a 15-20% annual clip. The stock isn't cheap at 36.2x forward EPS, but premium growth often demands a premium earnings multiple. Finally, the company has an excellent balance sheet with a debt rating of AA (S & P) and negligible net debt (debt net of cash). Becton, Dickinson & Co (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs. Management estimates that 90% of patients who enter an acute care setting interact with at least one BDX product. Becton has faced a variety of company-specific headwinds in recent years that were exacerbated by the pandemic. However, most of these challenges are now behind them, and the company has made progress on initiatives aimed at streamlining its operations and supply chain. As a result, BDX is on track to return to its pre-COVID operating margins within the next 12 months. BDX YTD mountain Becton Dickinson year to date Moreover, the company has spent the past few years divesting its slower-growing businesses while pursuing several tuck-in acquisitions in higher-growth areas. Looking ahead, these efforts should allow BDX to consistently achieve its long-term growth algorithm of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth. BDX shares currently trade at 15.4x forward EPS \u2013 a significant discount to both the S & P 500 and its Medtech peers. The dividend yield is 1.8%. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft is one of the largest technology companies in the world. It has successfully pivoted from a Windows PC-first world to the cloud and is leading the way in generative Artificial Intelligence. The company is a strategic partner in enterprise digital transformations through its cloud, app and infrastructure, and artificial intelligence offerings. There is a long runway remaining for cloud growth as companies slowly deal with legacy investments that still drive value but are not cloud-based. MSFT is uniquely positioned to grow its wallet share of corporate IT budgets as it encounters new opportunities in security, compliance, and workflow. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft year to date Shares trade at 31x forward EPS, and we think earnings may grow in the low-to-mid teens over the next several years. The premium valuation is justified given the above-trend growth, exposure to secular trends, and strong balance sheet. Visa (V) Visa is one of the world's leading payments technology companies. It enables fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. The company continues to pursue its network-of-networks strategy, positioning it to be in the middle of everything as it connects networks across the globe. V YTD line Visa year to date Visa Direct is an example whereby the company enables account-to-account transfers using debit card credentials to enable all of the use cases just mentioned. Buy now-pay later has gained popularity, but up to 80% of those using such services pay off their balance using a debit or credit card, resulting in Visa revenue being as much as or greater than if the network had been used for the initial purchase. The company's balance sheet is solid. Shares trade at 27.5x forward EPS and a 16% discount to Mastercard, which seems unwarranted. We expect EPS to grow in the double digits over the next several years. Alphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet is a holding company that owns several subsidiaries, with the most visible and profitable being the internet services giant Google. Google search is the world's most popular search engine, and Android is the most widely used mobile phone operating software. Moreover, the company has seven products and platforms with more than two billion users \u2013 search, Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, Google Play Store, and Android. GOOGL YTD line Alphabet year to date Advertising dollars continue to shift to digital formats, and we think the company will be a leader in advancing Gen AI and integrating it into its products and services. The company has arguably the best balance sheet in the world with more than $115 billion in cash and investments (net of debt). Shares trade at about 22x forward EPS with double-digit earnings growth. There are risks around government regulation, but we see those developments taking years to play out. Adobe (ADBE) Adobe is a software company that has distinguished itself over the decades as a leader in creativity and digital transformation. Its portfolio spans a wide range of tools \u2013 from software for graphic design, video editing, and web development to advanced solutions for digital experience management. Nearly all creative professionals rely on Adobe's Creative Cloud, and the industry is largely standardized around it. This provides the company with a wide moat and a large recurring subscription revenue stream. ADBE YTD line Adobe year to date Shares fell this month on guidance for the 2025 fiscal year that fell just shy of market expectations with growth tilted more towards new product introductions and new users as opposed to general pricing increases. The investor shortsightedness has the company trading at just 21.7x forward EPS for a company we think can grow earnings in the double digits over the next several years. Accenture (ACN) Accenture is a global leader in Information Technology (IT) services. The company's business is split roughly evenly between Strategy & Consulting and Managed Services. The Consulting unit is more economically sensitive while Managed Services is comprised of larger long-term contracts that come out of backlog much more slowly. ACN YTD line Accenture year to date The company estimates that just 5-10% of companies are mature enough with their data to benefit from Generative AI at scale. Shares of Accenture are rarely cheap, but we see value at 27.5x forward EPS given its positioning as a partner of choice for firms wanting to modernize their systems and benefit from AI advancements.",
