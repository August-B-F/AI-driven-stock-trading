            "content": "Dublin, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Esophageal Cancer Market\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe esophageal cancer market was valued at USD 1.3 billion in 2023, driven by robust research efforts aimed at discovering new treatment options and improving existing therapies across the 8 major markets. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% during the forecast period 2024-2032, reaching a market value of USD 2.8 billion by 2032.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress in treatment technologies, including immunotherapies, targeted drug therapies, and minimally invasive surgeries, is transforming patient outcomes. These innovations provide more effective and personalised treatment options, boosting market growth as healthcare providers adopt new approaches to treating oesophageal cancer.\n\nThe increased investment from governments, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions in cancer research is accelerating the discovery of novel therapies. This growing funding base is fostering innovation in the oesophageal cancer treatment landscape, with ongoing clinical trials and drug developments driving market growth.\n\nAwareness campaigns aimed at early detection of oesophageal cancer are helping to improve survival rates. As more individuals recognise the symptoms and seek treatment sooner, the demand for advanced diagnostic tools and early-stage treatment options is expected to increase significantly.\n\nIncreased healthcare spending globally, particularly in emerging economies, is leading to greater access to advanced cancer treatments. Governments and private healthcare providers are investing in improved facilities and cutting-edge treatment options, boosting the overall demand for oesophageal cancer therapies.\n\nEsophageal Cancer Market Competitive Landscape\n\n\n\nThe competitive landscape of the esophageal cancer market is shaped by leading pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, Inc., Novartis AG, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi SA, AbbVie Inc., and GSK plc. These companies are actively engaged in research and development efforts to introduce innovative therapies, particularly in immunotherapy and targeted drug therapy. Strategic collaborations, mergers, and acquisitions are common strategies employed to strengthen their market presence and expand product portfolios. Ongoing clinical trials and drug approvals are also key factors driving competition in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nChallenges\n\nLate Diagnosis: Oesophageal cancer is frequently diagnosed at a late stage when treatment options are limited, and the prognosis is poor. This late diagnosis is primarily due to the disease's subtle early symptoms, which often go unnoticed, hindering early intervention and leading to higher mortality rates.\n\nTherapeutic Resistance: Resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies is a common problem in oesophageal cancer management. Over time, patients may stop responding to these treatments, leading to disease progression and fewer available therapeutic options, which complicates long-term care.\n\nLack of Awareness in Developing Regions: In many developing countries, awareness of oesophageal cancer symptoms and risk factors is low. This lack of awareness leads to late-stage diagnoses, higher mortality rates, and reduced access to advanced treatment options, limiting market growth in these regions.\n\nSide Effects of Current Treatments: The side effects of oesophageal cancer treatments, such as severe fatigue, nausea, and compromised immune function, can be debilitating. These adverse effects often affect patient quality of life and may lead to discontinuation of treatment, presenting a major challenge in achieving long-term disease management.\n\nFuture Opportunities\n\nDevelopment of Personalised Therapies: The growing focus on personalised medicine presents a key opportunity in the oesophageal cancer market. Advances in genetic profiling and molecular diagnostics enable the development of targeted therapies tailored to individual patients, improving treatment efficacy, and reducing side effects, which is expected to drive demand.\n\nResearch into Combination Therapies: Research into combining therapies, such as immunotherapy with chemotherapy or radiation, is showing promising results. Combination approaches are believed to enhance treatment efficacy, reduce resistance to single therapies, and improve patient outcomes, offering new avenues for market growth.\n\nAdvances in Minimally Invasive Surgery: The growing adoption of minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as robotic surgery and laparoscopy, offers patients quicker recovery times and fewer complications. This advancement is expected to improve patient outcomes and increase the demand for surgical intervention in oesophageal cancer treatment.\n\nTechnological Innovations in Diagnostics: Emerging technologies in diagnostics, such as liquid biopsies and advanced imaging techniques, provide opportunities for earlier and more accurate detection of oesophageal cancer. These innovations enable clinicians to diagnose cancer at earlier stages, when it is more treatable, improving patient outcomes and expanding the market for diagnostic tools.\n\nEsophageal Cancer Market Trends\n\nThe esophageal cancer market is rapidly evolving, propelled by technological advancements and changing treatment approaches. As ongoing research uncovers new insights into the disease, several significant trends are emerging, shaping the future trajectory of this market.\n\nImmunotherapy is becoming an integral part of oesophageal cancer treatment, offering the potential to improve survival rates in advanced-stage patients. With ongoing research into new immunotherapeutic agents, this trend is likely to grow, providing more treatment options with fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy.\n\nTargeted therapies, designed to attack specific cancer cells without harming healthy tissues, are gaining traction in oesophageal cancer treatment. These therapies are becoming increasingly important as research identifies new molecular targets, leading to better outcomes and fewer side effects for patients.\n\nThe growing focus on early detection methods, such as endoscopic screening and biomarker testing, is expected to improve survival rates by diagnosing oesophageal cancer at earlier, more treatable stages. This trend is particularly evident in regions with high cancer screening rates, such as the United States and Europe.\n\nRobotic-assisted surgery is becoming more common in oesophageal cancer treatment due to its precision and ability to perform complex procedures with fewer complications. This trend is expected to expand as hospitals invest in robotic systems and surgeons receive specialised training.\n\nAs survival rates improve, there is a growing focus on treatments that enhance patients' quality of life. Palliative care, alongside advanced treatments that reduce the side effects of cancer therapies, is becoming an integral part of oesophageal cancer management, particularly in advanced-stage patients.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 250 Forecast Period 2024 - 2032 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.5 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2032 $2.8 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.5% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1 Preface\n\n1.1 Objectives of the Study\n\n1.2 Key Assumptions\n\n1.3 Report Coverage - Key Segmentation and Scope\n\n1.4 Research Methodology\n\n\n\n2 Executive Summary\n\n\n\n3 Esophageal Cancer Market Overview - 8 Major Markets\n\n3.1 Esophageal Cancer Market Historical Value (2017-2023)\n\n3.2 Esophageal Cancer Market Forecast Value (2024-2032)\n\n\n\n4 Vendor Positioning Analysis\n\n4.1 Key Vendors\n\n4.2 Prospective Leaders\n\n4.3 Niche Leaders\n\n4.4 Disruptors\n\n\n\n5 Esophageal Cancer Overview\n\n5.1 Guidelines and Stages\n\n5.2 Pathophysiology\n\n5.3 Screening and Diagnosis\n\n5.4 Treatment Pathway\n\n\n\n6 Patient Profile\n\n6.1 Patient Profile Overview\n\n6.2 Patient Psychology and Emotional Impact Factors\n\n6.3 Risk Assessment and Treatment Success Rate\n\n\n\n7 Esophageal Cancer Market - Epidemiology Scenario and Forecast - 8 Major Markets\n\n7.1 8MM Epidemiology Scenario Overview (2018-2034)\n\n7.1.1 Prevalence, by Country\n\n7.1.1.1 United States\n\n7.1.1.2 United Kingdom\n\n7.1.1.3 EU4\n\n7.1.1.4 India\n\n7.1.1.5 Japan\n\n7.1.2 Diagnosed Cases, by Country\n\n7.1.2.1 United States\n\n7.1.2.2 United Kingdom\n\n7.1.2.3 EU4\n\n7.1.2.4 India\n\n7.1.2.5 Japan\n\n7.1.3 Treatment Seeking Rate, by Country\n\n7.1.3.1 United States\n\n7.1.3.2 United Kingdom\n\n7.1.3.3 EU4\n\n7.1.3.4 India\n\n7.1.3.5 Japan\n\n\n\n8 Esophageal Cancer Market Landscape - 8 Major Markets\n\n8.1 Esophageal Cancer Market: Developers Landscape\n\n8.1.1 Analysis by Year of Establishment\n\n8.1.2 Analysis by Company Size\n\n8.1.3 Analysis by Region\n\n8.2 Esophageal Cancer Market: Product Landscape\n\n8.2.1 Analysis by Treatment Type\n\n8.2.2 Analysis by Cancer Type\n\n8.2.3 Analysis by Route of Administration\n\n\n\n9 Esophageal Cancer Market Challenges and Unmet Needs\n\n9.1 Treatment Pathway Challenges\n\n9.2 Compliance and Drop-Out Analysis\n\n9.3 Awareness and Prevention Gaps\n\n\n\n10 Cost of Treatment\n\n\n\n11 Esophageal Cancer Market Dynamics\n\n11.1 Market Drivers and Constraints\n\n11.2 SWOT Analysis\n\n11.3 PESTEL Analysis\n\n11.4 Porter's Five Forces Model\n\n11.5 Key Demand Indicators\n\n11.6 Key Price Indicators\n\n11.7 Industry Events, Initiatives, and Trends\n\n11.8 Value Chain Analysis\n\nSupplier Landscape\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical\n\nPfizer, Inc.\n\nNovartis AG\n\nAmgen Inc.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nEli Lily and Company\n\nSanofi SA\n\nAbbVie Inc\n\nGSK plc\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/ob4nj1\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

            "content": "Indiana-based pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is part of the race to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease worldwide. One of its drugs was recently approved in the United States. But the European Medicines Agency recommended against the approval of the drug on Thursday.\n\nKisunla, also known as donanemab, is a monthly Alzhemier's injection produced by Eli Lilly that treats mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stage due to early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.\n\nCompany research shows it slowed cognitive decline by up to 35%, and was approved for use in the U.S. last year.\n\nBut the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use, part of the European Medicines Agency, said the benefits of the treatment don't outweigh the potential side effects, like fatal brain swelling.\n\nThe clinical trial for Kisunla included over 1,700 people located in eight countries. Of that group, three people died, potentially from the treatment.\n\n\"In reaching its conclusion, the Agency acknowledged the unmet medical need for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and took into consideration the views of patients and healthcare professionals who shared their needs and experiences related to living with or treating the condition,\" the CHMP wrote in an overview of its opinion.\n\nIlya Yuffa, executive vice president and president of Lilly International wrote in a press release that the company remains \"confident in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment,\" which has also been approved in Great Britain, Japan and China.\n\n\"Europeans living with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones urgently need additional treatment options,\" Yuffa said. \"Today's disappointing CHMP opinion means they must keep waiting.\"\n\nRoughly 7 million Europeans live with Alzheimer's disease, with numbers estimated to increase to 14 million by 2030, according to the European Brain Council.\n\nIn the U.S., an estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older had Alzheimer's dementia in 2023, and research from the National Library of Medicine shows the number could increase to 13.8 million by 2060.\n\nTwo years ago the U.S. approved Leqembi, an Alzheimer's treatment developed by Biogen Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. and Eisai Co in Japan. It was initially rejected by CHMP in July 2024. But after a re-examination process, the committee later reversed its statement and recommended it last November.\n\nJoanne Pike, CEO and president of the Alzheimer's Association based in Chicago, Ill., hopes the EMA's committee will also reconsider its opinion on Kisunla.\n\n\"As the EMA did when they first delayed approval for another treatment, Leqembi, we expect the EMA will quickly reverse this decision,\" Pike said. \"It is a shame that the EMA is delaying access to a treatment that benefits people in the earliest stages.\"\n\nLilly International hopes a re-examination process will prompt the European Medicines Agency to reconsider its opinion.\n\nThe European Commission, an agency in charge of policy and international aid distribution, will provide the ultimate decision within 67 days of CHMP's opinion.\n\nSide Effects Public Media is a health reporting collaboration based at WFYI in Indianapolis. We partner with NPR stations across the Midwest and surrounding areas \u2014 including KBIA and KCUR in Missouri, Iowa Public Radio, Ideastream in Ohio and WFPL in Kentucky.\n\nCopyright 2025 Side Effects Public Media",

But there was an Easter egg that took the spotlight: the telehealth platform unexpectedly dropped it was offering \u201cbranded tirzepatide\u201d \u2014 in other words, Eli Lilly\u2019s blockbuster weight-loss drug, Zepbound \u2014 on its platform.\n\nInvestors, hungry for positive news about Hims & Hers\u2019 ability to sell GLP-1s, sent the stock up as much as 7% in intraday trading. Then it came right back down as they realized it wasn\u2019t the \u201cdeal\u201d or \u201cpartnership\u201d some initially thought it was.\n\nClearly there is some confusion. Here\u2019s what we know:\n\nHow did we get here? GLP-1 drugs are all the rage. They\u2019re really good at helping people lose weight and the companies that make them have made a ton of money selling them at really high prices.\n\nThere are currently two GLP-1s you need to know about. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, which is made by Novo Nordisk. Then there\u2019s tirzepetide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, which is made by Eli Lilly.\n\nThese drugs are so popular that they were in shortage for several years. This allowed companies like Hims & Hers to sell cheap compounded copies of them, giving them a bite of the GLP-1 revenue apple. But in February, the Food and Drug Administration declared that the shortage was over, limiting the ability of companies that aren\u2019t the patent holders of the drugs to sell them.\n\nHims & Hers investors are clearly antsy about where the company\u2019s weight-loss business is going amid the uncertainty, and Tuesday\u2019s announcement was supposed to help clear that up \u2014 until it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhat Tuesday\u2019s announcement is: Hims & Hers users can now get a prescription for Zepbound, just like they can for other branded medications on the platform. But the drug costs about $1,899 a month, according to the company\u2019s website. Since it\u2019s definitely not the cheapest way to get Zepbound, the value of having it on the platform may not be to get people on it, but to steer customers to its cheaper generic or compounded options.\n\nWhat it is not: a \u201cpartnership,\u201d like the ones Eli Lilly has with Hims & Hers\u2019 competitors. Patients on Ro, for example, can get branded vials of Zepbound on that platform, one of the cheapest options for getting it without insurance.\n\nTo be clear, Hims & Hers never said it had a partnership with Eli Lilly, nor did it mention the company even once in its announcement. Eli Lilly didn\u2019t issue a statement at all until it felt the need to set the record straight.\n\nWhat was missed: the company officially launched its generic liraglutide, which is an older and less effective GLP-1 developed by Novo Nordisk, at $299 a month. The company had previously said this was its move.",

            "content": "The company has a looming opportunity to grab the booming GLP-1 agonist market by the horns.\n\nPharmaceutical powerhouse Eli Lilly (LLY -2.40%) had a banner year in 2024. The company's sales surged 32% to over $45 billion on massive growth from its GLP-1 agonist products, Mounjaro for treating type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management. Due to this growth story, the stock has ripped off over 180% in gains over the past three years.\n\nLately, however, Eli Lilly's stock has cooled. Shares have been essentially flat since July 2024.\n\nThe market for GLP-1 agonists could be evolving, and Eli Lilly has a high-stakes opportunity to dominate it over the coming year. Where might Eli Lilly be in a year, and should investors buy the stock now?\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nEli Lilly's potential game changer in the GLP-1 agonist market\n\nThe market for GLP-1 agonists is red-hot. Some experts believe annual sales of the popular drugs will grow to $150 billion by 2030 -- these weight loss drugs work by slowing digestion in the body and suppressing appetite. GLP-1 agonists are primarily approved and used to treat type 2 diabetes and chronic obesity. In addition, some patients are taking them to treat sleep apnea and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nToday, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dominate the GLP-1 agonist market. Based on Novo Nordisk's estimates, Eli Lilly's market share is approximately 34%.\n\nHowever, that could change. The leading GLP-1 agonist products, Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy (semaglutide) and Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound (tirzepatide), are administered via injections. Eli Lilly is working on a new drug, orforglipron, an oral tablet taken once daily, with no dietary restrictions. It's in clinical trials, seeking approval to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. Eli Lilly is expected to release late-stage trial data this year, and, assuming success, the FDA could approve the drug by the end of 2026.\n\nFor most patients, an oral tablet is far more convenient than injections. If Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1 agonist spends meaningful time on the market as the only approved oral drug, it could significantly shift market share. Pfizer is also working on an oral GLP-1 agonist but could be a year behind in development.\n\nEli Lilly's total sales between Mounjaro and Zepbound were slightly under $16.5 billion in 2024. If Eli Lilly increases its share in this ballooning industry, there is an opportunity for tremendous growth over the next five years.\n\nWeighing the company's fundamentals versus the stock price\n\nThe stock's plateau since the summer has given the business time to burn off an expensive valuation. Eli Lilly's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped from 130 to about 70. At the same time, analysts have lowered their growth expectations, which offsets some of the valuation decline.\n\nToday, the stock's P/E ratio and long-term estimated earnings growth rate translates to a PEG ratio of approximately 2.5. That's the maximum valuation I generally pay for high-quality stocks, and I prefer to buy lower.\n\nThe market tends to look to the future, so these estimates likely include continued momentum from Eli Lilly's GLP-1 agonists, including presumed FDA clearance for orforglipron.\n\nWhere will Eli Lilly be in a year?\n\nThe stock's price action over the next year could depend on orforglipron's upcoming trial data readout. Eli Lilly's business spans beyond GLP-1 agonists, but it could be the first company to sell an oral GLP-1 agonist, so investors are watching that.\n\nEli Lilly's hefty valuation signals that the market expects positive news from the trials, which limits the stock's short-term upside. Assuming all goes well, I don't think Eli Lilly's stock price will dramatically differ a year from now. The business could continue growing, steadily bringing the stock's valuation down to a more attractive level.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a risk of dramatic declines if orforglipron doesn't perform well. The market aggressively sold off Novo Nordisk recently after its upcoming drug, cagrisema, passed its trial but with underwhelming efficacy. Today, Novo Nordisk stock trades at a hefty discount to Eli Lilly.\n\nIt's hard to call a stock a buy when there is more risk than potential reward. Therefore, investors should hold off on Eli Lilly until the stock price declines further or the company makes it through the orforglipron trials without any negative surprises.",

            "content": "In the first quarter of 2025, healthcare stocks were among the strongest performers in the S&P index, outpacing the broader market. This marks a sharp contrast to their struggles in recent years. In 2024, the healthcare sector saw a modest gain of 2.06%, trailing the market's 25.02% return. A similar pattern was seen in 2023, with healthcare stocks rising just 2% while the overall market climbed 26%. Despite these challenges, healthcare remains a vital part of the economy, driven by increasing demand for medical products and services as the population ages. It is the fourth largest sector in the market, following technology, financials, and consumer discretionary. In the Russell MidCap Index, which tracks about 800 companies, healthcare ranks fifth, while in the small-cap Russell Index, it holds the third spot behind industrials and financials. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for US Bank Asset Management, said :\n\nAdditionally, companies specializing in life sciences tools and services faced lower demand, as COVID-19 testing declined and pandemic-related inventory levels were still being reduced. Policy concerns also weighed on the sector, particularly for insurers offering Medicare Advantage plans, as reimbursement rates fell short. Uncertainty surrounding upcoming elections further contributed to the healthcare sector\u2019s struggles. On a positive note, innovation remained strong, as the biotech industry saw promising clinical developments, and advancements in treatments for conditions like obesity and diabetes fueled significant growth in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nHealthcare stocks experienced a challenging year in 2024, lagging behind high-growth sectors like tech and AI. Market uncertainties and policy challenges also created obstacles for certain segments within the industry. In the first half of the year, investors focused on technology and communication services, drawing attention away from healthcare. While the sector showed some improvement in the latter half as the market rally expanded, certain segments continued to struggle with supply and demand imbalances caused by the pandemic. One major factor was the increased demand for delayed medical procedures, as patients sought treatments they had postponed. This benefited healthcare facilities and medical device manufacturers but put financial pressure on managed-care insurers.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best healthcare stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cInvestors can gain exposure to the healthcare sector by owning the S&P 500 through a passively managed index fund or ETF. Investors may also want to take a more selective approach, as the record demonstrates there can be varied performance within the healthcare sector.\u201d\n\nInvestors are taking a cautious approach as they assess potential policy shifts under the new administration. With a change in leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services, major healthcare companies could face greater scrutiny and may need to adjust to evolving policies.\n\nAs the Trump administration's policies come into focus, concerns are emerging over potential budget cuts that could directly affect healthcare organizations. With the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with cutting $1 trillion from a $6 trillion budget, reductions in healthcare spending appear likely. On January 17, the House Ways and Means Committee released a list of possible cuts to support the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Among the proposals are eliminating the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds and potentially revoking the nonprofit status of hospitals and health systems. At the same time, hospital mergers and acquisitions have been steadily rebounding from pandemic-era lows, despite strict federal antitrust policies. However, it remains to be seen how future changes in regulatory leadership might influence M&A activity.\n\nDespite policy concerns, some billionaire investors remain confident in the healthcare sector\u2019s future. Carl Cook, with an estimated net worth of $10.3 billion, is among the wealthiest figures in the healthcare industry. He took over as CEO of his family's medical device company in 2011 following his father's death. In 2017, the company sold one of its subsidiaries to a drug delivery technology firm for $950 million. Cook also serves as president of a life sciences division focused on developing a cell therapy for urinary incontinence. Another billionaire investor in the healthcare sector is Ronda Stryker, with a net worth of $8.4 billion.

The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors. We have also mentioned the value of billionaire holdings for further insight.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 23\n\nValue of Billionaire Holdings: $13.7 billion\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), a global pharmaceutical company based in Indianapolis, develops and markets medications across the US, Europe, Japan, China, and other regions. On February 26, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest at least $27 billion in building four new manufacturing facilities in the United States to meet the growing demand for its weight loss and diabetes treatments while also advancing new drug development.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) had a strong year in 2024, with annual revenue rising 32% from the previous year, surpassing its initial guidance by $4 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, revenue grew by 45%, driven by the success of newly launched products, which contributed over $3.1 billion, led by the rapid adoption of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Eli Lilly also saw solid growth in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience, while revenue from its non-incretin portfolio increased by 20%. Gross margin improved to 83.2% in the fourth quarter due to a favorable product mix. Research and development expenses rose by 18% due to investments in early and late-stage projects. Operating income more than doubled, reaching $5.6 billion, fueled by strong sales from new products.\n\nOn February 28, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced that the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended approval of Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib), a reversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The treatment is intended for adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have previously received a BTK inhibitor. The recommendation now awaits the European Commission\u2019s final review, which, if favorable, could serve as a significant catalyst for LLY.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 1st on our list of the best healthcare stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The lawsuits, filed in federal district courts in New Jersey and Delaware, target Empower Pharmacy and Strive Pharmacy, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEli Lilly accuses the companies of selling drugs that are not clinically tested nor approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company also alleges that the pharmacies falsely advertise their products as personalized while mass-producing them \u201cunder the false premise that they are tailor-made for each patient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFDA and a federal court have both made clear that compounders \u2018must cease production\u2019 of compounded tirzepatide knockoffs, and anyone continuing to sell mass compounded tirzepatide, including by referring to it as \u2018personalized,\u2019 \u2018tailored\u2019 or something similar, is breaking the law and deceiving patients,\u201d a Lilly spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. \u201cWe will continue to take action to stop these illegal actors and urgently call on regulators and law enforcement to do the same.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Strive Pharmacy\u2019s co-founders, Nate Hill and Mike Walker, strongly pushed back against Lilly\u2019s lawsuit, framing it as a broader attack on personalized medicine.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an attack on Strive Pharmacy, this is an attack on personalized medicine, patient access, patient choice, and healthcare provider discretion,\u201d Hill and Walker said in a statement. \u201cThis is a classic example of Big Pharma overstepping legitimate regulations and prioritizing their own interests over patients\u2019, and the general public is catching on.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShaun Noorian, the founder and CEO of Empower Pharmacy, echoed similar concerns, arguing that compounding plays a crucial role in expanding access to medications.\n\n\u201cPatients deserve to know they have choices when it comes to their healthcare, and compounding plays a vital role in expanding access to those options,\u201d Noorian said in a statement. \u201cRestricting access to personalized alternatives to commercial drugs is not in the best interest of patients, which is why we remain committed to offering these life-changing formulations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent FDA decisions have reshaped the market for compounded, or off-brand, versions of GLP-1 drugs like tirzepatide. Compounding typically involves modifying FDA-approved drugs to meet individual patient needs \u2014 such as altering dosages, changing administration methods, or removing allergens. While the FDA generally prohibits compounding drugs that are identical to commercially available medications, an exception is made when a drug is in shortage.\n\nThat regulatory loophole has proven lucrative for compounding pharmacies. For example, the telehealth platform Hims & Hers began offering compounded semaglutide \u2014 an off-brand version of Ozempic \u2014 last May. The company\u2019s total revenue surged 69% last year, reaching $1.5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) \u2014 a trade group representing compounding pharmacies \u2014 has sued the FDA twice over its decisions to remove tirzepatide and then semaglutide from its drug shortage list. The group argues that shortages persist and that the FDA\u2019s decision will harm patients by restricting access to more affordable alternatives.\n\nA judge recently ruled in favor of the FDA in the tirzepatide case, and the agency has since clarified its stance on compounded GLP-1 drugs. The FDA said it would begin enforcing regulations against outsourcing facilities producing compounded tirzepatide as soon as March 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEli Lilly has maintained that compounded versions of their medications are unsafe. However, it has strong financial incentive to curb sales of compounded GLP-1s.\n\nSince the FDA approved Zepbound in November 2023, Eli Lilly\u2019s stock has soared more than 40%, pushing its market capitalization above $700 billion.",

The industry producing copycats is estimated to exceed $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nCompounded tirzepatide can be purchased for a few hundred dollars, while Lilly\u2019s list price for its injections typically costs around $1,000 a month. The company in February reduced the cost of its 2.5 milligram and 5 milligram Zepbound vials to $349 and $499 a month, ramping up the fight against cheaper, copycat versions of the drug.\n\nThe lawsuits, which are set to be filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware and the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, claim that two compounding pharmacies offer custom-made, personalized tirzepatide products that haven\u2019t been approved for safety and effectiveness. The challenges targeted Strive Pharmacy LLC and Empower Clinic Services LLC.\n\nThe compounding pharmacies say their products are customized for individual consumers and are better suited for patients, according to the lawsuits reviewed by Bloomberg Law.\n\nThe cease-and-desist letters emphasized the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s declaration last year that Lilly\u2019s tirzpeatide shortage is over, and therefore they cannot legally regularly compound the medicine. Lilly asks the compounders to confirm by April 8 that they ceased the manufacture, production, dispensing, promotion, and sale of all forms of compounded tirzepatide.\n\nThe company says they have now had approximately six months to help patients transition from compounded tirzepatide to FDA-approved medicines.\n\n\u201cThere is zero clinical evidence supporting such manipulations, and the sale of these products remains both illegal and misleading to patients,\u201d Lilly\u2019s counsel wrote in a letter viewed by Bloomberg Law.\n\n\u201cFor good reason: the risks associated with selling unapproved, untested, unregulated, mass-produced, compounded products can lead to catastrophic harm, especially for injectable products like tirzepatide that need to be sterile.\u201d\n\nThe move ramps up Lilly\u2019s legal campaign against compounded tirzpeatide, which includes various other lawsuits against telehealth companies and medical spas, along with hundreds of cease-and-desist letters.\n\nThe cases are: Eli Lilly and Company v. Strive Pharmacy LLC, D. Del., No. 1:25-cv-00401, complaint filed 4/1/25; Eli Lilly and Company v. Empower Clinic Services LLC, D.N.J., No. 2:25-cv-02183, complaint filed 4/1/25",

At the same time, high levels of Lp(a) can double or even triple the risk of a heart attack according to research published by Harvard Medical School.\n\nRuth Gimeno, vice president of diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic research at Eli Lilly, said: \u201cReducing the inherited cardiovascular risk for patients with high Lp(a) has long been a critically unmet need. These results offer hope for a long-term, durable treatment option.\n\n\u201cThis data underscores Lilly\u2019s commitment to advancing genetic medicine to address one of the world\u2019s most pressing healthcare challenges. We will continue to evaluate the potential benefits of lepodisiran in the ongoing Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial.\u201d\n\nIn the Phase II ALPACA trial, treatment-emergent adverse events related to lepodisiran occurred in 14% of the 400mg group and 12% of the 16mg group.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nAn RNA drug developed by Eli Lilly sharply reduced blood levels of a protein particle that scientists and drugmakers increasingly see as important to assessing heart disease risk, alongside cholesterol and triglycerides.\n\nTreatment with a high dose of Lilly\u2019s drug, called lepodisiran, reduced levels of this particle, lipoprotein(a), by about 94% over a four-month period. People enrolled in the company\u2019s Phase 2 study who received one of two lower lepodisiran doses also had reduced lipoprotein(a) levels, but the declines weren\u2019t as large.\n\nAround 14% of study participants given the high lepodisiran dose experienced \u201ctreatment-emergent\u201d adverse events, but none were serious or led them to drop out of the trial, Lilly said. One patient on a lower dose died as a result of complications from chronic coronary disease.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLDL cholesterol and triglycerides are well known for their link to elevated cardiovascular risk. So too are the treatments, like statins, that can be used to tamp down high levels of either lipid.\n\nWhile genetic and epidemiological studies have shown a similar link between lipoprotein(a) and heart disease, there are no treatments available that can reduce levels of the protein particle, which seem tied to genetics.\n\nPharmaceutical companies like Lilly aim to fill the gap. Lepodisiran works by what\u2019s known as RNA interference, a biologic process drugmakers have harnessed to \u201csilence\u201d the expression of certain genes. These therapies degrade the transitional nucleic acid cells use to construct apolipoprotein(a), an essential building block for Lp(a) particles.\n\nNovartis and Amgen previously showed drugs that work this way can dramatically reduce Lp(a) levels. Both companies, as well as Lilly, are now running large Phase 3 trials designed to prove that Lp(a)-lowering translates to a cardioprotective benefit.\n\nHow well they do remains an open question. \u201cHow much lipoprotein(a) reduction is necessary to produce clinical benefits remains uncertain and has been debated,\u201d wrote the authors of a paper publishing Lilly\u2019s results in The New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday. The data were also presented at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s annual conference.\n\nNovartis will likely be first to provide an answer. The company had expected a readout of data from its late-stage study this year, but now anticipates results will be available in 2026. Amgen could also have data from its trial in 2026, but likely later in the year.\n\nIf these studies are successful, Lp(a)-lowering therapies could become a third pillar for managing heart disease risk in the 20% or so of Americans who are estimated to have elevated levels of the protein.\n\nIn addition to lepodisiran, Lilly is advancing an oral drug called muvalaplin that targets Lp(a) and is exploring gene editing approaches to treatment with Verve Therapeutics. Merck & Co., meanwhile, recently paid $200 million to China-based Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical to license a competing oral medicine.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment is approved for use in the U.S. but the European Medicines Agency recommended against the approval of the drug on Thursday.\n\nIndiana-based pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is part of the race to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease worldwide. One of its drugs was recently approved in the United States. But the European Medicines Agency recommended against the approval of the drug on Thursday.\n\nKisunla, also known as donanemab, is a monthly Alzhemier\u2019s injection produced by Eli Lilly that treats mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia stage due to early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.\n\nCompany research shows it slowed cognitive decline by up to 35%, and was approved for use in the U.S. last year.\n\nBut the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use, part of the European Medicines Agency, said the benefits of the treatment don\u2019t outweigh the potential side effects, like fatal brain swelling.\n\nThe clinical trial for Kisunla included over 1,700 people located in eight countries. Of that group, three people died, potentially from the treatment.\n\n\u201cIn reaching its conclusion, the Agency acknowledged the unmet medical need for treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and took into consideration the views of patients and healthcare professionals who shared their needs and experiences related to living with or treating the condition,\u201d the CHMP wrote in an overview of its opinion.\n\nIlya Yuffa, executive vice president and president of Lilly International wrote in a press release that the company remains \u201cconfident in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment,\u201d which has also been approved in Great Britain, Japan and China.\n\n\u201cEuropeans living with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease and their loved ones urgently need additional treatment options,\u201d Yuffa said. \u201cToday\u2019s disappointing CHMP opinion means they must keep waiting.\u201d\n\nRoughly 7 million Europeans live with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with numbers estimated to increase to 14 million by 2030, according to the European Brain Council.\n\nIn the U.S., an estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older had Alzheimer's dementia in 2023, and research from the National Library of Medicine shows the number could increase to 13.8 million by 2060.\n\nTwo years ago the U.S. approved Leqembi, an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment developed by Biogen Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. and Eisai Co in Japan. It was initially rejected by CHMP in July 2024. But after a re-examination process, the committee later reversed its statement and recommended it last November.\n\nJoanne Pike, CEO and president of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association based in Chicago, Ill., hopes the EMA\u2019s committee will also reconsider its opinion on Kisunla.\n\n\u201cAs the EMA did when they first delayed approval for another treatment, Leqembi, we expect the EMA will quickly reverse this decision,\u201d Pike said. \u201cIt is a shame that the EMA is delaying access to a treatment that benefits people in the earliest stages.\u201d\n\nLilly International hopes a re-examination process will prompt the European Medicines Agency to reconsider its opinion.\n\nThe European Commission, an agency in charge of policy and international aid distribution, will provide the ultimate decision within 67 days of CHMP\u2019s opinion.\n\nSide Effects Public Media is a health reporting collaboration based at WFYI in Indianapolis.

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) closed the most recent trading day at $825.91, moving +0.41% from the previous trading session. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.55%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 1.01%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.14%.\n\nThe drugmaker's stock has dropped by 10.66% in the past month, falling short of the Medical sector's loss of 3.93% and the S&P 500's loss of 6.22%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Eli Lilly will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on May 1, 2025. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $4.64, showcasing a 79.84% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.75 billion, up 45.41% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $23.53 per share and a revenue of $60 billion, signifying shifts of +81.14% and +33.2%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Eli Lilly. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.18% higher. Currently, Eli Lilly is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Eli Lilly has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.96 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.14.\n\nInvestors should also note that LLY has a PEG ratio of 1.33 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.33 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 63, finds itself in the top 26% echelons of all 250+ industries.",

In the Phase 2 ALPACA study, lepodisiran significantly reduced Lp(a) levels by an average of 93.9% over the 60 to 180-day period after treatment with the highest tested dose (400 mg), meeting the primary endpoint.i Participants who received the 16 mg and 96 mg lepodisiran doses experienced a 40.8% reduction and a 75.2% reduction in Lp(a) levels over the same time period, respectively.i\n\nLepodisiran also met additional secondary endpoints, showing reductions in Lp(a) levels following one or two administrations of each of the three tested doses across all timepoints assessed throughout the nearly 18-month-long study.ii Lepodisiran was administered twice at each dose (16 mg, 96 mg, or 400 mg), once at baseline and at day 180, with a separate group receiving 400 mg at baseline and placebo at day 180. The effect of additional doses of lepodisiran remains undetermined.\n\n\"Nearly a quarter of the world's population has elevated levels of Lp(a), putting them at a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Unfortunately, there are no approved cholesterol-lowering therapies specifically for this genetic risk factor, and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise do not provide meaningful reductions,\" said Steven Nissen , M.D., chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic . \"These significant and sustained Lp(a) reductions are encouraging and suggest that siRNA approaches like lepodisiran could potentially offer durable benefits with long-term dosing.\"\n\nAbout 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which increases their risk of cardiovascular disease.1,2 Elevated Lp(a) levels can double or even triple the risk of a heart attack and are associated with other cardiovascular issues such as stroke and heart valve narrowing (aortic valve stenosis).3,4,5 Lepodisiran is an investigational siRNA therapy designed to reduce levels of Lp(a) by inhibiting the production of apolipoprotein(a) (apo[a]), a key component of Lp(a).\n\n\"Reducing the inherited cardiovascular risk for patients with high Lp(a) has long been a critically unmet need. These results offer hope for a long-term, durable treatment option,\" said Ruth Gimeno , group vice president, diabetes, obesity and cardiometabolic research at Lilly. \"These data underscore Lilly's commitment to advancing genetic medicine to address one of the world's most pressing healthcare challenges. We will continue to evaluate the potential benefits of lepodisiran in the ongoing Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial.\"\n\nResults from additional secondary endpoints showed:\n\nParticipants who received 400 mg of lepodisiran at both baseline and day 180 experienced a 94.8% reduction in average Lp(a) levels over the day 30 to 360 period, which remained 91.0% below baseline at day 360 (~1 year) and 74.2% below baseline at day 540 (~1.5 years). ii\n\nLepodisiran also reduced apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels, a separate cholesterol biomarker. The highest dose (400 mg) of lepodisiran showed 14.1% and 13.7% ApoB reductions from baseline at day 60 and 180, respectively. A second 400 mg lepodisiran dose at day 180 sustained these apoB reductions through day 540.ii\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to the study drug occurred in 1% (1/69) of the placebo group, 3% (1/36) of the 16 mg group, 12% (9/74) of the 96 mg group and 14% (20/141) of the pooled 400 mg group. There were no serious adverse events related to lepodisiran treatment. A single death occurred in the 16 mg dose group due to complications of chronic coronary disease. One participant in the placebo group was withdrawn from the study drug due to a TEAE; however, no participants receiving lepodisiran experienced a TEAE leading to withdrawal from treatment or the study.\n\nThe ACCLAIM-Lp(a) Phase 3 clinical development program, investigating the effect of lepodisiran on the reduction of cardiovascular events in adults with elevated Lp(a), is currently enrolling.\n\nAbout ALPACA\n\nALPACA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of lepodisiran in adults with elevated Lp(a). A total of 320 participants were randomized to receive either placebo or one of three doses of lepodisiran (16 mg, 96 mg, or 400 mg) both at baseline and day 180. An additional group received 400 mg of lepodisiran at baseline and placebo at day 180. Results from the two groups receiving 400 mg of lepodisiran were pooled for the primary analysis. The primary endpoint was placebo-adjusted, time-averaged percent change in Lp(a) serum concentration from day 60 to 180.\n\nAbout Lilly\n\nLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

            "content": "European regulators rejected Lilly\u2019s Kisunla citing the number of ARIA-related deaths in its Phase 3 trial. The company will look to appeal the decision.\n\nOn March 27th, the European Medicines Agency rejected Eli Lilly\u2019s anti-amyloid drug Kisunla. Kisunla is currently approved in the U.S., Japan, and China. But in the EU, regulators argued that the small benefits of the drug, which are similar to Leqembi\u2019s, were not large enough to \u201coutweigh the risks of potentially fatal events\u201d caused by brain swelling and small brain bleeds (ARIA).\n\nThe company plans to appeal the decision.\n\nDuring the Phase 3 trial, three participants died because of ARIA. Lilly proposed restricting the drug to people with early Alzheimer\u2019s who do not have ApoE4, a minority of the participants in the trial. But among them, there was still one death. Even in people without ApoE4, the regulatory agency felt approving the drug was too risky.\n\n\u201cIn reaching its conclusion, the agency acknowledged the unmet medical need for treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and took into consideration the views of patients and healthcare professionals who shared their needs and experiences related to living with or treating the condition,\u201d read the decision by the EU\u2019s drug regulatory agency.\n\nDr. Nicolas Villain, a neurologist and associate professor of Neurology at Sorbonne University in France, told Being Patient that it was likely a close call for the regulators, as they weighed the deaths and serious side effects against the drug\u2019s benefit.\n\n\u201cLow numbers can be influenced by random factors, and so it\u2019s hard to make a definite decision on such a low number of events,\u201d Villain said of this risk-benefit analysis. \u201cEurope is already on the conservative side when making decisions about drug approval, so I\u2019m not that surprised\u201d that the drug was rejected.\n\nLilly has 15 days to appeal the decision. Villain speculated that Lilly might provide data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 trial, which is testing whether lower doses of the drug reduce the rate of serious side effects. But he isn\u2019t sure the trial has enough participants without any copies of the ApoE4 gene to reassure the regulators.\n\n\u201cWe hope that through the re-examination process, we will be able to continue our discussions with the agency to bring donanemab to the millions of people across Europe suffering from this relentless, fatal disease,\u201d said Ilya Yuffa, executive vice president and president of Lilly International.\n\nSometimes, these appeals yield different results: Last year, the EU regulatory agency changed its mind on Eisai and Biogen\u2019s drug Leqembi \u2014 initially saying no, but eventually approving it for people without two copies of the ApoE4 gene.\n\nMore will be revealed. But in this case the agency has already stated it finds the risk of Kisunla side effects for people with no copies of the ApoE4 gene to be dangerously high.",

            "content": "Over the last couple of years, the pharmaceutical sector has captivated investors thanks in large part to novel medications used to treat chronic weight management and diabetes.\n\nWhile you may be more familiar with brand names such as Ozempic or Wegovy, these drugs are known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists in the medical world. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has emerged as one of the hottest stocks in the GLP-1 realm -- underscored by its combination of blockbuster treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhile Lilly's success with GLP-1 drugs is certainly impressive, I have my eyes on another area of the company this year. Let's dig into what Lilly's business looks like beyond weight loss treatments, and explore which of the company's tailwinds has me most excited.\n\nEli Lilly has more to offer than just GLP-1 drugs\n\nAs it stands today, Mounjaro is Lilly's largest source of revenue while Zepbound is the company's fastest-growing business -- generating nearly $5 billion of sales during its first full calendar year on the market in 2024. Given this stat line, it's not all that surprising that Lilly's stock price tends to move based on investor sentiment around the GLP-1 operation.\n\nHowever, Lilly has several other market-leading medications that are used to treat cancer, plaque psoriasis, eczema, and other conditions. But to me, one of the biggest hidden opportunities inside Lilly's ecosystem is Kisunla. Kisunla was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last summer and represents Lilly's entrance into treating Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAn elderly person looking out the window.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy am I optimistic about Kisunla?\n\nAccording to data from Market.us, the global Alzheimer's disease market is estimated to be worth roughly $8 billion. However, industry trends suggest that the market size for Alzheimer's disease will grow almost fourfold over the next several years -- reaching a size of $31 billion by 2033. Yet despite this rapid growth, Alzheimer's disease remains a fairly fragmented market when it comes to widely available and approved treatments.\n\nToday, one of the more popular treatments for combatting Alzheimer's disease is Leqembi -- a drug developed by Biogen and Eisai. Of note, Eisai previously experienced a great deal of success with a different Alzheimer's drug, called Aricept, back in the early and mid-2000s before patent expiries.\n\nLeqembi has only been FDA-approved since July 2023 and officially launched later that year in December. Although its history as a commercially available treatment is limited, business results have been mixed so far.\n\nAccording to Eisai's financials, Leqembi has generated 29.6 billion yen ($198 million) through the nine-month period April through December 2024. To add some color to these figures, Eisai actually revised its full-year 2024 forecast for Leqembi to 42.5 billion yen -- down from the initial forecast of 56.5 billion yen. The company cited delays in the sales launch in the U.S. for the newly protracted financial target.\n\nEisai's underwhelming launch for Leqembi is a big deal, as the U.S. is the company's largest source of growth for its Alzheimer's disease business. To me, the lackluster launch in the U.S. represents an opportunity for Lilly to pounce with Kisunla.\n\nThe combination of a large total addressable market (TAM), limited competition, and a rough start for Leqembi could all work in Lilly's favor as the company begins to scale Kisunla this year.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy right now?\n\nRight now, Lilly trades at a forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple of 36. As the chart below illustrates, Lilly's current forward P/E is roughly 40% lower today than it was just a year ago.\n\nLLY PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nLLY PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nI find the normalization in Lilly's valuation a bit confusing. The only thing I can really think of that could be driving the sell-off is the rise of generic GLP-1 drugs, which are not approved by the FDA. Despite their popularity, Lilly is competing with sellers of generic GLP-1 drugs by doubling down on its own manufacturing capabilities as well as competing more directly on price against these knock-offs.\n\nI see the valuation compression trends above as a compelling opportunity to take advantage of some depressed price action right now. I'm optimistic that Lilly's growth will be supported by much more than Mounjaro and Zepbound for years to come. In 2025, I think investors should pay particularly close attention to Kisunla's launch and how Lilly's ambitions in treating Alzheimer's disease take shape.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Its financial results, though solid compared to similarly sized peers, were not always up to investors' high standards for the market-leading drugmaker.\n\nHowever, Eli Lilly is gaining momentum, and expects significant catalysts that could send its stock price soaring in 2025. Even beyond those catalysts, Lilly remains an excellent buy-and-hold option for long-term investors.\n\nA potentially game-changing weight loss medicine\n\nIt's no secret that Eli Lilly is one of the leaders in the market for weight management drugs. The company's dual GLP-1/GIP medicine, Zepbound (tirzepatide), generated almost $5 billion in sales last year after being approved in late 2023.\n\nZepbound, like its biggest competitor, Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, is administered via subcutaneous injection once a week. However, many drugmakers have been looking to develop anti-obesity medicine options that are taken orally. These could attract more patients, even with a less convenient once-daily schedule.\n\nEnter orforglipron, a potential oral therapy that Eli Lilly is developing. This investigational medicine is undergoing phase 3 studies in weight management, and the drugmaker plans to release data from them sometime this year. If orforglipron's results rival (or beat) the performance of injectable medicines, it could send Eli Lilly's stock price soaring. And that's not just because the drug would likely become the first oral medicine for weight management approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nLongtime rival Novo Nordisk recently experienced a phase 3 trial setback with CagriSema, one of its promising weight loss candidates. Though CagriSema isn't an oral option, Lilly knocking a weight loss treatment out of the park, several months after Novo Nordisk failed to do so in the same area, would look great for Lilly's position in this fast-growing market.\n\nOrforglipron is undergoing late-stage studies across several other indications, including sleep apnea and diabetes, so while its anti-obesity results will have the most impact, it's also worth monitoring the medicine's performance elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture\n\nShould you purchase shares of Eli Lilly in anticipation of its share price jumping once it releases late-stage data for orforglipron? That would be unwise. The medicine might not quite meet the market's expectations, and it's impossible right now to predict whether it will. And long-term investors ought to look beyond such catalysts, exciting though they may be.",

Known to many as Ken Fisher, the 74-year-old is ranked at position 212 in the latest Forbes Billionaires list (as of March 11, 2025). This is thanks to the $11.2 billion of wealth he has amassed through Fisher Investments, a firm that has more than $270 billion in assets under management.\n\nFisher has a lot to say about the market, and he is an active commentator on current events. As you\u2019d expect, he had something to say about Trump\u2019s tariffs. On Tuesday, March 11, 2025, President Trump doubled down on tariff talks, threatening to double the planned tariff on Canada-imported aluminum and steel to 50%. He said the levies would be effected in 24 hours and that if Canada doesn\u2019t play ball, he \u201cwould set tariffs on cars from Canada so high that they would permanently shut down the Canadian car industry,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness and Cathie Wood\u2019s Top 12 AI Stock Picks in 2025.\n\nPresident Trump has given four reasons for the tiff with Canada. On raising tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, the president argued that the move is a response to Ontario bumping up prices on the electricity exported to the United States. He has also mentioned concerns about fentanyl trafficking, high levies on dairy imports, and that the tariffs are the current administration\u2019s \u201cbroader strategy to use economic leverage to address national security concerns and promote domestic manufacturing.\u201d\n\nFisher agrees with President Trump but only as far as the tariffs are negotiating tools. In a recent video posted on YouTube, he explains that tariffs are rarely fully enforced and argues that the actual impact of tariffs is often much smaller than people fear. The levies might be set at, say, 10-15%, but the real cost impact on goods is usually around 1.5%. He also emphasizes that markets often overreact to tariff announcements, causing unnecessary fear and volatility.",

Following recent feedback from the FDA, the company intends to file a new drug application (NDA) in 2026 for accelerated approval, with data to support monthly dosing at launch. The updated data featured 11 boys with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping who advanced to the extension portion of the study and were receiving monthly doses of WVE-N531. Results revealed stabilization of dystrophin expression through treatment, with a mean of 7.8% (95%, 5.4-10.3%) between weeks 24 and 48 of dosing. Measured by western blot, the 48-week mean dystrophin expression was 6.4% (95% CI, 3.8-9.0%).\n\nAccording to a new announcement, the FDA has approved Soleno Therapeutics' diazoxide choline (DCCR) extended-release tablets, marketed as Vykat XR, for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) for patients 4 years and older who have hyperphagia. Thus, DCCR, a novel, proprietary extended-release dosage form containing diazoxide choline \u2014 the crystalline salt of diazoxide \u2014 is administered once daily and becomes the first therapy to treat hyperphagia in PWS. In November 2024, the FDA extended its review period for the new drug application (NDA) of DCCR extended-release tablets for PWS.2 The extension was triggered by recent responses to the agency's information requests, which were classified as a major amendment to the NDA. As a result, the PDUFA goal date was pushed back by 3 months to allow the FDA sufficient time to complete its review, including the newly submitted data. Notably, the agency did not highlight any concerns related to safety, efficacy, or manufacturing in its correspondence.\n\nFor more direct access to expert insight, head to NeurologyLive.com.

            "content": "Uncontrolled hypertension is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney failure.\n\nA new type of medication may help lower blood pressure in people with uncontrolled hypertension, researchers reported Saturday at the annual meeting of American College of Cardiology in Chicago.\n\nIn a pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial, patients who took the experimental medication lorundrostat along with two or three currently available hypertension drugs saw a decrease in systolic blood pressure (the upper number) that was 8 points greater than what was seen in patients who got a placebo. The study will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThis new potential therapy for hypertension is exciting,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Luke Laffin, co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders at the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute. \u201cWe do a poor job controlling blood pressure in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of adults in the U.S. have hypertension; among them, less than 1 in 4 have their blood pressure under control.\n\nHypertension is diagnosed when a person has a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. A systolic measurement between 120 and 129 mm Hg is considered to be elevated. A normal measurement is 120/80 mm Hg or below.\n\nUncontrolled hypertension \u2014 which Laffin defined as a measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or higher even with medication \u2014 is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney failure.\n\nAmong patients taking medication for hypertension, the rate of control is 60% to 70%, said Dr. Ajay Kirtane, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. That leaves 30% to 40% of patients who need another option.\n\nLorundrostat is meant for this group of patients. The drug, part of a class called aldosterone synthase inhibitors, works by blocking the adrenal glands\u2019 synthesis of a hormone called aldosterone, which controls the amount of salt retained by the body. When aldosterone is reduced, so are salt levels and therefore blood pressure.\n\nTo test the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat, Laffin and his colleagues recruited 285 adults with uncontrolled hypertension whose average age was 60. More than half (53%) of the participants were Black.\n\nBlack patients are among those most at risk, Laffin said. About 55% of Black adults have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nDr. Oscar Cingolani, director of the hypertension program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the inclusion of so many Black patients is \u201ca big, big thing,\u201d noting that \u201cAfrican Americans \u2026 tend to be more responsive to this pathway.\u201d\n\nAll of the patients in the trial were already taking a mix of blood pressure drugs. When the trial began, the researchers standardized those treatments by putting all of the patients on two or three specific medications. Three weeks later, they randomly assigned the participants to get either a placebo or one of two doses of lorundrostat for the next 12 weeks.\n\nAt three points, the participants wore a blood pressure cuff for a 24-hour period: at the beginning, four weeks after treatment started and then again at 12 weeks.\n\nParticipants taking the lower dose of lorundrostat, 50 milligrams, plus standard medications saw an average systolic blood pressure decrease of 15.4 points, while the group receiving the placebo plus standard drugs saw a decrease of 7.4 points \u2014 so the drug-related decrease in blood pressure after accounting for the placebo response was 8 points.\n\nIncreasing the dose of the drug didn\u2019t improve the results.\n\nWhile the placebo response may seem high, it\u2019s most likely due to people being in a study and having the attention of health professionals, making them more scrupulous about taking their medications, experts said.\n\nWith a decrease of 8 points, say from 170 to 162, \u201cthat is the range where you would in a longer-term study see reductions in heart attacks and strokes,\u201d said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City.\n\nAldosterone synthase inhibitors are a new class of drugs, some of which are closer to being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration than others, Bhatt said. One other, baxdrostat, is currently in Phase 3 trials.\n\nLorundrostat has shown promise in the three levels of clinical trials needed for approval. The last one, the Phase 3 trial, is completed, though the results haven\u2019t been published yet, Laffin said. The researchers are working on the trials with drugmaker Mineralys Therapeutics, which funded the trials.\n\nThe drug could potentially be available within 12 to 18 months, Laffin said.\n\nPatients in the trial who got lorundrostat were more likely than those who got the placebo to develop high potassium levels. That\u2019s something patients\u2019 doctors would need to keep an eye out for, Bhatt said, because it can lead to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nCingolani, of Johns Hopkins, said he would like to see long-term studies on the new medication and also ones that could compare lorundrostat to an older medication that works by blocking the receptor for aldosterone.",

            "content": "Xi Jinping Courts Global Executives Amid Trade Tensions Chinese President seeks foreign investment as U.S. tariffs escalate\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping made a significant pitch to global business leaders on March 28, 2025, in Beijing, as he sought to position China as a reliable partner amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. The meeting, held at the Great Hall of the People, included over 40 executives from various industries, including prominent figures from the pharmaceutical sector and automotive giants.\n\nIn his address, Xi made a veiled critique of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent trade actions, which have involved imposing heavy tariffs on imports from China. As Trump prepares to implement a new round of tariffs on April 2, Xi emphasized the importance of stability in China-U.S. relations, stating, \"maintaining the stability, health and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations is in the fundamental interests of the people of both countries,\" as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe meeting featured key executives such as Stephen A. Schwarzman from Blackstone, Judy Marks of Otis Worldwide, and Jay Y. Lee of Samsung Electronics. Notably, the pharmaceuticals sector had a strong presence, with CEOs from AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, GSK, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, and Sanofi attending the gathering, marking the largest representation from a single industry at the event.\n\nAmong the notable speakers was Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson, who highlighted the company\u2019s recent investment of approximately 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) to establish a new production base in Beijing. This investment reflects a growing trend among foreign companies to expand their operations in China despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n\nXi's meeting with these corporate leaders comes at a critical time, as foreign investment in China has seen a decline. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, foreign investment dropped to $116 billion in 2024, down from $163 billion in 2023 and a peak of $189 billion in 2022. This decrease is attributed to various factors, including tightening national security laws and increasing wariness among global companies about making large investments in China.\n\nDuring the meeting, Xi urged the executives to maintain the stability of global supply chains, asserting that China holds significant potential for investors. He remarked, \"I often say that blowing out other people's lights does not make you brighter,\" emphasizing the need for cooperative growth rather than competitive destruction.\n\nAs the trade war intensifies, companies within the pharmaceutical sector have found themselves in a precarious position. Trump\u2019s administration has targeted pharmaceuticals for potential tariffs, prompting companies like Eli Lilly to announce substantial investments in domestic manufacturing. Earlier in February, Lilly declared a $27 billion investment to expand its production capabilities in the U.S., while also signaling intentions to increase investment in China.\n\nMeanwhile, AstraZeneca recently unveiled a $2.5 billion investment in China, which includes plans for a global strategic R&D center in Beijing. This investment comes alongside a commitment of $3.5 billion to enhance its manufacturing and R&D capabilities in the U.S., showcasing a balancing act that many pharmaceutical companies are attempting to navigate between the two largest markets.\n\nThe meeting also highlighted the automotive sector's ongoing interest in China, with executives from companies like BMW and Toyota present. BMW recently increased its stake in a Chinese joint venture, indicating a strong commitment to the Chinese market. The company has also announced plans to collaborate with Alibaba on artificial intelligence technology for its vehicles.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the trade war, the German automotive industry has been particularly active, representing a significant portion of new investments from the European Union. Reports suggest that German automakers have accounted for as much as half of the new investments, with companies like Volkswagen establishing new manufacturing facilities in China.\n\nHowever, the broader sentiment among foreign businesses remains cautious. Surveys conducted by foreign chambers of commerce indicate that deteriorating market conditions and overcapacity in several industries are contributing to a lack of confidence in potential profitability from new investments in China.\n\nAs Xi continues to court foreign investment, the ongoing trade tensions and the U.S. administration's aggressive tariff policies loom large over discussions. The recent meetings between pharmaceutical executives and Trump, where the President suggested that companies should relocate manufacturing back to the U.S., underscore the pressures these industries face.\n\nWith both sides navigating a complex web of economic and political challenges, the future of U.S.-China trade relations remains uncertain. As Xi Jinping pitches China as a protector of trade and a stable investment destination, the response from global business leaders will be crucial in determining the trajectory of foreign investment in the coming years.\n\nThe meeting on March 28 serves as a reminder of the delicate balance that multinational companies must strike as they operate in an increasingly polarized global environment. With the stakes high and the landscape constantly shifting, the paths forward for these corporations will require careful consideration and strategic planning.",

Some people may also have spots of bleeding on the surface of or in the brain and infrequently, larger areas of bleeding in the brain can occur. Although most people do not have symptoms, some people have headaches, dizziness, nausea, difficulty walking, confusion, vision changes and seizures.\n\nSome people have a genetic risk factor (homozygous apolipoprotein E \u03b54 gene carriers) that may cause an increased risk for ARIA. Talk to your healthcare provider about testing to see if you have this risk factor.\n\nYou may be at higher risk of developing bleeding in the brain if you take medicines to reduce blood clots from forming (antithrombotic medicines) while receiving Kisunla. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if you are on any medicines that increase this risk.\n\nYour healthcare provider will do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans before and during your treatment with Kisunla to check you for ARIA. You should carry information that you are receiving Kisunla, which can cause ARIA, and that ARIA symptoms can look like stroke symptoms.\n\nCall your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the symptoms listed above.\n\nThere are registries that collect information on treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Your healthcare provider can help you become enrolled in these registries.\n\nWarnings - Kisunla can cause serious allergic and infusion-related reactions. Do not receive Kisunla if you have serious allergic reactions to donanemab-azbt or any of the ingredients in Kisunla. Symptoms may include swelling of the face, lips, mouth, or eyelids, problems breathing, hives, chills, irritation of skin, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, or chest pain. You will be monitored for at least 30 minutes after you receive Kisunla for any reaction. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have these symptoms or any reaction during or after a Kisunla infusion.\n\nOther common side effects\n\nHeadache\n\nTell your healthcare provider right away if you have any side effects. These are not all of the possible side effects of Kisunla. You can report side effects at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nBefore you receive Kisunla, tell your healthcare provider:\n\nAbout all medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as well as vitamins and herbal supplements. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you have medicines to reduce blood clots from forming (antithrombotic medicines, including aspirin).\n\n\n\nAbout all of your medical conditions including if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed. Kisunla has not been studied in people who were pregnant or breastfeeding. It is not known if Kisunla could harm your unborn or breastfeeding baby.\n\nHow to receive Kisunla\n\nKisunla is a prescription medicine given through an intravenous (IV) infusion using a needle inserted into a vein in your arm. Kisunla is given once every 4 weeks. Each infusion will last about 30 minutes.\n\nLearn more\n\nFor more information about Kisunla, call 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or go to kisunla.lilly.com.\n\nThis summary provides basic information about Kisunla. It does not include all information known about this medicine. Read the information given to you about Kisunla. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about Kisunla.

The EMA still has to make a final decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe committee considered that the benefits of this medicine were not large enough to outweigh the risk of potentially fatal events due to amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), involving swelling and potential bleedings in the brain,\u201d the committee wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKisunla\u2019s active ingredient, donanemab, is an antibody designed to target amyloid beta, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and contributes to cognitive decline. By targeting amyloid beta, the drug is expected to reduce these plaques and slow the progression of the disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Kisunla last summer as a once-monthly treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 with a warning of ARIA side effects. In a late-stage clinical trial of the drug, patients with mild symptoms experienced a 35% slower decline in memory, thinking, and daily activities compared to those on a placebo.\n\nBut safety concerns overshadowed the drug\u2019s benefits in the CHMP\u2019s decision. In a clinical trial, ARIA were significantly more common among Kisunla patients. ARIA occurred in 36.8% of those who received Kisunla, compared to 14.9% of those given a placebo. While most cases were asymptomatic, 1.6% of Kisunla patients experienced serious ARIA events, including three fatal cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEli Lilly plans to seek a re-examination of the decision.\n\n\u201cEuropeans living with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease and their loved ones urgently need additional treatment options. Today\u2019s disappointing CHMP opinion means they must keep waiting,\u201d said Ilya Yuffa, executive vice president and president of Lilly International, in a statement. \u201cDonanemab has been reviewed and approved in the United States, Japan, China, and other markets. Lilly remains confident in the safety and effectiveness of donanemab and the value it can bring to patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe committee previously rejected Biogen and Eisai\u2019s rival drug, Leqembi, before ultimately recommending it for approval last year.\n\n\u201cWe view the CHMP\u2019s negative opinion on Kisunla as unsurprising, given the initial negative opinion for Leqembi, but nonetheless view it as an incremental win for Biogen and Eisai,\u201d William Blair analyst Myles R.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned -9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Lilly belongs, has lost 6.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLilly is expected to post earnings of $4.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +79.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.53 points to a change of +81.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.33 indicates a change of +33.2% from what Lilly is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lilly is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "Eli Lilly plans to appeal a verdict from key drug regulators who say the company\u2019s new treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease should not be cleared for the European market.\n\nOn Friday, the European Medicines Agency recommended that Lilly\u2019s Kisunla not receive marketing authorization because its benefits don\u2019t outweigh its potential risks. Clinical trials have shown patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s who received Kisunla instead of a placebo experienced a roughly 20% to 30% slowing of their disease, an effect deemed modest by some doctors.\n\nKisunla, along with two approved Alzheimer\u2019s therapies from partners Biogen and Eisai, is part of a class of drugs that can also cause side effects like swelling and small-scale bleeding in the brain. These effects, collectively known as \u201cARIA,\u201d have been a major sticking point for regulators. Last summer, the EMA voted against one of those Biogen and Eisai products, Leqembi, due to the \u201cfrequent occurrence\u201d of ARIA in the trials supporting its approval.\n\nThe EMA used the same language in siding against Kisunla and noted how, in clinical testing, ARIA occurred in 36.8% of people given the drug compared to 14.9% of people on a placebo. The agency said it did consider whether Kisunla might be worth recommending for patients who lack a certain gene scientists believe increases the risk of ARIA. Ultimately, though, it concluded the evidence generated so far doesn\u2019t warrant approval.\n\nThis opinion would typically go to the European Commission, which makes the final ruling on whether new drugs can be sold in member countries. But Lilly is seeking a re-examination, a process that takes about four months and assigns different reviewers to assess the marketing application.\n\nThe odds of such appeals working aren\u2019t great. Analysts at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets found that, over the past decade or so, the EMA\u2019s main drug review committee has changed its mind only 20% of the time.\n\nLilly may have a better chance, however, since Eisai\u2019s appeal for Leqembi was successful. In that case, the committee ended up endorsing approval for a select group of patients \u2014 those with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s, who have one or no copies of that risk gene.\n\nIn a statement, the president of Lilly International, Ilya Yuffa, said the company \u201cremains confident\u201d in Kisunla\u2019s safety, effectiveness and the value it could have for patients. \u201cWe hope that through the re-examination process, we will be able to continue our discussions with the agency to bring [the drug] to the millions of people across Europe suffering from this relentless, fatal disease.\u201d\n\nSome estimates hold that roughly 7 million people in Europe are living with Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s a population that analysts see as commercially important for drugs like Kisunla and Leqembi. The investment bank William Blair, for example, currently expects Leqembi sales in Europe to peak at $1.3 billion in 2031.\n\nAccording to Myles Minter, an analyst at William Blair who covers Biogen, the EMA\u2019s Kisunla decision is both \u201cunsurprising, given the initial negative opinion for Leqembi,\u201d and an \u201cincremental win\u201d for Biogen and Eisai.\n\nYet, Minter wrote in a note to clients that late-stage trials showed higher rates of ARIA with Kisunla than with Leqembi. As such, his team thinks the probability of the EMA reversing its opinion is \u201cmaterially lower\u201d compared to the Leqembi case.\n\nKisunla is already approved in the U.S., U.K., China and Japan.

            "content": "New tools to connect with independent in-person and telehealth providers specializing in Alzheimer's disease are designed to increase capacity and reduce delays in diagnosis\n\nINDIANAPOLIS , March 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) has expanded its LillyDirect digital healthcare platform to offer connections to independent in-person and telehealth options for people in the U.S. living with Alzheimer's disease, the majority of whom have not been formally diagnosed.1\n\nBoth clinicians and people living with Alzheimer's disease have expressed the need to increase the capacity of our health care systems to diagnose and manage more of the nearly 7 million Americans living with the disease.2 Many patients face prolonged wait times to see a dementia specialist. These wait times are predicted to rise to more than 1 year in 2025 and can be even longer for people who live in rural and medically underserved areas.3 Nearly 1 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries drive more than 50 miles each way to see a neurologist.4 As a consequence, it can take 2 years or more after the onset of symptoms for a patient to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.5\n\nTimely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with the aid of biomarker tests is critical to help patients and families manage the complications of this disease. More treatment options are potentially available for people diagnosed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Once individuals progress to moderate or severe dementia, treatment options are more limited, and patients experience greater dependence on others. It is estimated that as many as 3,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease progress from the mild stage of disease to the moderate or severe stages every day.6\n\n\"We know that early diagnosis and care can make a big difference for people living with Alzheimer's disease. By expanding this platform, we hope to help patients identify and access additional independent specialty care capacity, which can coordinate with a patient's existing care team,\" said David Hyman , MD, Lilly's chief medical officer. \"The addition of Alzheimer's disease to LillyDirect reaffirms our commitment to empower patients to locate the care that is right for them when they need it.\"\n\nIn contrast to other conditions on LillyDirect, the Alzheimer's disease resources will not include mail order pharmacy options to Lilly medicines. Instead, they will focus on education and pathways to connect people to independent provider options.\n\nLillyDirect now offers these new connections to independent in-person and telehealth options designed to help people experiencing memory and thinking issues to overcome barriers to diagnosis and care:\n\nHealthgrades, an independent doctor locator tool, helps people quickly identify local office-based clinicians who have experience managing patients with Alzheimer's disease and using appropriate biomarker tests to help make timely and accurate diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn option to connect to Synapticure, an independent provider specializing in neurodegenerative care, including Alzheimer's disease. Lilly will continue to evaluate additional providers for inclusion as patient options for this condition in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nLilly continues to offer disease state education for people with memory concerns via MoreThanNormalAging.com, including an overview of Alzheimer's disease, from recognizing signs to the importance of early diagnosis and starting the conversation with a provider.\n\nHealthgrades\n\nThe independent doctor locator tool on LillyDirect will allow patients to identify office-based clinicians in a patient's local area who have experience diagnosing and managing patients with Alzheimer's disease. The search tool offers multiple filtering and sorting options, allowing users to find specialized health care providers within the database who meet their specific needs.\n\nSynapticure\n\nThe inclusion of telehealth providers as independent care options on LillyDirect is the result of an extensive multi-disciplinary evaluation process, which uses a rigorous set of criteria to offer connections to high-quality, comprehensive care by an experienced care team.\n\nSynapticure employs a team of clinicians to offer management during any or all of the phases of Alzheimer's disease care, including diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Its telehealth capabilities include live video visits, broad insurance coverage, prior authorization support, 24-hour access when needed, ongoing medication and care management, and behavioral health and lifestyle support. Synapticure refers patients to diagnostic tests performed in health care facilities, and in cases of emergencies, its staff stay on the phone with patients until they reach a hospital emergency room to ensure coordination of care.\n\nSynapticure commits to a connection with a care navigator within approximately two days of a patient inquiry and an appointment with a neurologist experienced in Alzheimer's care in about two weeks.\n\n\"As a caregiver of someone with a neurodegenerative condition, I helped start Synapticure to ensure that patients receive timely and accurate diagnoses, as well as ongoing support and treatment,\" said Sandra Abrevaya , CEO of Synapticure. \"We are excited to be added to LillyDirect as a patient option for comprehensive telehealth services for Alzheimer's patients, especially those in rural and underserved communities. By leveraging our experienced team of clinicians and advanced telehealth capabilities, we aim to provide hope and help for patients and their families.\"\n\nFor more information on the LillyDirect Alzheimer's resources and to access these new tools, visit lillydirect.lilly.com.

            "content": "Mounjaro and Zepbound are Eli Lilly's largest sources of growth, but there is much more to the company.\n\nOver the last couple of years, the pharmaceutical sector has captivated investors thanks in large part to novel medications used to treat chronic weight management and diabetes.\n\nWhile you may be more familiar with brand names such as Ozempic or Wegovy, these drugs are known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists in the medical world. Eli Lilly (LLY -2.49%) has emerged as one of the hottest stocks in the GLP-1 realm -- underscored by its combination of blockbuster treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nWhile Lilly's success with GLP-1 drugs is certainly impressive, I have my eyes on another area of the company this year. Let's dig into what Lilly's business looks like beyond weight loss treatments, and explore which of the company's tailwinds has me most excited.\n\nEli Lilly has more to offer than just GLP-1 drugs\n\nAs it stands today, Mounjaro is Lilly's largest source of revenue while Zepbound is the company's fastest-growing business -- generating nearly $5 billion of sales during its first full calendar year on the market in 2024. Given this stat line, it's not all that surprising that Lilly's stock price tends to move based on investor sentiment around the GLP-1 operation.\n\nHowever, Lilly has several other market-leading medications that are used to treat cancer, plaque psoriasis, eczema, and other conditions. But to me, one of the biggest hidden opportunities inside Lilly's ecosystem is Kisunla. Kisunla was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last summer and represents Lilly's entrance into treating Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhy am I optimistic about Kisunla?\n\nAccording to data from Market.us, the global Alzheimer's disease market is estimated to be worth roughly $8 billion. However, industry trends suggest that the market size for Alzheimer's disease will grow almost fourfold over the next several years -- reaching a size of $31 billion by 2033. Yet despite this rapid growth, Alzheimer's disease remains a fairly fragmented market when it comes to widely available and approved treatments.\n\nToday, one of the more popular treatments for combatting Alzheimer's disease is Leqembi -- a drug developed by Biogen and Eisai. Of note, Eisai previously experienced a great deal of success with a different Alzheimer's drug, called Aricept, back in the early and mid-2000s before patent expiries.\n\nLeqembi has only been FDA-approved since July 2023 and officially launched later that year in December. Although its history as a commercially available treatment is limited, business results have been mixed so far.\n\nAccording to Eisai's financials, Leqembi has generated 29.6 billion yen ($198 million) through the nine-month period April through December 2024. To add some color to these figures, Eisai actually revised its full-year 2024 forecast for Leqembi to 42.5 billion yen -- down from the initial forecast of 56.5 billion yen. The company cited delays in the sales launch in the U.S. for the newly protracted financial target.\n\nEisai's underwhelming launch for Leqembi is a big deal, as the U.S. is the company's largest source of growth for its Alzheimer's disease business. To me, the lackluster launch in the U.S. represents an opportunity for Lilly to pounce with Kisunla.\n\nThe combination of a large total addressable market (TAM), limited competition, and a rough start for Leqembi could all work in Lilly's favor as the company begins to scale Kisunla this year.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy right now?\n\nRight now, Lilly trades at a forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple of 36. As the chart below illustrates, Lilly's current forward P/E is roughly 40% lower today than it was just a year ago.\n\nI find the normalization in Lilly's valuation a bit confusing. The only thing I can really think of that could be driving the sell-off is the rise of generic GLP-1 drugs, which are not approved by the FDA. Despite their popularity, Lilly is competing with sellers of generic GLP-1 drugs by doubling down on its own manufacturing capabilities as well as competing more directly on price against these knock-offs.\n\nI see the valuation compression trends above as a compelling opportunity to take advantage of some depressed price action right now. I'm optimistic that Lilly's growth will be supported by much more than Mounjaro and Zepbound for years to come. In 2025, I think investors should pay particularly close attention to Kisunla's launch and how Lilly's ambitions in treating Alzheimer's disease take shape.",

            "content": "Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. Don't believe it? Then look at the Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) share price. It's 506% higher than it was five years ago. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. In the last week shares have slid back 1.2%. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Eli Lilly achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 43% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 70.07.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:LLY Earnings Per Share Growth March 27th 2025\n\nWe know that Eli Lilly has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Eli Lilly, it has a TSR of 544% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nEli Lilly provided a TSR of 6.9% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 45% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Eli Lilly (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .",

Instead, they will focus on education and pathways to connect people to independent provider options.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "announced an expansion of its LillyDirect digital healthcare platform to facilitate contact with healthcare providers for Alzheimer's patients\u2014providing a targeted solution for timely diagnosis amid highlighted capacity issues. This aligns with a broader push in addressing Alzheimer's care and may be a factor behind Eli Lilly's 4% price rise over the last quarter. Other significant developments include promising phase 3 trial results for alopecia areata and the FDA's approval of Omvoh, which, along with solid earnings, position the company favorably even as market sentiment remained cautious amidst tariff-related news affecting broader indices.\n\nNYSE:LLY Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nEli Lilly's shares achieved a very large total return over the last five years, significantly outperforming the broader market during this period. This remarkable performance can be attributed to several key developments. The company's investment of over US$23 billion since 2020 to expand manufacturing capacity in multiple locations directly supports increasing demand for its products. Additionally, the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics and collaboration with OpenAI highlight Eli Lilly's commitment to enhancing its product pipeline, potentially boosting revenue.\n\nFurthermore, the approval of Omvoh for Crohn's disease in March 2025 exemplifies Eli Lilly's successful product diversification strategy. The ongoing international expansion plans, particularly for Mounjaro, indicate a strong focus on capturing market opportunities abroad, demonstrating growth potential. However, over the past year, Eli Lilly's shares underperformed the U.S. market, which returned 8.5%, with the company's stock facing pricing pressure and competitive challenges alongside the positive growth narrative.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

To assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) the Top Stock to Buy According to Two Sigma Investments?\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 115\n\nTwo Sigma Investments\u2019 Equity Stake: $619.45 Million\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), established in 1876, is a multinational pharmaceutical firm headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, with operations spanning 18 countries. Its products are available in approximately 125 countries, highlighting its extensive global presence. Beyond its pharmaceutical innovations, the company prioritizes inclusive clinical trials and is dedicated to making its medications both accessible and affordable to diverse populations.\n\nTwo Sigma Investments recently boosted its holdings in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) by 50%, increasing its stake from 536,000 shares in Q3 2024 to 802,400 shares in Q4 2024. This investment, valued at over $619 million, positions the company as the hedge fund\u2019s seventh most valuable holding in its 13F filings for the quarter ending December 2024.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced its fourth-quarter 2024 financial results, showcasing impressive revenue growth and a promising outlook. CEO David A. Ricks highlighted the company\u2019s progress in addressing chronic diseases linked to obesity, expanding manufacturing operations, and introducing key new therapies. Quarterly revenue soared by 45% year-over-year to $13.53 billion, driven largely by the strong performance of its products Mounjaro and Zepbound. Earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled, surging 114% to $5.32. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly forecasts 2025 revenue in the range of $58.0 billion to $61.0 billion, with an EPS estimate between $22.05 and $23.55, reinforcing confidence in its future financial trajectory.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 115 hedge funds held positions in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) at the close of Q4 2024, with a combined value nearing $16.65 billion\u2014an increase from 106 funds in the prior quarter. This growing hedge fund interest reflects strong confidence in the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects and its robust pharmaceutical pipeline.\n\nWith a history of innovation, strong revenue performance, and increasing investor confidence, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) remains a top stock to buy according to Two Sigma Investments. Its dominance in high-demand therapeutic areas and ongoing product launches position the company for sustained success in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY): LLY was a top detractor in the fourth quarter following a rare revenue miss in the company\u2019s 3Q update. The greater than $1 billion miss in the tirzepatide complex (Mounjaro/Zepbound) was caused by a combination of factors, including wholesaler stocking patterns (2Q inventory build, 3Q sell through), refrigerated supply chain constraints, timing of the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer efforts, and the pace of international market launches. We believe the diabetes/obesity/weight-loss market is enormous and that current GLP-1 drugs, though no longer supply constrained, are greatly in demand. We are confident that LLY\u2019s recent sales shortfall was supply chain-related and that the company\u2019s tirzepatide franchise growth will soon reaccelerate.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 7th on our list of top stocks to buy according to Two Sigma Investments. While we acknowledge the potential for LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "After finally resolving the manufacturing issues that dogged the rollout of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss in the U.S., Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are shifting their focus to world domination.\n\nLilly laid down the latest gauntlet, winning approval for tirzepatide in India\u2014a market that Leerink Partners analysts called substantial in a note to clients this week. About 18% of Indian adults are overweight, according to the World Obesity Federation. The drug will be sold not as Zepbound, the brand name when marketed for weight loss in the U.S., but by its diabetes moniker Mounjaro.\n\nElsewhere in the world, Novo has led on approvals and launches. While both companies\u2019 drugs are approved for weight loss in many regions of the world, far fewer areas have actually seen the therapies become available.\n\nEurope is a prime example. The European Medicines Agency authorized Wegovy in January 2022 and Mounjaro for weight management in June 2024. So far, Wegovy has launched in France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Iceland and Novo\u2019s home country of Denmark. The drug is also available in the U.K. Zepbound, meanwhile, can only be found in Poland.\n\nBoth companies have been duking it out in China for at least a few months. Wegovy started flowing in the region in November 2024, while Lilly conducted a limited launch there in 2024 and has plans to ramp up in the country.\n\nWegovy has by far the biggest global footprint, with launches underway in Brazil, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and Canada.\n\nIndia is an interesting market, with drugs typically selling for well below half of U.S. net pricing, Leerink said. Lilly has priced the weight loss drug at $200 for a month supply. This compares to $483 for the drug in China and a U.S. list price of about $1,087.37 per fill (several direct-to-consumer cost savings programs that can bring the price down to about $650 per month for U.S. self-pay customers).\n\nCombining the opportunities in China and India, Leerink estimates there are 718 million addressable patients.\n\nNovo has targeted an India launch in 2026, giving Lilly a full year of momentum. Lilly, meanwhile, has plans to launch tirzepatide in Brazil and Mexico, with more revenue coming from those regions, plus China and India,beginning in the second half of this year and into 2026, Leerink noted.\n\nDuring a fourth-quarter earnings call, Lilly CEO David Ricks noted that the company is \u201cstill gating promotion and gating launches globally\u201d due to supply constraints.",

That question has also piqued the interest of three health policy researchers at Brown University. When Ateev Mehrotra and Olivier Wouters \u2014 who have expertise in telehealth and pharmaceutical policy, respectively \u2014 started discussing these novel arrangements, they had a head-scratching moment. \u201cBoth of us got stuck because we\u2019re like, \u2018This seems kind of fishy,\u2019\u201d Mehrotra told STAT. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know, what do you think?\u2019\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey brought in colleague Erin Fuse Brown for legal perspective, and on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the trio highlighted how partnerships between telehealth and pharma could enable access to necessary care \u2014 as well as their potential to induce medically unnecessary and expensive prescriptions.

            "content": "TLDR\n\nBernstein analysts maintain \u201cOutperform\u201d rating for Eli Lilly with $1,100 price target\n\nCompetitor Novo Nordisk enters triple-G drug space, validating Eli Lilly\u2019s approach with Retatrutide\n\nEli Lilly reported 32% revenue growth in 2024 with similar growth projected for 2025\n\nCompany expanding globally with Mounjaro launch in India\n\nRetatrutide showing promising results beyond weight loss, including potential cancer applications\n\nEli Lilly continues to strengthen its position in the highly competitive weight management and diabetes treatment markets, with analysts showing confidence in the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s strategy and pipeline. Recent developments highlight the company\u2019s growth trajectory and the intensifying competition in the weight loss drug sector.\n\nBernstein analysts recently reiterated their \u201cOutperform\u201d rating for Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) with a price target of $1,100. This vote of confidence comes as the stock currently trades around $849.63, suggesting significant upside potential according to the analysts.\n\nThe endorsement arrives at a time when pharmaceutical rival Novo Nordisk is making moves in the triple-G mechanism space. Novo Nordisk has entered an exclusive licensing agreement with United Laboratories, a Chinese biotech firm, to develop UBT251, a GLP1/GIP/Glucagon triple agonist similar to Eli Lilly\u2019s Retatrutide.\n\nThis deal involves a $200 million upfront payment, with potential milestone payments reaching $1.8 billion plus tiered royalties. United Laboratories will retain rights to China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan markets.\n\nBernstein analysts view Novo Nordisk\u2019s entry into this space as validation of Eli Lilly\u2019s approach with Retatrutide. Despite the possibility that UBT251 may offer improved weight loss benefits, the analysts favor Eli Lilly\u2019s lead position with Retatrutide.\n\nGrowth and Performance\n\nEli Lilly has demonstrated impressive financial performance recently. The company reported revenue growth of 32% in 2024, reaching approximately $45 billion. This growth rate exceeds the average for similarly sized pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance for 2025 projects similar growth, with forecasts indicating a 32% increase in revenue at the mid-point. This continued expansion is fueled by several key medications in Eli Lilly\u2019s portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s strong performance is driven by multiple successful drugs. These include diabetes treatment Mounjaro, anti-obesity medicine Zepbound, Alzheimer\u2019s treatment Kisunla (approved last year), and eczema medication Ebglyss.\n\nThe company also maintains a robust pipeline of drug candidates. This includes several promising anti-obesity and diabetes programs, oncology candidates, and even a gene therapy for genetic deafness that has shown encouraging early results.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s innovative capabilities have been its greatest asset over the years. This focus on innovation helps offset the inevitable patent expirations that affect all pharmaceutical companies.\n\nStrategic Moves and Market Position\n\nEli Lilly recently expanded its global footprint by introducing Mounjaro in India. This strategic move positions the company to address rising obesity and diabetes rates in the country, putting Eli Lilly ahead of competitor Novo Nordisk in this important market.\n\nBeyond weight management, Retatrutide is showing promise in other therapeutic areas. Bernstein SocGen Group highlighted pre-clinical data suggesting Retatrutide may reduce tumor progression in cancer models, potentially offering superior benefits compared to existing incretin-based treatments.\n\nThe company has also established itself as a top player in the rapidly growing market for weight management medicines. Its current lineup is helping drive impressive revenue growth that stands out even among large pharmaceutical companies.\n\nDespite having a relatively modest dividend yield of 0.7% (compared to the S&P 500\u2019s average of 1.3%), Eli Lilly has increased its dividend payouts by 200% over the past decade. This makes it an attractive option for dividend growth investors.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $763 billion and a 55-year track record of consecutive dividend payments, Eli Lilly demonstrates strong market presence and financial stability.\n\nOther analysts also maintain positive outlooks on Eli Lilly. Jefferies has a \u201cBuy\u201d rating with a $1,020 price target, emphasizing the upcoming ACHIEVE-1 Phase 3 trial results for diabetes treatment Orfo, expected in the second quarter.\n\nUBS analysts have mixed perspectives, with one maintaining a \u201cNeutral\u201d rating and another a \u201cBuy\u201d rating, both with a $1,100 price target. UBS noted an uptick in Zepbound prescriptions, though recent quarterly performances for both Zepbound and Mounjaro fell short of expectations.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s stock has shown strong momentum over the past year, delivering a 12.6% return. Analyst targets for the stock currently range from $620 to $1,190, reflecting varied but generally positive outlooks on the company\u2019s future performance.",

Scott Olson | Getty Images\n\nPatients, doctors and investors will soon learn a lot more about a new, more convenient treatment that could shake up the booming weight loss drug market. Eli Lilly plans to release initial results from several late-stage clinical trials on its experimental once-daily obesity pill, orforglipron, this year. The company has said it expects to unveil data from five studies in patients with Type 2 diabetes and two trials in people with obesity in 2025. Analysts expect the pill to be as effective, safe and tolerable to take as Novo Nordisk 's semaglutide \u2013 the active ingredient in its popular but costly weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic. The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most critical and closely watched of the year, as they bring Eli Lilly's drug one step closer to becoming a new, needle-free alternative for weight loss and diabetes. \"This could join a growing toolbox of medications for obesity, and it could be a game-changer,\" said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, medical director for UC San Diego's Center for Advanced Weight Management. If it enters the market, orforglipron could help more patients access the treatments and alleviate the supply shortfalls of the injections on the market. The pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as a slate of other drugmakers race to bring a product to the market. Offering the first oral version of a so-called GLP-1 could help Eli Lilly capture an even greater share of the market for that popular class of weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly is currently about three years ahead of other drugmakers developing pills, including Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Roche , Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics , Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez told CNBC. Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s. Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, Fernandez said. In a statement, Eli Lilly said it is \"investigating orforglipron for the potential to bring a safe and effective treatment to people with these diseases who are looking for a convenient, oral option.\" Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic, and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. But unlike those three medications, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus does. It is unclear whether orforglipron will have a hefty list price similar to those of the injections, which cost roughly $1,000 per month, or whether it will help expand insurance coverage for obesity treatments. Medicare and many employer-based plans still don't cover those drugs. But so-called small molecule pills will at least be easier for Eli Lilly to manufacture than injections. In January, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the pill could receive U.S. regulatory approval as soon as early 2026. The company also said in its annual report in February it recorded a nearly $550 million \"pre-launch inventory\" charge for oforglipron, meaning it is preparing to manufacture the drug even before its approval. \"That's a good indicator that they are comfortable with what they're seeing across the trials,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman told CNBC. Eli Lilly has benefitted from the windfall from tirzepatide \u2013 the active ingredient in its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes shot Mounjaro \u2013 which targets GLP-1 but also activates another gut hormone called GIP. Fueled by those treatments, Eli Lilly has become the largest global pharmaceutical and health-care company by market cap, with a market value of about $814 billion as of Monday. The company raked in more than $45 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, a significant share of which came from its portfolio of diabetes and obesity products.\n\nWho could benefit from the pill\n\nWhile injections will likely remain a popular option, a once-daily pill like Eli Lilly's could be much easier for some patients to take and store. \"What we're going to see over the next couple of years is that we're moving away from one-size-fits-all products to more customized products that are more directly aligned to the profile of the patient,\" Seigerman said. Patients can inject Zepbound and Wegovy under their skin with a click of a button, but must follow specific instructions, such as storing the shots at certain temperatures and injecting in a different spot each week. Meanwhile, Rybelsus must be taken in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water.\n\nRebekah Carl injects herself with her weekly dose of Wegovy in New Columbia, Pennsylvania, U.S., November 13, 2023. Hannah Beier | Reuters\n\nOrforglipron does not have dietary restrictions, and will also offer an option for patients who could benefit from treatment but are afraid of needles. Th pill could also tap into new markets in countries that don't have the resources for the cold supply chains needed to store and administer GLP-1 injections, Guggenheim's Fernandez said. People who lost weight on the injections and are tired of taking a shot every week could also be \"good candidates\" to switch to a pill and take them as maintenance doses, which are meant to be taken long term to prolong the effects of a drug, Seigerman added. Eli Lilly is studying orforglipron as a maintenance dose in patients who took tirzepatide throughout a phase three trial called SURMOUNT-5, with results expected in early 2026. Still, some patients who don't mind taking injections may continue their current treatment regimen, UCSD's Grunvald noted. He said some people already take several pills for other conditions each day, so they may prefer to take an injection once a week \"and forget about it rather than adding another pill.\" Eli Lilly's pill could also be more fit for people who are overweight or \"modestly obese,\" said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. Those who have a very high body mass index will \"best be treated with injectables that offer greater efficacy,\" Risinger said. While orforglipron is expected to be as good for weight loss as Wegovy, Zepbound, on average, is more effective at helping patients lose weight than Novo Nordisk's injection, according to real-world data and a head-to-head trial on the drugs.\n\nLate-stage diabetes trials on orforglipron ACHIEVE-1 \u2013 Study of orforglipron in adults with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate control of blood sugar levels with diet and exercise\n\nStudy of orforglipron in adults with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate control of blood sugar levels with diet and exercise ACHIEVE-5 \u2013 Study of orforglipron in patients with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate control of blood sugar levels with insulin glargine, with or without the diabetes treatments Metformin and/or SGLT-2 Inhibitors\n\nStudy of orforglipron in patients with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate control of blood sugar levels with insulin glargine, with or without the diabetes treatments Metformin and/or SGLT-2 Inhibitors ACHIEVE-J \u2013 Long-term safety study of orforglipron in patients with Type 2 diabetes\n\nLong-term safety study of orforglipron in patients with Type 2 diabetes ACHIEVE-3 \u2013 Study of orforglipron compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with Metformin\n\nStudy of orforglipron compared with semaglutide in participants with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with Metformin ACHIEVE-4 \u2013 Study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased cardiovascular risk\n\nStudy of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased cardiovascular risk ACHIEVE-2 \u2013 Study of orforglipron compared with dapagliflozin (prescription drug for diabetes and heart failure) in patients with Type 2 diabetes and inadequate control of blood sugar levels with Metformin\n\nA pill is a welcome alternative for patients like Willow Baillies, 29, who has been injecting herself with cheaper, compounded versions of Zepbound because her insurance does not cover the branded medication. The Food and Drug Administration, in most cases, now bars compounding pharmacies from making those unapproved versions because it declared the Zepbound shortage over in December. Baillies, a human resources specialist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said a pill would \"offer peace of mind because I don't have to think much about taking it.\" Currently, her injections require careful preparation, such as disinfecting her entire counter with alcohol pads. Orforglipron's entrance into the market could also help the weight loss drug market reach more patients in the primary care setting who are not currently receiving treatment but could benefit from it, Seigerman said. While some primary care doctors can and do prescribe GLP-1s, others are hesitant due to concerns about side effects and administration since they are injections. He said the primary care part of the market is key for the weight loss drug market to hit Wall Street's lofty forecasts.\n\nAccessibility, pricing and insurance\n\nStill, Seigerman said he believes primary care providers who prescribe pills may still encounter issues with pricing and insurance coverage. He said he doesn't expect orforglipron to cost significantly less than existing injections because pharmaceutical products are \"typically priced by the value that they bring, regardless of the route of administration.\" For example, Rybelsus costs about $997 a month before insurance, the same list price as Ozempic. Risinger said he expects orforglipron to be priced at a slight discount to Zepbound, which means Eli Lilly's pill could cost significantly less than Wegovy. The list price of Wegovy \u2013 nearly $1,350 per month \u2013 is already around a 20% premium to Zepbound's list price of just under $1,100 per month, he said. That means if the pill costs 10% to 15% less than Zepbound, it would be almost a 30% to 35% discount compared to Wegovy, according to Risinger. But Risinger said he does not necessarily expect the pill to lead to better insurance coverage for obesity medications. He believes orforglipron will be covered by some plans like Zepbound is, but certain employers will likely still fear that some patients are only using obesity drugs for cosmetic purposes. Other employers are still balking at the high costs associated with covering those treatments. Jill Skala, a teacher in western Pennsylvania, said she would \"definitely consider\" taking a pill if it was less expensive than Zepbound and had \"equal efficacy or better.\" Skala, 49 is currently taking Zepbound and also has a nine-month supply of compounded tirzepatide, which she expects to use until the end of the year. \"I would probably just stay with Zepbound if [the pill] wasn't significantly less expensive, as long as Zepbound was still working for me,\" Skala told CNBC.\n\nTrial data expectations\n\nFotografiabasica | E+ | Getty Images\n\nSeveral analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to be as effective or slightly less than injectable semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, in phase three trials. In patients with obesity, that implies weight loss of around 13% to 15%, according to a February note from JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. That is in line with or slightly below Wegovy's 15% average weight loss in phase three trials. Eli Lilly's phase two trial examined different doses of the pill in overweight or obese patients, with a highest dose of 45 milligrams. But the company is only giving doses of up to 36 milligrams in phase three trials on orforglipron. Overweight or obese patients who took 36 milligrams of the pill once a day lost 13.5% of their body weight on average after 36 weeks in Eli Lilly's phase two trial. That compares with an average weight loss of 2.3% for people who received a placebo. Eli Lilly expects weight loss in people with diabetes to be \"significantly less\" than patients with obesity who don't have diabetes, the company's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on an earnings call in February. That's based on prior studies on orforglipron and other GLP-1 therapies, he noted. Schott said weight loss among diabetes patients could come in between 6% to 8%. He also expects hemoglobin A1c \u2013 a blood test that measures the average blood sugar level over the past two to three months \u2013 to improve by 1.8 to 2.1 points. That would be in line with results seen in diabetes patients who took Ozempic. In a phase two trial, orforglipron led to an HbA1c reduction of up to 2.1% at 26 weeks in adults with diabetes, compared to a decrease of 0.4% among those who took a placebo.\n\nLate-stage obesity trials, other studies on orforglipron ATTAIN-J \u2013 Study of orforglipron in Japanese adults with obesity\n\n\u2013 Study of orforglipron in Japanese adults with obesity ATTAIN-1 \u2013 Study of orforglipron in adults who have obesity or are overweight with weight-related comorbidities\n\n\u2013 Study of orforglipron in adults who have obesity or are overweight with weight-related comorbidities ATTAIN-2 \u2013 Study of orforglipron in adults who have obesity or are overweight and have Type 2 diabetes\n\n\u2013 Study of orforglipron in adults who have obesity or are overweight and have Type 2 diabetes ATTAIN-MAINTAIN \u2013 Study of orforglipron for the maintenance of body weight loss in patients who have obesity or are overweight with weight-related comorbidities\n\n\u2013 Study of orforglipron for the maintenance of body weight loss in patients who have obesity or are overweight with weight-related comorbidities ATTAIN-OSA \u2013 Study of orforglipron in people with obstructive sleep apnea and who have obesity or are overweight\n\nHowever, how well patients tolerate Eli Lilly's pill \u2013 specifically the rate of gastrointestinal side effects in the trial \u2013 will be the \"key focus\" of the phase three study results, according to Schott. It's an issue top of mind for doctors, patients and investors because side effects such as nausea and vomiting are a significant reason why some people stop taking the injections. Schott said the bar for orforglipron is nausea rates of less than 25% and vomiting rates in the low double digits for diabetes patients. He expects orforglipron to cause slightly worse rates of gastrointestinal side effects in patients with obesity. That could lead to \"tolerability worse than Zepbound but closer to Wegovy,\" Schott added. Orforglipron's nausea and vomiting rates in the phase two trial were \"meaningfully greater\" than those among patients who took 2-milligram doses of semaglutide in a phase three trial, Leerink's Risinger said. But he expects patients to tolerate Eli Lilly's pill better in phase three trials because they are longer in duration than the mid-stage studies and likely involve slower titration. That refers to how quickly patients start at a lower dose of a drug and ramp up to a higher target dose. On safety, Schott said he expects a \"very low probability\" of any issues that could put the entire development program for orforglipron at risk. He also believes it is highly unlikely that there will be any concerns related to liver toxicity \u2013 an issue that derailed one of Pfizer's experimental obesity pills.\n\nWhat the pill means for competitors\n\nPositive data on the pill and a potential approval would be a boon to Eli Lilly, but could also be good news for other companies developing oral GLP-1s, according to some analysts. Orforglipron's success could \"validate\" that administering a GLP-1 orally is possible, BMO's Seigerman said.",

The expansion project is planned for this year with the company expected to occupy the site in March 2026. (Submitted Rendering: Village of Pleasant Prairie)\n\nListen to this article Listen to this article\n\nPLEASANT PRAIRIE, Wis. \u2014 Eli Lilly and Company won final approval for site and operation plans for additions to its Pleasant Prairie facility. In December, the company announced an expansion in Kenosha County worth billions.\n\nThe Village Plan Commission approved final site and operational plans for a proposed addition to Eli Lilly\u2019s facility at 10300 128th Avenue in the Prairie Highlands Corporate Park, said Steven Linn, a spokesperson for Pleasant Prairie. The decision allows permits that are needed for construction to begin.\n\nEli Lilly scheduled its project start in February 2025 and is expected to occupy the new space in March 2026, a village staff report showed.\n\nThe project calls for a three-story office and manufacturing addition around 54,166 square feet on the west side of the building, village staff said. Included in the plans is a single-story addition to the north side of the warehouse of around 13,940 square feet and four new dock doors. There will be a 2,600-square-foot addition to the cafeteria area, staff added.\n\nIn late 2024, the commission greenlit preliminary site plans, including permits for grading, early footing and foundation and underground utilities.\n\nIn December, Eli Lilly announced a $3 billion expansion of its Kenosha County facility and add 750 jobs to the area. The proposal before the Plan Commission this week is not related to the greater project announced last year, an official at Eli Lilly said.\n\nEli Lilly bought the 128th Avenue facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in April 2024 and intends to carry out several future expansions focused on manufacturing injectable medicines addressing diabetes and obesity.\n\nIn December, Eli Lilly officials said the company spent $4 billion in Wisconsin acquiring, expanding and buying land. Since 2020, the company spent $23 billion building and acquiring manufacturing sites worldwide.\n\nIn Kenosha County, the Eli Lilly project is expected to create more than 2,000 construction jobs. It will also create automated manufacturing jobs as technology plays different roles in the production process.",

            "content": "There's a price war brewing in GLP-1 weight loss drugs, and now it's going global.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO -2.03%) stock slipped 1.7% through 12:10 a.m. ET Monday on a pair of news items with which investors seem less than thrilled:\n\nFirst, Novo Nordisk is expanding its program to sell Wegovy GLP-1 weight loss drugs at discounted prices. Second, Novo is spending $2 billion to license an entirely different GLP-1 drug from China.\n\nIn contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY 3.38%) and Hims & Hers Health (HIMS 7.63%) both jumped on today's news. They rose 2.7% and 7%, respectively.\n\nRolling back prices on Wegovy\n\nLet's take Novo Nordisk's news items one at a time, starting with Wegovy. Novo Nordisk announced earlier this month that its NovoCare Pharmacy would sell Wegovy direct to cash-paying consumers who don't use insurance to pay for their prescriptions. Each of the company's dose strengths would sell for $499 for a one-month supply. Today the company expanded the program, saying the $499 price will be available at local pharmacies, and not just for orders placed with NovoCare.\n\nPreviously, pharmacy cash sales were priced at $650 per month, so Novo has effectively cut prices by 23% for a big part of its market. Novo Nordisk investors may be worrying that Novo is losing market share, and may need to cut prices even further to compete with price cuts announced by Eli Lilly. Last month, Lilly cut the price of at least one dosage size of its competing Zepbound GLP-1 drug to $349, when purchased directly from Lilly.\n\nLong story short, investors seem to be reading this news as bad for Novo (less revenue and maybe losing market share), but correspondingly good for Eli Lilly, which is still underpricing its rival on at least one dosage.\n\nAt the same time, Hims & Hers Health stock is continuing to gain strength on the back of reports out last week, that the company's exit from the GLP-1 market may not be as imminent as feared. On Wednesday last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Hims & Hers \"will keep offering pharmacy-made, or compounded, versions of Ozempic and Wegovy tweaked to individual prescriptions.\"\n\nAs the Journal explained, \"current law ... allows compounding pharmacies to make special, individualized versions of drugs that aren't available commercially.\" So while Hims & Hers has benefited mightily from being able to mass market Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound lookalikes to fill a gap in supply from the drugs' inventors, and while that supply gap is going away, Hims & Hers may still be able to market copycat drugs in smaller quantities, and not be forced out of this market entirely after all. Such sales might even offer Hims & Hers better profit margins due to their personalization.\n\nNovo and Lilly obviously aren't happy about this, and have filed lawsuits seeking to force drug compounders like Hims & Hers out of the market. But for the time being this legal question remains unresolved -- and Hims & Hers remains in the GLP-1 business.\n\nNovo Nordisk goes big in China\n\nIn other news, Novo Nordisk announced today that has secured an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and market UBT251, a weight loss drug from China's The United Bio-Technology (Hengqin) Co. Novo describes UBT251 as \"a triple agonist of the receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon in early stage clinical development for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other diseases.\"\n\nNovo presumably hopes the three-pronged approach will perform even better than its current drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Novo will pay its Chinese partner $200 million up front, and may pay a further $1.8 billion over time. It's a relatively small bet that could pay off bigly for Novo if it works. But it also highlights Novo's recent failures to improve its own drugs' performance without help.\n\nCombined with positive news for Hims & Hers, and the potential threat to revenues from Novo lowering its prices, this helps explain why Novo Nordisk stock, in contrast to Eli Lilly and Hims & Hers, is losing ground today.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have scored big wins from the FDA in recent months, as the agency cracks down on copycat versions of their GLP-1 blockbusters. Now, as the battle with compound GLP-1s comes to an end, both pharma giants are ramping up their direct-to-consumer offerings in the obesity space.\n\nThe FDA declared last month that the shortage of semaglutide, the active ingredient for Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic, has been resolved \u2014 a decision that restricts pharmacies from manufacturing compounded versions of the drugs. The agency did the same for Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide, found in its obesity and diabetes meds Zepbound and Mounjaro, late last year.\n\nCompounded GLP-1s have been a source of contention for Lilly and Novo, which have both waged a legal war to prohibit copycats. Until recently, these versions were widely available through online pharmacies and telehealth providers at lower list prices than the brand names, eating into Lilly and Novo\u2019s obesity market share.\n\nAmid the latest blow to the cheaper compounded market, Lilly and Novo are bringing down prices to attract more patients.\n\nCompounders on their way out\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decisions will have a significant impact on the market for weight loss drugs. As many as 1 in 8 U.S. adults said they had tried a GLP-1 in a KFF poll last year, including many who turned to compounded versions. Direct-to-consumer wellness companies such as Ro, WeightWatchers and Hims & Hers added weight loss programs to their businesses, offering compounded GLP-1s for a fraction of the $1,000 monthly list price for Novo and Lilly\u2019s drugs. The on-and-off availability of compounded tirzepatide and semaglutide drugs has also impacted the stock market, triggering significant fluctuations in shares for Hims & Hers in particular. When the company first announced its weight loss program, its share price soared. But the recent FDA decisions have deeply cut into its value.\n\nDespite their widespread use, the clock has always been ticking on the availability of the compounded drugs, which the FDA only allows on the market when brand-name, agency-approved versions are in shortage.\n\n\u201cThey're just meeting a short-term need in the marketplace,\u201d said Kevin Shortsle, partner at law firm Howard & Howard.\n\nThe FDA ordered production of compounded tirzepatide to come to a halt on March 19. Now, manufacturers of compounded semaglutide will have to cease production by April 22.\n\nNovo and Lilly have both bulked up manufacturing capacity over the last few years to meet soaring demand. In February, Lilly announced plans to bolster its U.S.-based manufacturing with a $27 billion investment in four new sites, tacking on to the $23 billion it pumped into production capacity between 2020 and 2024.\n\nNovo closed its $16.5 billion takeover of drug manufacturer Catalent to help ramp up its GLP-1 production in December.\n\n\u201cThe pharma companies have seen [compounders] as a threat to their business, and what they've done is not only increase their production, but try to prevent it going forward so if another shortage arises they'll have the ability \u2026 to capture that market they were losing,\u201d Shortsle said.\n\nBut compound pharmacies aren\u2019t taking the FDA\u2019s shortage decision lying down. The Outsourcing Facilities Association, which represents compound manufacturers and pharmacies, is challenging both the tirzepatide and semaglutide decisions. The OFA called the FDA\u2019s delisting action on tirzepatide \u201carbitrary, without basis and contrary to law\u201d and argued the agency will \u201cdeprive much of the public access to a needed medicine.\u201d\n\nSo far, their lawsuits haven\u2019t overturned the decisions.\n\n\u201cI don't think that the compounders ultimately will be successful [in court], [but] they [may] drag on for some time,\u201d Shortsle said of the lawsuits.\n\nExpanding DTC reach\n\nWhile the compound fight winds down, Lilly and Novo are directing patients to their DTC channels \u2014 and competing more directly on out-of-pocket prices. Lilly made moves in the DTC arena first, launching its platform LillyDirect last year with a self-pay option for single-dose vials of Zepbound. The vials were priced at about 50% less than the list price for the pen injectors of Zepbound, the company said.\n\nLilly has since lowered the price for four-week supplies of its various Zepbound doses. The lowest-dose of Zepbound is now available for $349 per month, the company said.\n\nEarlier this month, Novo followed suit and began offering vial versions of Wegovy for an at-home delivery price of $499 per month through a platform called NovoCare.\n\nBecause the drugs are often not covered by insurance, the vials could improve access and fill the void left by compounded versions.\n\n\u201cAny way for [Novo and Lilly] to increase their market share through alternate channels is something they're going to look to do,\u201d Shortsle said.\n\nThese channels, however, aren\u2019t a sure bet. A group of senators began looking into LillyDirect and Pfizer\u2019s PfizerForAll platforms last year, aiming to find out more about the pharmas\u2019 relationships with contract telehealth prescribers. Earlier this month, the lawmakers expanded the probe to include another set of telehealth providers, and raised concerns about potential kickback violations and potential inappropriate prescribing.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nIn the most recent Mad Money episode, Jim Cramer shared his thoughts on the current state of the market, especially about AI stocks. He noted that despite the enthusiasm surrounding AI, investors are no longer willing to pay high prices for stocks tied to this technology. Cramer explained that on days like Tuesday, people in the market are feeling what he referred to as \u201cpainful shrinkage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this business, shrinkage means paying less for the same earnings that you were willing to pay up for only just a week or two ago.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 5 Stocks and Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks?\n\nHe pointed out that this phenomenon is commonly known as price-to-earnings multiple compression, a widespread trend across the market. Cramer asked why this is happening, especially when it seems like nothing has changed with the companies themselves. He explained:\n\n\u201cLook, when everyone\u2019s terrified that a piano\u2019s about to fall on their heads, they don\u2019t want to get hit by the baby grand and right now they don\u2019t want to own the falling stocks either. So they sell but they can\u2019t get a good price anymore because too many people want out for the same reasons. They think that stocks are overpriced versus when we consider what could lay ahead.\u201d\n\nCramer further elaborated that there is a strong sense of apprehension in the market right now, with investors bracing for potential economic challenges. Despite good news that may come out about companies or the economy, people are reluctant to hold onto stocks because they are anticipating weakness down the road.\n\nHe said that even though they cannot see it clearly, the ongoing concerns about the economy and the administration\u2019s messaging about necessary economic adjustments create a climate of fear. As Cramer put it, \u201cIf the administration keeps talking about how we\u2019re transitioning, how the economy needs to make some painful adjustments, then any big rally that we had Friday and yesterday will become magnets for sellers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: This latest round of multiple compression came on a day of wonderment about artificial intelligence, and even with Jensen\u2019s fabulous speech, multiple compression was just much more powerful. You know what? It\u2019s going to stay that way until we get through this environment, either because the White House backs off, or because stocks come down to the point where we simply get used to it.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 26, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 26th, 2024, market close to March 18th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nPlease note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 115\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical leader. In that older episode, Cramer noted Eli Lilly as a key player in the booming GLP-1 market.\n\n\u201cLilly\u2019s been part of the great broadening for a while now thanks to this revolutionary GLP-1 drug for weight loss and diabetes [\u2026] Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, which is their weight loss version of the GLP-1, is in extremely short supply all around the nation.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has climbed by 8.03% since Cramer highlighted it.\n\nOn the 11th of March, Cramer asserted his opinion that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is among the top 10 US companies:\n\n\u201cRemember Lilly passed Tesla, that\u2019s why remember the Magnificent 7 is the Okay 10 because I don\u2019t have seven.\u201d\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 16th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

            "content": "Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch \u2014 an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets: The markets are off to a strong start to the week and trying to build off the rebound that started on March 14. The S & P 500 bounced on Friday and finished the session in positive territory after President Donald Trump said his reciprocal tariff plan would have \"flexibility.\" While details were limited, this news was enough to lift stocks. Tariff optimism is similarly boosting the market Monday. On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's upcoming tariffs are expected to be narrower than anticipated, targeting specific industries and sectors instead of an across-the-board approach. To this point, Trump said on Monday afternoon that he will be announcing tariffs on autos \"very shortly\" and pharmaceutical tariffs could come soon. Additionally, some countries are expected to be excluded from tariffs, according to Bloomberg News . While the Trump administration's tariff plans are always subject to change \u2014 and the market moved off sessions highs after the auto comments \u2014 the market is rallying on easing concerns that trade policy won't be as broad and protectionist as previously feared. Eli Lilly : The health-care sector is lagging Monday in favor of tech and more cyclical stocks, but Eli Lilly shares are one of the biggest gainers in the group, up more than 2%. A slew of first-quarter previews were published Monday looking at what the Club holding may report. JPMorgan said it expects solid quarterly results for the pharmaceutical company. Although the analyst's first-quarter revenue forecast is $75 million below the Street consensus estimate, we don't think investors should be alarmed. It looks like the softness is coming from the legacy part of Lilly's portfolio. Where the sales matter most is in the GLP-1 part of the portfolio, and there JPMorgan is $285 million above consensus for sales of type 2 diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight-loss drug Zepbound, which are both once-weekly injectables. JPMorgan also pointed out a favorable risk-reward heading into one of the company's late-stage readouts for its oral GLP-1 known as orforglipron . The update is expected sometime in the second quarter, but JPMorgan wrote it could be announced when Eli Lilly reports its first-quarter results on May 1. In general, we're bullish on Eli Lilly's orforglipron, a once-daily pill that could expand the pool of potential GLP-1 patients and also be used in maintenance for people who transition off injectables. We believe it could be a multibillion market opportunity if its weight-loss efficacy is on par with Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and has a similar side-effect tolerability. Something to keep in mind, though: The first batch of late-stage orforglipron data is expected to be for a trial with type 2 diabetes patients, which generally show less weight loss from GLP-1s than people with only obesity. The tolerability data will be key with this first readout. A separate trial looking at the drug's efficacy in obese patients without diabetes is expected later in the year. Eli Lilly is clearly bullish on the drug's overall opportunity, too. As JPMorgan pointed out, Lilly recently disclosed it has built about $550 million worth of prelaunch inventory. The company wants to be ready to go if the drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration sometime in early 2026 . Up next: It's a slower week of earnings. Reporting after the closing bell Monday is homebuilder KB Home . Reporting before the opening bell Tuesday is McCormick . The earnings and commentary from the spice maker are always worth a listen because the company is the quintessential slowdown stock. When people are worried about the economy, they are more likely to cook at home instead of dining out. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

            "content": "It's hard to overstate how much demand could be out there for effective weight management drugs. The global anti-obesity drug market is expected to generate $12.8 billion in sales this year, and according to a new report from Research and Markets, sales could swell to $104.9 billion by 2035.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO -2.03%) markets the top-selling GLP-1 drug at the moment, but it has been losing market share to tirzepatide, a drug that Eli Lilly (LLY 3.38%) started marketing for weight management in 2023 under the brand name Zepbound.\n\nSales of Zepbound, administered via a weekly injection, are soaring, but a potential competitor from Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 1.14%) has been gaining a lot of attention. Mid-stage clinical trial data suggests Viking's candidate could outperform Lilly's blockbuster and become a new top-selling anti-obesity drug.\n\nWhich of these stocks is the better buy now? Here's what investors should know before adding either one to their portfolios.\n\nThe case for Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics shares rocketed to an all-time high last February after the company announced positive clinical trial results for its weight-management candidate, VK2735. This is a dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist similar to Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nIn a phase 2 trial, patients receiving VK2735 lost an average of 13.1% of their weight compared to those taking a placebo (and 14.7% from their baseline weights) after 13 weeks of treatment. That's a pretty good start, but the pivotal phase 3 studies that convinced the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve Zepbound ran for 72 weeks.\n\nThat 13.1% placebo-adjusted weight reduction at 13 weeks suggests VK2735 could outperform Lilly's drug. The best result from pivotal studies supporting Zepbound's approval was a placebo-adjusted reduction of 17.8% after 72 weeks.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are peptide hormones that get sliced up into individual amino acids the moment they reach your stomach. They're small enough, though, to be administerable orally with some tinkering. In March 2024, investors were highly encouraged by a 3.3% placebo-adjusted average weight loss result after 28 days for patients in a phase 1 trial of an oral version of VK2735.\n\nShares of Viking Therapeutics have dropped by about 70% from the peak they reached last year because the company has been dragging its feet. It still hasn't started a phase 3 trial for VK2735 despite reporting successful phase 2 results more than a year ago. And VK2735 isn't the only candidate moving through Viking's pipeline much more slowly than it probably should.\n\nIn November 2023, the company reported successful phase 2 results for VK2809, its candidate treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The candidate successfully reduced patients' liver fat content, but the company still hasn't begun the phase 3 trial it needs to run before the FDA will consider approving it.\n\nThe case for Eli Lilly\n\nZepbound is Eli Lilly's biggest growth driver at the moment, but it isn't the only drug pushing total sales higher for this well-established pharmaceutical giant. Its fourth-quarter revenue not related to GLP-1 drugs grew by 20% year over year. Sales of Verzenio, a targeted breast-cancer therapy grew 36% year over year to an annualized $6.2 billion.\n\nIncluding sales of both tirzepatide brands -- Zepbound for obesity, and Mounjaro for diabetes -- fourth-quarter revenue soared 45% year over year to $13.5 billion.\n\nYet even as overall sales have been growing at a torrid pace, Eli Lilly stock has fallen by about 11% from its peak. At recent prices, you can scoop it up for about 36.5 times the midpoint of management's guided range for adjusted earnings this year. That's a fair valuation for any company that you can expect to grow sales by around 10% annually in the coming decade. Eli Lilly expects total sales to grow by 32% in 2025.\n\nIn addition to both tirzepatide brands, Lilly expects increasing contributions from four recently launched therapies: Jaypirca, Ebglyss, Omvoh, and Kisunla. It also looks like this big pharma giant will own the top obesity drug for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf Viking Therapeutics starts a phase 3 trial for VK2735 tomorrow, it will still be more than a year behind retatrutide, an experimental triple hormone receptor agonist that Lilly is developing for weight management. In 2023, we learned that retatrutide reduced patients' average weight by up to 24.2% after 48 weeks. The well-run pharma giant began four phase 3 trials for retatrutide in 2023 before announcing its phase 2 success. A big one studying it as an obesity treatment (Triumph-4) is expected to produce top-line results before the end of 2025.\n\nThe better stock to buy now\n\nPre-commercial drugmakers like Viking Therapeutics are only appropriate investments for folks who have a high-risk tolerance. Even if you have a sky-high risk tolerance, it would probably be best to avoid buying shares of Viking Therapeutics until it quits dragging its feet and starts behaving like a drugmaker that has confidence in its pipeline. Waiting for more than a year to begin a pivotal study after delivering excellent phase 2 data is unacceptable.\n\nEli Lilly is trading at a high valuation for a big pharma company, but it's in a position to grow much faster than its peers. As a well-established pharmaceutical giant with diverse revenue streams, it's highly likely to produce a positive return over the long run. If it stays on top of the market for weight-management drugs, though, patient investors could realize market-beating gains. That makes it the better stock to buy now by a mile.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nDuring the latest episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised his viewers to closely monitor the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and the earnings reports from companies. However, he also cautioned that irrespective of what the earnings reveal, the direction of the market will largely be determined by President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe also mentioned that Tuesday will bring the release of February housing data, which Cramer emphasized as significant. He stressed that a strong housing market is essential in preventing a recession, which he described as \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 7 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer Talked About These 7 Stocks Recently\n\n\u201cAny kind of slowdown is quickly reflected in housing, which then gets reflected in retail. It\u2019s a delicate chain that starts with housing, which is why I\u2019ll be watching these numbers like a hawk.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s events are also of importance, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee will meet, and the market will hear from Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chair. Cramer noted that the most recent inflation data, including both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, have been relatively favorable, which might suggest that inflation is under control. However, he cautioned that certain areas of the economy still experience persistent high prices.\n\nFurthermore, as per Cramer, there is a looming possibility of a new round of tariffs, potentially as soon as next week, which could include a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, perhaps on those from Germany, Japan, and South Korea. He then added:\n\n\u201cI fear the president will choose Wednesday to lower the boom so be prepared. Sure, the market\u2019s oversold. It may stay oversold by Wednesday so it could possibly handle any auto-related tariff news, but you have to be ready for them.\u201d\n\nFinally, Cramer reiterated that the fate of the market this week will hinge more on actions from the White House and the Federal Reserve than on the earnings reports of individual companies.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 22, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 22, 2024, market close to March 14th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nPlease note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nWhen a caller asked Cramer whether they should buy Novo Nordisk stock, Cramer advocated for buying Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) instead:\n\n\u201cI think you should buy Lilly instead because Lilly\u2019s going to have in the next three months some very good news on its anti-dementia drug. And Novo doesn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has risen by almost 7% since then, while Novo Nordisk has sunk by almost 40%. This was a great call by Cramer.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said on the 25th of February this year:\n\n\u201cI cannot believe it\u2019s for the high dose! And, that means, the high does is, they\u2019ve come down a lot in price. But now they\u2019re gonna come down for everybody. So Lilly\u2019s back, it\u2019s bigger than ever, it\u2019s making a major move. . . but Eli Lilly cutting the price is gonna make it so that it is dramatically good. \u201cLilly\u2019s got the low price, Lilly\u2019s got the big, but remember, it\u2019s the big dose, okay.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

Mounjaro is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u201cThe dual burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes is rapidly emerging as a major public health challenge in India. Lilly is committed to collaborating with the government and industry to promote awareness and improve the prevention and management of these diseases,\u201d said Winselow Tucker, President and General Manager, Lilly India. \u201cOur mission to making life better for people living with obesity and diabetes in India is reflected in our efforts to accelerate the introduction of innovative medicines. The launch of Mounjaro demonstrates our ongoing support to this mission and our shared vision of a healthier nation.\u201d\n\nIndia has about 101 million people living with diabetes and nearly half of these in the adult patients category are being inadequately treated with suboptimal glycemic control.10 Obesity, a chronic relapsing disease, is a major risk factor for diabetes, is linked to over 200 health complications, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. As of 2023, adult obesity prevalence in India stood at around 6.5%, affecting nearly 100 million people.\n\n\u201cObesity and diabetes are recognized as serious conditions linked to various life-limiting health complications, making effective and sustained treatment critical. We are thrilled to introduce Mounjaro in India to address these unmet medical needs. Mounjaro\u00ae may offer a new approach to metabolic health management, providing healthcare providers with an innovative option to treat these diseases.\u201d said Dr. Manish Mistry, Senior Medical Director, Lilly India.\n\nOnce-a-weekly, prescription-based medicine, Mounjaro is a single molecule that selectively binds to and activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, which are natural incretin hormones. In a glucose-dependent manner, Mounjaro improves first phase and second phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels; it also improves insulin sensitivity and delays gastric emptying.",

It received approval from India\u2019s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), and was released on Thursday (March 20).\n\nA 2.5 mg vial of Mounjaro is priced at Rs 3,500 and the 5 mg vial costs Rs 4,375.\n\nThe drug is currently sold in the UK and Europe under the same name for both weight loss and diabetes, and is sold as \u2018Zepbound\u2019 for obesity in the US.\n\nAlso read: One out of every 4 diabetes patients in the world lived in India in 2022: Lancet study\n\nClaimed benefits\n\nThe company said that this drug can be obtained from pharmacies with a doctor\u2019s prescription. A month\u2019s therapy with this drug would cost between Rs 14,000 to Rs 17,500, according to reports.\n\nThe company said it is a \u2018first-of-its-kind treatment\u2019 for obesity and Type-2 diabetes which activates both the GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone receptors that are essential to regulate blood sugar levels and appetite of an individual.\n\nWatch: World Diabetes Day: What is Diabetic Retinopathy and how can it cause vision loss\n\nMounjaro is said to improve first and second phase insulin secretion and reduces glucagon levels. It also improves insulin sensitivity and delays gastric emptying. By doing so, it reduces food intake, body weight and decreases fat mass by regulating appetite and making people feel more full. It is also shown to have regulated lipid utilisation, according to reports.\n\n'Improves diabetes'\n\nConsultant Diabetologist at Dr Mohan\u2019s Diabetes Specialities Centre, Dr V Vinod Babu V, spoke to The Federal on this. \u201cWith the launch of this new drug, Mounjaro, known as tirzepatide, there is a big change in the landscape of [the] management of diabetes and obesity as we know it, because, this is a drug which helps in losing weight very easily. Many people who are trying to lose weight and are unable to do so because of restrictive diets [or] are unable to focus on their lifestyles\u2026 can easily lose weight, and rapidly as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn an average, half of the participants in this trial have lost 20 per cent of their current body weight, and naturally since diabetes is an obesity-dependent condition \u2014 the diabetes also improves much earlier than before the people even lose [their] weight.\u201d\n\nDr Vinod added that common side effects include gastrointestinal issue, which is something the majority of people who took the drug have tolerated.\n\nAlso read: This rice variety could tackle diabetes epidemic in South India\n\nRevolutionary drug\n\nAccording to Dr Vinod, this drug \u201c...is going to revolutionise the way we look at diabetes and obesity management,\u201d he mentioned that patients can get off their current existing medications or insulin and maintain themselves with a weekly injection of Mounjaro.\n\n\u201cThe safety of this drug has been well-studied,\u201d he added \u201cThis drug, if anything, has been proven to increase the lifespan of a human being in addition to reducing obesity and its associated complications.\u201d\n\nIndia, considered the 'diabetes capital of the world', has over 100 million people suffering the disease.",

            "content": "([content-module:CompanyOverview, NYSE: ABBV\n\nAbbVie Inc. ABBV is trading near an all-time high after the company announced a licensing agreement with Gubra, a Danish company. The agreement pertains to Gubra\u2019s experimental weight loss drug, which is in a Phase 1 trial.\n\nAbbVie paid Gubra a $350 million upfront payment for the right to its experimental weight loss drug, GUB014295, which is in a Phase 1 trial. AbbVie has committed to paying Gubra up to $1.9 billion based on certain development and sales milestones that are met.\n\nBut the move higher after this announcement just continues the bullish pattern in place with ABBV stock, which has been up more than 19% since the start of the year. Analyst sentiment suggests the stock still has room to run higher.\n\nHow Gubra Is Different From Existing Competition\n\nEntering the weight loss market makes sense for AbbVie when you consider that analysts believe the weight loss drug market could be worth $130 billion by 2030. Currently Novo Nordisk A/S NVO with Ozempic and Eli Lilly and Co. LLY with Zepbound are the major players. And like those two drugs, GUB014295 (also known as GUBamy) is an injectable drug.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that GUBamy offers a distinct difference that Gubra believes will be an advantage. Both Ozempic and Zepbound target the GLP-1 hormone. By contrast, GUBamy acts as an analog of the body\u2019s amylin hormone.\n\nAmylin has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for obesity treatment. The hormone gives patients\u2019 brains a feeling of fullness that helps suppress appetite, reduce food intake, and delays gastric emptying. The optimism is that GUBamy may provide a more long-lasting solution to weight management. In results from Gubra\u2019s six-week Phase 1 study in 2024, patients achieved 3% weight loss after a single dose.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Who\u2019s Selling, It\u2019s Who\u2019s Buying\n\nIn February, the AbbVie Insider Trades on MarketBeat show three different AbbVie executives sold the company\u2019s stock in February. Retail investors frequently assign too much importance when company insiders sell stock. In this case, each trade was executed pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.\n\nA Rule 10b5-1 plan is a written agreement between a corporate insider and a broker, establishing predetermined trading instructions with a predetermined share price, amount, and transaction date. In each case, these plans were made in November 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s a good reminder that investors, even corporate insiders, sell stock for a variety of reasons. But there\u2019s usually only one reason they\u2019re buying. And in the last 12 months, six different members of Congress have bought ABBV stock. And as investors know, Congressional trading doesn\u2019t have the same oversight as a Rule 10b5-1 plan when it comes to potential insider trading.\n\nAnalysts Are Raising Their Price Targets\n\n([content-module:DividendStats, NYSE: ABBV\n\nSince the announcement in early March, AbbVie stock reached an all-time high at over $216 per share. The stock has fallen back to around $212 as of this writing, and some investors are concerned about the stock\u2019s trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is 88x.\n\nHowever, AbbVie\u2019s forward P/E is only around 17x, which is slightly below the company\u2019s ten-year average of around 20x. That suggests that rather than being expensive, ABBV stock may be trading at a discount to its historical average and the average of other stocks in the biopharmaceutical and medical sector.\n\nThat seems to be the consensus of the analyst community. Since the announcement of the deal with Gubra, two analyst firms, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, have raised their price targets on ABBV stock to $223 and $240, respectively. Erste Group Bank upgraded the stock to a Strong Buy.\n\nInvestors looking to get involved will want to see if other analysts raise their outlook before AbbVie reports earnings in April. Even if you feel the stock is too expensive, you may want to consider starting a position simply to collect the company\u2019s dividend, which currently pays $6.56 per share annually.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"AbbVie Stock Boosts Portfolios With Entry Into Weight Loss Market\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best Robinhood stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management has announced quarterly retail investor pulse survey results. The majority of investors\u2019 views were bullish. Investors began the year on the bullish (58%) note, in line with last quarter (59%). Furthermore, the results also revealed that around 2 out of 3 investors (64%) saw the market rising by the end of the quarter.\n\nWhat\u2019s On Retail Investors\u2019 Minds?\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management\u2019s survey revealed that inflation has been the top worry for investors\u2019 portfolios at 45%, almost in line with the last quarter at 46%, with market volatility at 24% coming out to be the second. Notably, the concerns related to the new administration declined 13 percentage points since the last quarter. Furthermore, around 3 out of 5 (59%) of investors see that the broader US economy remains healthy. Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, stated that with any new administration taking power, the potential policy changes can bring uncertainty in the broader markets. That being said, investors are optimistic and resilient amid a soft start to the new year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nCurrent Trends in Retail Investing\n\nRetail outflows from the US equities increased to ~$4 billion over the previous 2 weeks due to the uncertainties related to tariffs and increased economic concerns, which resulted in a strong pullback in the S&P 500, reported CNBC, while quoting data from Barclays. Rob Austin, director of research at Alight Solutions, says that if people tried to buy the dip, there would have been evidence hinting at the increased buying of the large-cap equities. On the contrary, people are selling large-cap equities. Austin believes that this seems to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity.\n\nCNBC, while highlighting the comments made by Venu Krishna (Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy), reported that there remains sufficient capacity for the retail investors to further disengage from the broader equity market. Notably, Barclays\u2019 proprietary euphoria indicator exhibited that the sentiments are down to the levels that were seen around the time of the US election back in November, but remain elevated by historic standards. The increased sell-off came as American households remained more sensitive than ever to the significant volatility in the broader equity markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 8 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we sifted through several online rankings to shortlist the stocks trending on Robinhood. We also took help from the Robinhood Investor Index. Next, we chose the ones that analysts see significant upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of March 17. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~23.4%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 115\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) discovers, develops, and markets human pharmaceuticals. Moody\u2019s Ratings believes that the company has healthy scale and solid competitive position, higher profit margins, and strong cash flow. Furthermore, rapidly growing products such as Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio, Ebglyss, and Kisunla, are expected to sustain strong growth. The firm expects Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to maintain conservative financial policies over time. Analyst Nico Chen from DBS maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, keeping the price objective at $900.00. The rating is backed by a combination of factors demonstrating its promising growth prospects. One critical reason is its strong pipeline.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst lauded Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s existing products in the weight-loss segment, like Mounjaro and Zepbound, which have contributed significantly to its revenue. For Q4 2024, worldwide Mounjaro revenue rose 60% to $3.53 billion and the U.S. Zepbound revenue came in at $1.91 billion against $175.8 million in Q4 2023. Also, the healthy market performance of such drugs was strengthened by the clinical superiority over the competitors, says the analyst. Elsewhere, Citi maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating with a price objective of $1,190.00.\n\nParnassus Investments, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)stock declined following worse-than-expected third quarter results for its weight-loss drug segment. We initiated our position partway through the quarter, after the drawdown and in time for a partial rebound, and our average underweight for the quarter led to a relative contribution. In the Health Care sector, we added drugmaker Eli Lilly, which has an exceptional GLP-1 franchise and a strong track record of innovation, which position the company for long-term growth. A rare revenue miss and President-elect Trump\u2019s health secretary nomination sparked a sell-off, providing a window of opportunity to gain exposure to the drugmaker\u2019s attractive product suite and pipeline at an attractive valuation.\u201d\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 5th on our list of best Robinhood stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company (India) has officially launched Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in the Indian market following marketing authorization from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). This innovative, once-a-week injectable therapy is designed for chronic weight management and type 2 diabetes treatment, offering a unique mechanism of action that targets both GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptors.\n\nTransforming Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Care\n\nMounjaro represents a first-of-its-kind therapy, leveraging dual incretin receptor activation to aid weight loss and glycemic control. The drug is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for adults with:\n\nObesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater)\n\nOverweight (BMI of 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular conditions.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus , as a supplement to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control.\n\nThe company has introduced Mounjaro in single-dose vials in 5 mg vial and 2.5 mg vials.\n\nAddressing India\u2019s Rising Burden of Metabolic Disorders\n\nIndia faces a significant dual burden of diabetes and obesity, with over 101 million people diagnosed with diabetes and nearly 100 million affected by obesity. Many adults struggle with suboptimal glycemic control, making innovative treatment options like Mounjaro crucial in managing these conditions effectively.\n\nWinselow Tucker, President and General Manager, Lilly India, emphasized the company\u2019s dedication to improving healthcare outcomes. He stated, \u201cOur mission to enhance the quality of life for individuals dealing with obesity and diabetes in India is reflected in our commitment to delivering groundbreaking medicines. The introduction of Mounjaro is a testament to this mission and our goal of fostering a healthier nation.\u201d\n\nClinical Validation and Efficacy\n\nMounjaro has been extensively evaluated through global clinical programs, including SURMOUNT-1 trials, which focused on chronic weight management and SURPASS trials, which examined its effectiveness in type 2 diabetes treatment.\n\nThe drug has demonstrated the ability to reduce food intake, body weight, and fat mass while improving metabolic parameters, including lipid utilization. Studies indicate that patients receiving Mounjaro experience significant improvements in glycemic control, weight reduction, and appetite regulation.\n\nAlso Read: Narayana Health, W Health Ventures, and 2070 Health Join Forces to Launch Everhope Oncology with $10M Seed Investment\n\nA Step Forward in Metabolic Health\n\nObesity, recognized as a chronic, relapsing disease, is associated with over 200 health complications, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nDr. Manish Mistry, Senior Medical Director, Lilly India, highlighted the need for innovative treatments, stating, \u201cObesity and diabetes pose severe health risks, necessitating effective and sustained treatment solutions. Mounjaro offers healthcare providers a powerful tool to address these challenges and revolutionize metabolic health management.\u201d\n\nAs Eli Lilly continues to expand its portfolio in India, the launch of Mounjaro signifies a major milestone in tackling diabetes and obesity. With its once-weekly administration and dual receptor action, it is poised to offer a novel therapeutic approach for millions struggling with these metabolic conditions.\n\nLike Dislike\n\nBe a part of Elets Collaborative Initiatives.

            "content": "Eli Lilly 's blockbuster drug 'Mounjaro' was launched in India on Thursday. The pharma manufacturer said it has launched a first-of-its-kind medication for obesity and type 2 diabetes in the country after obtaining approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The company said it has introduced Mounjaro in a single-dose vial presentation following the marketing authorisation from the CDSCO.Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition. It is a first-of-its-kind treatment for obesity, overweight, and type 2 diabetes that activates both GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone receptors.\"The dual burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes is rapidly emerging as a major public health challenge in India. Lilly is committed to collaborating with the government and industry to promote awareness and improve the prevention and management of these diseases,\" Eli Lilly India President and General Manager Winselow Tucker said.The introduction of Mounjaro is a ray of hope for India, as over 100 million people are already affected with diabetes and a major part of the population is obese. Obesity, a chronic relapsing disease, is a major risk factor for diabetes and is linked to over 200 health complications, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and obstructive sleep apnea.While Mounjaro's introduction to the Indian market seems to have a positive impact in the fight against obesity, one should also be careful about the side effects.Several experts have welcomed the drug and have also spoken about its side effects. For example, Dr Keith Siau took to X to share the side effects of Mounjaro . \"GLP1 receptor agonists such as Mounjaro / Ozempic are now easily purchasable without a prescription, but watch out for side effects,\" he has posted on X.Many users experience gastrointestinal discomfort, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. These side effects are usually mild and improve over time as the body adjusts. Loss of appetite is another common effect, which contributes to weight loss but may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.Some individuals may develop pancreatitis , a serious condition marked by severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. There is also a risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially if Mounjaro is taken alongside insulin or other diabetes medications. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, and confusion.Gallbladder issues, such as gallstones or gallbladder inflammation, have been reported in some users. Additionally, there is a potential but rare risk of thyroid tumors, as observed in animal studies. While human studies have not confirmed this risk, those with a history of thyroid cancer should exercise caution.Individuals with pancreatitis, thyroid disorders, severe gastrointestinal conditions, or gallbladder disease should consult a doctor before taking Mounjaro. Regular monitoring and lifestyle adjustments can help minimize risks.Tirzepatide was evaluated in two robust global clinical development programs: the SURMOUNT - 1 trials for chronic weight management and the SURPASS trials for type 2 diabetes.In SURMOUNT-1, a study in 2,539 adults with obesity, or excess weight and weight-related medical problems not including diabetes, people taking Mounjaro as an adjunct to diet and exercise experienced substantial weight loss compared with placebo at 72 weeks. At the highest dose (15 mg), people taking Mounjaro lost on average 21.8 kg, while at the lowest dose (5 mg), people lost on average 15.4 kg (compared to 3.2 kg on placebo).1,2 Additionally, 1 in 3 patients taking Mounjaro at the highest dose lost over 26.3 kg (25% of body weight), compared to 1.5% on placebo, according to data not controlled for type 1 error.1,2 In summary, Mounjaro significantly reduced weight by up to 21.8 kg in the SURMOUNT-1 study.In phase 3 SURPASS program, efficacy was evaluated for Mounjaro 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg used alone or in combination with commonly prescribed diabetes medications, including metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas and insulin glargine. Participants in the SURPASS program achieved average A1C reductions between 1.8% and 2.1% for Mounjaro\u00ae 5 mg and between 1.7% and 2.4% for both Mounjaro 10 mg and Mounjaro 15 mg over the period of 40 weeks.3-6 Overall, the program demonstrated that Mounjaro, whether used alone or with other diabetes medications, reduced A1C by up to 2.4%.\u201cObesity and diabetes are recognized as serious conditions linked to various life-limiting health complications, making effective and sustained treatment critical. We are thrilled to introduce Mounjaro in India to address these unmet medical needs. Mounjaro may offer a new approach to metabolic health management, providing healthcare providers with an innovative option to treat these diseases.\u201d said Dr. Manish Mistry, Senior Medical Director, Lilly India.",

            "content": "Weight loss injections have taken centrestage in the last few months, with Ozempic (semaglutide) leading the charge. Initially developed for diabetes management, these drugs quickly gained popularity for their ability to help patients lose significant weight. Social media, celebrity endorsements, and the promise of effortless weight loss have fueled their meteoric rise, leading to an increased demand worldwide.\n\nThe latest in this category to enter India is Mounjaro. Global pharma giant Eli Lilly has launched Mounjaro (tirzepatide) at a price point significantly lower than its international cost. The 2.5 mg vial is set at \u20b93,500, while the 5 mg vial is priced at \u20b94,375. Mounjaro will soon be available in registered pharmacies across India with a valid prescription.\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly has launched Mounjaro in India (ETV Bharat)\n\nMounjaro has been evaluated in two Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and has demonstrated positive results. Clinical trials show that individuals with obesity but no diabetes experienced a 15% to 22% reduction in body weight, while those with both obesity and diabetes saw an average 15% weight loss. \u201cIf used early in obesity-related disorders like fatty liver, dyslipidemia, or type 2 diabetes, it can lead to remission in these comorbidities,\u201d says Dr. Rajiv Kovil, Head of Diabetology, Zandra Healthcare and Co-founder of Rang De Neela Initiative.\n\nSide Effects and Contraindications\n\nThe Indian launch price of Mounjaro is significantly lower than its international counterparts, making it an attractive option for those struggling with obesity. However, experts caution that these medications are not meant to be a shortcut to fitness. While they can be effective tools for weight management, they must be used alongside lifestyle changes to ensure long-term success. While the availability of Mounjaro is promising, Dr. Kovil also advocates for a larger policy shift:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the government declares obesity as a medical disorder and creates an environment that encourages healthy eating and physical activity. Healthier food options should be cheaper, while unhealthy options should be taxed. Investments in health, such as gym memberships, should receive tax rebates,\u201d says Dr. Kovil.\n\nMounjaro\u2019s benefits are undeniable, but what\u2019s the cost beyond its price tag? Like many weight-loss drugs, tirzepatide is not free from potential downsides. Most of its side effects are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, there are serious contraindications. The drug is not recommended for those with a history of pancreatitis or those with a family history of thyroid cancer.\n\nUnintended Consequences\n\nWhile these weight-loss drugs have been hailed as game-changers, they have also sparked concerns due to emerging reports of serious side effects. American singer Avery recently revealed that after a year of regular use, she developed bone-thinning diseases, raising alarms about long-term risks.\n\nReal Housewives of Atlanta star Kandi Burruss admitted that she joined the Ozempic bandwagon but saw no results. \u201cI saw so many people losing weight, so I tried it. But I didn\u2019t lose any weight at all,\u201d she said. Her experience contradicts the popular belief that these drugs guarantee weight loss for everyone.\n\nRnB singer Macy Gray was hospitalized due side effects of Ozempic. She said, \u201cOh boy, my stomach hurts. I\u2019ve just been really constipated. I took Ozempic. I can\u2019t go to the bathroom, and I was up all night.\u201d Reality star Kim Zolciak responded, \u201cOzempic does that. You have to be really careful.\u201d\n\nBeyond digestive issues, Ozempic and similar drugs have been linked to more serious concerns, including Ozempic hair loss: a side effect where users experience thinning or excessive shedding due to rapid weight loss and nutrient deficiencies. Another growing concern is Ozempic blindness: a term used to describe reports of sudden vision loss or worsening eye health, possibly linked to the medication\u2019s effect on blood flow and nerve function.\n\nNot A One-Size-Fits-All Solution\n\nWhile Mounjaro has shown incredible efficacy, it is not a magic bullet. \u201cManagement of obesity needs a comprehensive approach with holistic healing, which includes adherence to lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, and sometimes medications,\u201d Dr. Kovil says. Weight loss drugs, no matter how powerful, cannot replace the fundamental principles of healthy eating, regular exercise and sustainable lifestyle habits.\n\nSources:",

            "content": "Eli Lilly has officially launched Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) in India, making it the first major weight-loss and diabetes drug of its kind to enter the country. This move places Eli Lilly ahead of rival Novo Nordisk, whose weight-loss drug Wegovy is yet to debut in the Indian market. With India facing a dual epidemic of obesity and diabetes, the availability of Mounjaro could have significant implications for millions of patients.\n\nMounjaro is a once-weekly injection that has already been approved by India\u2019s drug regulator. It is priced at:\n\n\u20b94,375 ($50.67) for a 5 mg vial\n\n\u20b93,500 ($40.54) for a 2.5 mg vial\n\nA patient in India could spend around \u20b916,000 ($200) per month if prescribed a 5 mg dose.

Mounjaro\u2019s dual action on GLP-1 and GIP receptors sets it apart from Ozempic (Semaglutide), which only targets GLP-1.\n\nLike any medication, Mounjaro comes with potential risks.\n\n\u201cCommon side effects are gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and acid reflux. In some cases, severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration and acute kidney injury,\u201d Dr Arora said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nShe added that rapid weight loss may also contribute to gallbladder-related conditions like gallstones (cholelithiasis) and gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).\n\nWho can take Mounjaro?\n\nDr Arora explains that Mounjaro is suitable for:\n\n\u2705 Adults with Type 2 diabetes who need better blood sugar control.\n\n\u2705 Obese or overweight individuals struggling with weight loss.\n\n\u2705 Patients with insulin resistance who haven\u2019t responded well to other treatments.\n\nThese people must avoid the drug, as per Dr Arora:\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n\u274c Pregnant women and children.\n\n\u274c Patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u274c Individuals with a history of pancreatitis or thyroid cancer (MEN2 syndrome).\n\n\u274c Those with severe gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nShe added that Mounjaro is strictly contraindicated for individuals with a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2) syndrome.\n\nThe global weight-loss drug market is expected to reach $150 billion in the next decade.

The company confirmed that Wegovy has already been approved in India, but its launch timeline remains uncertain. Reports suggest that Novo\u2019s India team is pushing for a 2025 launch, ahead of the global target of 2026.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nBoth Wegovy and Ozempic (Semaglutide) belong to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class of drugs, which help control blood sugar and aid in weight loss. However, Mounjaro\u2019s additional GIP action gives it an edge in weight management.\n\nThe global weight-loss drug market is expected to reach $150 billion in the next decade. By 2026, semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) will go off-patent in India, allowing local firms to introduce cheaper alternatives.\n\nDiabetes and obesity: A growing health crisis in India\n\nIndia is home to over 1.4 billion people, and the country is seeing a rapid rise in both obesity and diabetes.\n\nDiabetes cases are projected to increase from 74.2 million in 2021 to 124 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation. A government survey, from 2019 to 2021, found that 24% of women and 23% of men (ages 15\u201349) are overweight or obese\u2014a sharp increase from 2015\u20132016 levels (20.6% women, 19% men).\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nGiven these alarming figures, the entry of drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy could be a game-changer in addressing India\u2019s public health crisis.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

            "content": "Synopsis : US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (India) launched its globally acclaimed drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in the country. Mounjaro, whose active ingredient is tirzepatide, works by activating two key hormones \u2014 GIP (Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide) and GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) \u2014 to control blood sugar levels and appetite.\n\nTo address India\u2019s escalating diabetes and obesity epidemic, US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (India) launched its globally acclaimed drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide) on Thursday, 20 March. The company has priced the doses at \u20b93,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and \u20b94,375 for a 5 mg vial. The monthly cost for the lowest dose amounts to \u20b914,000.\n\nThe once-weekly injection, approved by India\u2019s drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), undercuts US prices by over 95 percent, positioning the company ahead of rival Novo Nordisk which produces Ozampic in the race to dominate one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing healthcare markets.\n\nIn comparison, Lilly\u2019s US consumers spend around $499 (approximately \u20b943,000) per month for Zepbound, its obesity-specific version of tirzepatide.\n\nAlso Read: IISc successfully uses light and sound to make diabetes tests painless\n\nHow it works\n\nMounjaro, whose active ingredient is tirzepatide, works by activating two key hormones \u2014 GIP (Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide) and GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) \u2014 to control blood sugar levels and appetite.\n\nIt is approved as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m\u00b2 or greater (obesity) or 27 kg/m\u00b2 or greater (overweight) with at least one weight-related comorbid condition.\n\nIt is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u201cThe dual burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes is rapidly emerging as a major public health challenge in India. Lilly is committed to collaborating with the government and industry to promote awareness and improve the prevention and management of these diseases,\u201d said Winselow Tucker, President and General Manager, Lilly India in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur mission to make life better for people living with obesity and diabetes in India is reflected in our efforts to accelerate the introduction of innovative medicines. The launch of Mounjaro demonstrates our ongoing support for this mission and our shared vision of a healthier nation.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s aggressive pricing strategy in India reflects both the country\u2019s price-sensitive market and the urgency to tackle a dual public health crisis. Over 101 million Indians live with diabetes, while obesity affects nearly 100 million.\n\nNearly half of India\u2019s adult diabetic population struggles with suboptimal glycemic control. Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes and is associated with over 200 health complications, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, coronary heart disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea. As of 2023, adult obesity prevalence in India was approximately 6.5 percent, affecting nearly 100 million people.\n\n\u201cObesity and diabetes are recognised as serious conditions linked to various life-limiting health complications, making effective and sustained treatment critical. We are thrilled to introduce Mounjaro in India to address these unmet medical needs. Mounjaro may offer a new approach to metabolic health management, providing healthcare providers with an innovative option to treat these diseases,\u201d said Dr Manish Mistry, Senior Medical Director, Lilly India in a statement.\n\nMounjaro is a once-weekly, prescription-based treatment that selectively binds to and activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In a glucose-dependent manner, it improves first- and second-phase insulin secretion reduces glucagon levels, enhances insulin sensitivity, and delays gastric emptying.\n\nGIP and GLP-1 receptors are present in brain regions that regulate appetite, and Mounjaro reduces food intake, body weight, and fat mass by modulating appetite and lipid utilisation. The drug has already been introduced in global markets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\nScience and efficacy: A game-changer for chronic conditions\n\nTirzepatide has been evaluated in two global clinical development programmes: The SURMOUNT-1 trial for chronic weight management and the SURPASS programme for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe SURMOUNT-1 study included 2,539 adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical conditions, excluding diabetes. Participants receiving Mounjaro alongside diet and exercise experienced significant weight loss compared with placebo at 72 weeks.\n\nThose on the highest dose (15 mg) lost an average of 21.8 kg, while those on the lowest dose (5 mg) lost an average of 15.4 kg, compared to 3.2 kg on placebo. Additionally, one in three patients on the highest dose lost over 26.3 kg (25% of body weight), compared to just 1.5 percent on placebo.\n\nThe SURPASS programme evaluated the efficacy of Mounjaro in doses of five mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, used alone or in combination with commonly prescribed diabetes medications such as metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin glargine.\n\nOver 40 weeks, participants achieved A1C reductions between 1.8 percent and 2.1 percent for Mounjaro five mg, and between 1.7 percent and 2.4 percent for both Mounjaro 10 mg and Mounjaro 15 mg.\n\nStrategic market play amid unmet needs\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s launch outpaces Danish rival Novo Nordisk, whose obesity drug Wegovy (semaglutide) remains unavailable in India despite its popularity abroad.\n\nNovo\u2019s diabetes drug Ozempic, also containing semaglutide, is sold in India but faces supply constraints. Analysts suggest that Lilly\u2019s pricing and local partnerships could disrupt the market.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make innovative treatments accessible while collaborating with India\u2019s healthcare ecosystem,\u201d said Tucker emphasising efforts to boost disease awareness and improve healthcare infrastructure.\n\nWhile Mounjaro\u2019s entry is timely, affordability remains a hurdle for many Indians. At \u20b914,000 per month, the starting dose exceeds the average urban household\u2019s healthcare expenditure.\n\nEndocrinologists welcome the drug but stress the need for lifestyle interventions. Medications like Mounjaro are tools, not magic bullets. They must complement dietary changes and physical activity.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s metabolic health crisis is projected to worsen, with diabetes cases expected to reach 134 million by 2045. Obesity, linked to 80 percent of type 2 diabetes cases, exacerbates the burden on an already strained healthcare system. Lilly\u2019s move not only taps into a lucrative market but aligns with national health priorities, offering a model for global pharmaceutical firms to balance profit with public health imperatives.\n\nAs Mounjaro reaches Indian pharmacies, the focus now shifts to patient access and outcomes. For millions struggling with obesity and diabetes, this launch could mark a turning point \u2014 provided the promise of innovation translates into real-world results.\n\n(Edited by Muhammed Fazil.)",

But is Mounjaro a better option than Ozempic? read more\n\nAs new drugs to treat diabetes and prompt weight loss gain popularity worldwide, US-based pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has launched its \u2018game-changing\u2019 medication in India. Mounjaro, a diabetes and weight-loss drug, has made its debut in the Indian market as the country grapples with high obesity and diabetes rates.\n\nDrugs like Mounjaro, Wegovy and Ozempic have taken the world by storm. These are injectable medications that control blood sugar to treat type 2 diabetes and help in weight loss in obese people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before Mounjaro\u2019s entry into India, Danish company Novo Nordisk-manufactured Ozempic has been creating waves. We take a look at how they compare and which is better.\n\nWeight-loss drugs are all the rage\n\nNew drugs to treat type 2 diabetes have become popular quickly due to their weight-loss benefits. This class of drugs is called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists that mimic the effect of two hormones naturally produced by the body \u2014 glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1.\n\nThe human gut secretes GLP-1 and GIP hormones after food consumption to regulate blood sugar levels. GLP-1 makes people feel fuller, decreases their food cravings, and helps them lose weight.\n\nThese hormones affect the insulin and glucagon levels in the body. Drugs such as Mounjaro and Ozempic help regulate blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking these naturally occurring hormones.\n\nMounjaro in India\n\nMounjaro, chemically known as tirzepatide, was launched by Eli Lilly in India on Thursday (March 20). The injection is to be administered once a week under the fatty tissue of the skin.\n\nIt is recommended by healthcare providers to patients along with customised diet and exercise plans.\n\nA pharmacist displays a box of Mounjaro, a tirzepatide injection drug used for treating type 2 diabetes made by Lilly at Rock Canyon Pharmacy in Provo, Utah, US March 29, 2023. File Photo/Reuters\n\nAs per a Reuters report, the diabetes drug is priced at Rs 3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and Rs 4,375 for a 5 mg vial, its lowest doses. A patient will have to spend up to Rs 17,500 every month, depending on the doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\n\u201cThis India-specific pricing reflects Lilly\u2019s commitment to expanding access to innovative treatments in the country,\u201d Eli Lilly said in a statement.\n\nTirzepatide is sold as Zepbound for obesity in the United States. It is also available in the United Kingdom and Europe under the brand name Mounjaro for both diabetes and weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMounjaro vs Ozempic\n\nMounjaro (tirzepatide) is the first drug in its class to activate both GLP-1 and GIP hormones that regulate blood sugar.\n\n\u201cUnlike conventional diabetes treatments, Mounjaro activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors\u2014offering improved glucose regulation and enhanced metabolic effects,\u201d Dr Jagadish Hiremath, public health expert, told moneycontrol.com.\n\nThis makes Mounjaro stand apart from drugs like Ozempic, chemically known as semaglutide, which only activate the body\u2019s GLP-1 receptors.\n\nBoth Mounjaro and Ozempic come with side effects of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.\n\n\u201cLike Ozempic, Mounjaro has gained traction through TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube as a weight loss breakthrough. Reports suggest that public figures are using it for fast, effortless weight loss. Many doctors are prescribing Mounjaro off-label for patients without diabetes,\u201d Dr Hiremath said.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIt is hard to say. Both Mounjaro and Ozempic have their own benefits.\n\nAs Mounjaro mimics the effects of both GIP and GLP-1, it controls blood sugar better than its predecessors like Ozempic. It is also a better option for weight loss. According to Scientific American, clinical trials show that the drug can help people lose 20 per cent or more of their body mass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOzempic can lead to a weight reduction of nearly 15 per cent, a 68-week clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed.\n\nAs per Health.com, doctors usually prefer Ozempic for patients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke.\n\nSemaglutide is the first GLP-1 receptor agonist to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes among non-diabetics, \u201cso that\u2019s a game changer in the landscape of obesity medicine,\u201d Sue Pedersen, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Canada told Scientific American in 2024.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

The launch of Mounjaro demonstrates our ongoing support to this mission and our shared vision of a healthier nation.\u201d\n\nA Broader Debate on Health Solutions\n\nThe launch of Mounjaro has sparked a larger discussion on India\u2019s approach to managing lifestyle-related diseases. While some view the drug as a necessary tool in fighting obesity and diabetes, others believe that more focus should be placed on natural and preventive measures, such as lifestyle changes, healthier diets, and exercise.\n\nAs the debate continues, the Indian public and health authorities must weigh the benefits of medical interventions against the need for long-term, sustainable health solutions.",

            "content": "The new class of weight-loss medicines that has taken the world by a storm will now become available in India, with the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly on Thursday announcing the launch of tirzepatide to be marketed as Mounjaro. The medicine will be available in a single-dose vial, meant to be taken as a shot under the skin every week.\n\nThe 2.5 mg vial is priced at Rs 3,500 (MRP) and the 5 mg vial is priced at Rs 4,375(MRP). This India-specific pricing is part of El Lilly\u2019s effort to expand access.\n\nThe drug \u2014 along with Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide marketed as Wegovy \u2014 has been much anticipated in India after its significant weight-loss effect was witnessed by many around the world. \u201cOur mission of making life better for people living with obesity and diabetes in India is reflected in our efforts to accelerate the introduction of innovative medicines. The launch of Mounjaro demonstrates our ongoing support to this mission and our shared vision of a healthier nation,\u201d said Winselow Tucker, president and general manager of Lilly India, in a release.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nWhat is tirzepatide?\n\nTirzepatide belongs to a new class of diabetes medicines that were approved for the treatment of chronic obesity after they were found to be almost as effective as bariatric surgery for weight-loss. Called incretin mimetics, these drugs mimic the action of certain gut hormones to improve secretion of insulin, inhibit secretion of glucagon that stimulates glucose production in the liver, and also reduce appetite by slowing down digestion.\n\nTirzepatide acts on two targets \u2014 GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone receptor and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide).\n\nThe medicine can help people lose just over 20% of their body weight on average, with nearly one in three persons dropping a quarter of their body weight. The drug is not a magic bullet, however. It has to be taken along-side a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.\n\nWho is the drug meant for?\n\nThe drug is meant to be prescribed to those who are obese with a BMI (body mass index) of over 30 or those who are overweight with a BMI between 25 and 29 with other weight-related co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and heart disease among others.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe drug should not be prescribed to people who have a family history of a particular type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or a rare condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). It should be avoided in people who may have an allergic reaction to the medicine or its components.\n\nWith this class of medicines linked to side effects such as stomach paralysis, doctors also suggest avoiding the medication in patients with long-standing diabetes and sluggish peristalsis (contraction and relaxation of the digestive tract to push the food through) and gastric obstructions. They say it should also be avoided in patients prone to nausea as the medicine is known to lead to nausea and vomiting during the initial period.\n\nWhat is the evidence available so far?\n\nSeveral global clinical trials, which included participants from India, have been carried out to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicine.\n\nSURMOUNT-1 \u2014 a study of 2,539 adults with obesity, or overweight with weight-related medical problems \u2014 found that the participants on 5 mg weekly dose lost on average 15% of their body weight in 72 weeks, those on 10 mg dose lost 19.5%, and those on the highest 15 mg dose lost 20.9%. To compare, those who were given a placebo lost only 3.1% of their body weight. The study found that nearly one in three persons put on the higher doses of the medicine lost nearly 25% of their body weight. To compare, only 1.5% of the people on placebo lost as much weight.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother SURMOUNT-5 trial with 18,386 participants found tirzepatide to be more effective than its competitor semaglutide for weight loss. The study showed that participants on tirzepatide lost 20.2% of their body weight at 72 weeks as compared to 13.7% with semaglutide.\n\nImportantly, SURMOUNT-4 trial with 670 participants showed that people regained the lost weight when they stopped taking the medicine. After taking the treatment for 36 weeks, those who stopped the once-a-week infusion gained back 14% of their body weight at 88 weeks. And, those who continued the treatment lost another 5.5% weight. The participants had lost around 20.9% of their total body weight during the 36 week treatment.\n\nWhat did the regulator say?\n\nThe subject expert committee on endocrinology and metabolism, under the apex drug regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), recommended that permission be granted to Eli Lilly for importing and marketing the medicine in a single dose pre-filled pen and in a single-dose vial in June last year. The company was also given permission to import and market multi-dose pen by December.\n\nThe expert committee recommended a phase IV trial \u2014 or post-marketing surveillance \u2014 be carried out by the company, which helps in understanding long term safety of the drug, its effects on a diverse population, and rare side-effects, if any.",

The new drug, however, will face competition soon enough, with other foreign pharmaceutical companies planning to introduce similar products in a growing market.\n\nMounjaro's 2.5mg and 5mg vials will be priced at \u20b93,500 and \u20b94,375 respectively, in India. The injectable drug, used to treat obesity and type-2 diabetes, is to be taken once a week. The company had previously stated that it would price the drug, which costs around $1,000 per month ( \u20b986,315) in the US, competitively in India. \u201cThis India-specific pricing reflects Lilly\u2019s commitment to expanding access to innovative treatments in the country,\u201d the company said on Thursday.\n\nWeight loss drugs such as Mounjaro help the body manage blood sugar more effectively, make one feel less hungry, and slow digestion, so the person feels full longer. Mounjaro, chemically known as tirzepatide, works by activating GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) hormone receptors.\n\nHight demand Demand for GLP-1 drugs that help reduce weight has boomed. According to Goldman Sachs, the market for GLP-1 drugs is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhile Mounjaro gives Lilly a first-mover advantage in India, it won't last long, as rival semaglutide (brand name Ozempic), goes off-patent in the country in 2026. Top generics makers such as Cipla, Dr Reddy\u2019s, Lupin, Natco Pharma, Mankind Pharma, and Biocon are all gearing up to launch cheaper generic copies of Ozempic. Meanwhile, India\u2019s largest pharma company, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is working on its own GLP-1 drug.\n\n\u201cSemaglutide generics will be priced almost 95% lower than [Eli Lilly'] current price,\u201d said Vishal Manchanda, senior vice-president, institutional research at Systematix Group. With the drop in prices, volumes of GLP-1 drugs would boom.\n\nOzempic innovator Novo Nordisk has also announced plans to launch the drug in India. However, it has not specified a timeline.\n\n\u201cAt least 50% of our [type 2 diabetes] patients are overweight,\u201d said Dr. Rajiv Kovil, a senior diabetologist.\n\nMounjaro is authorized for use in patients with and without type-2 diabetes for weight loss. Kovil expects the usage in patients with diabetes to be larger than those without, given the lack of awareness. \u201cWe could expect a 15-20% pickup in our patients with type-2 diabetes,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), there are 101 million people with diabetes in India. Of these, atleast 40 million are on medication. Manchanda of Systematix said that if even 0.5% of them use Mounjaro, it would fetch sales of $1.5 billion for Eli Lilly every year, since the annual cost works out to \u20b96.5 lakh per patient.\n\nThe number of people with obesity in the country is growing. As of 2021, about 180 million Indians were obese or overweight \u2013 this could grow to 450 million by 2050, according to a recent Lancet study. According to a July 2024 report in the British Medical Journal, the market for GLP-1 drugs for patients with diabetes in India doubled to $3.6 billion in 2024. This was also driven by unauthorized use of drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro through the grey market.\n\nThe diabetes drug market in India was estimated at \u20b917,000 crore in 2024, according to Pharmarack.\n\nEli Lilly has not yet announced plans for domestic partnerships to market the drug, whose global revenue surged 60% on-year to $3.53 billion in the December quarter. The single-dose vial drug was launched following market authorization from the country's drug regulator, the pharmaceutical major said.\n\nAlso read | Why cancer patients can hope for affordable drugs in India",

Both the companies have seen skyrocketing global demand for their innovative weight-loss drugs.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro is a once-weekly injection approved by India\u2019s drug regulator, is priced at 4,375 rupees ($50.67) for a 5 mg vial and 3,500 rupees ($40.54) for a 2.5 mg vial, its lowest doses. Subject to doctor\u2019s prescription, a patient may have to spend about $200 a month when taking a weekly dose of 5 mg, Reuters reported.\n\nChemically known as tirzepatide, Mounjaro is currently sold in the UK and Europe under the same brand name for both diabetes and weight loss. It is sold as Zepbound for obesity in the United States.\n\nIndia has about 101 million people living with diabetes and nearly half of these in the adult patients category are being inadequately treated with suboptimal glycemic control. Obesity, a chronic relapsing disease, is a major risk factor for diabetes, is linked to over 200 health complications, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. As of 2023, adult obesity prevalence in India stood at around 6.5%, affecting nearly 100 million people.\n\nALSO READ Eli Lilly launches its blockbuster weight loss drug Mounjaro in India\n\nDr. Ambrish Mithal, Chairman & Head \u2013 Endocrinology & Diabetes, Max Healthcare told Financial Express.com that obesity rates in India are rising at an alarming pace, fueling an increase in diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and related conditions. \u201cManaging obesity has become a significant challenge, and the ultimate solution lies in prevention. It is important to focus on promoting healthy eating habits from infancy through adulthood,\u201d he explained.\n\nHistorically, anti-obesity drugs have been plagued by failures, often proving ineffective or unsustainable. However, a new class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists has shown remarkable promise, Dr. Mithal revealed.\n\n\u201cOriginally developed for diabetes management, these drugs were later found to have profound weight-loss effects. Among them, semaglutide (sold as Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro) have gained significant attention. I think they are a huge advancement, and it\u2019s very good that they will now be accessible to the Indian public at a slightly more affordable price. Previously, patients had to obtain them from abroad, where they were very expensive. A large proportion of the urban middle class will now have access to this medication, which makes me optimistic,\u201d he told Financial Express.com.\n\nHe also raised his concerned regarding the risk of misuse.\n\n\u201c\u2026my only concern\u2014and I have voiced this repeatedly\u2014is the potential for misuse. Those considering these drugs should only take them under the supervision of an endocrinologist or physician. Do not make the mistake of using them as a cosmetic drug or casually purchasing and injecting them. Remember, these drugs will be available only by prescription,\u201d Dr. Mithal warned.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Ashutosh Goyal, Senior Consultant- Endocrinologist, Paras Health Gurgram told Financial Express.com that it\u2019s crucial that these therapies are integrated into holistic treatment plans that include lifestyle modifications, dietary guidance, and regular exercise.\n\n\u201cAs diagnostic experts, we emphasize the importance of thorough patient evaluation, accurate diagnostics, and ongoing monitoring to ensure the safe and effective use of these medications. By combining cutting-edge pharmaceuticals with personalized care, we can strive to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the long-term health and economic impact of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Further research and awareness initiatives are essential to optimize the utilization of these drugs and promote overall health and well-being,\u201d Dr. Goyal said.\n\nALSO READ Strides Pharma approves demerger from Arco Labs\n\nAccording to the company, in a glucose-dependent manner, Mounjaro improves first phase and second phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels; it also improves insulin sensitivity and delays gastric emptying.\n\n\u201cGIP receptors and GLP-1 receptors are both expressed in important areas of the brain that regulate appetite. Mounjaro reduces food intake, body weight, and decreases fat mass by regulating appetite; moreover, Mounjaro\u00ae has been demonstrated to regulate lipid utilization. Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has already had a tremendous impact on millions of people living with type 2 diabetes and obesity, respectively,\u201d the company stated.",

The pricing is significantly lower than in the United States, where the drug carries a list price of over $1,000 per fill. Analysts note that while Lilly gains a first-mover advantage over Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, the cost remains high for the Indian market. A patient on the highest dose would need to spend nearly 700,000 rupees ($8,100) annually, limiting accessibility for many consumers.\n\nNovo Nordisk has already secured approval for Wegovy in India but has not yet set a launch date. Originally, the company planned for a 2026 release, but its India team is pushing for an earlier debut in 2025. The delay gives Lilly a competitive edge, at least in the short term, as demand for weight-loss treatments continues to rise.\n\nIndia faces a growing public health challenge with obesity and diabetes rates steadily climbing. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of adults with diabetes in the country is expected to rise from 74.2 million in 2021 to over 124 million by 2045. A government survey found that nearly a quarter of Indian men and women between ages 15 and 49 are now overweight or obese, a notable increase from previous years.\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dominate the global GLP-1 receptor agonist market, which includes drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro, competition is emerging from Indian pharmaceutical firms such as Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's, and Lupin. These companies are working on developing generic versions to capture a share of what is projected to be a $150 billion global market within the next decade.\n\nLLY Price Action: Eli Lilly shares are up 0.96% at $845.12 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage Via Shutterstock.",

With Eli Lilly launching Mounjaro ahead of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, weight-loss drugs are heating up the market.Meanwhile, PM Modi also waved the red flag on India\u2019s rising obesity crisis quoting a Lancet study, saying 44 crore people in India could be obese by 2050! He also cautioned that every third person may suffer from serious illnesses due to obesity.In 2019, the financial burden of overweight and obesity in India was estimated at $28.95 billion, accounting for 1 percent of GDP, according to data from the Global Obesity Observatory. The economic burden is projected to hit a staggering $838.6 billion by 2060, eating up 2.5% of India's GDP.At the same time, India\u2019s weight-loss drug market is booming, growing at over 30% CAGR over the past five years to nearly Rs 600 crore. With over 100 million obese adults and 101 million diabetics, global pharmaceutical giants see India as the next big battleground for weight-loss treatments. So, is India ready for the weight-loss drug wave?In a significant move, U.S.-based Eli Lilly has launched Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in India, becoming the first major player to introduce a GLP-1 weight-loss drug in the country.Mounjaro, a once-weekly injection approved by India's drug regulator, is priced at Rs 4,375 for a 5 mg vial and Rs 3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial, its lowest doses, the company told. Its highest dose is 15 mg.A 2 mg weekly dose could cost a patient around Rs 14,000 and a 5 mg weekly dose could cost around Rs 17,500 per month respectively, making it a premium product in India. It should be noted that it is a prescription based medication.This puts Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker behind Wegovy and Ozempic, under pressure.Reportedly, Novo had initially planned to launch Wegovy in India by 2026, but its India team is now pushing for an early 2025 launch. As per Reuters, the company has already secured approval for Wegovy in India but has yet to announce an official launch date.While Mounjaro costs $1,086 per month in the U.S., its Indian pricing is significantly lower. However, some analysts believe it\u2019s still too expensive for most Indian consumers.Meanwhile, India\u2019s local pharma giants\u2014Sun Pharma, Cipla , Dr. Reddy\u2019s, and Lupin are racing to develop generic versions of these blockbuster drugs. Wegovy\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, is expected to go off-patent in India by 2026, opening the floodgates for affordable alternatives.With obesity and type 2 diabetes rates skyrocketing, India is at a tipping point. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of Indian adults with diabetes is expected to surge from 74.2 million in 2021 to over 124 million by 2045.Government data shows that 24% of women and 23% of men aged 15-49 were overweight or obese between 2019-2021, a sharp rise from the previous decade. The Economic Survey 2023-24 has already flagged obesity as a key health challenge, warning that India\u2019s demographic dividend could be at risk if fitness levels don\u2019t improve.The problem is more severe in cities, where obesity rates are far higher than in rural areas. Among men, 29.8% in urban areas are overweight or obese, compared to 19.3% in villages. For women, the urban rate stands at 33.2%, while in rural areas, it is 19.7%. Sedentary lifestyles and rising consumption of processed foods in cities are worsening the crisis.If obesity levels keep rising, India\u2019s long-term economic ambitions could be at risk. A key driver of the country\u2019s growth is its demographic dividend\u2014the economic advantage of having a large working-age population. However, a workforce in poor health could lead to lower productivity and higher healthcare costs, weakening India\u2019s competitive edge. Many developed countries, such as Japan and parts of Europe, are already struggling with ageing populations. If obesity undermines India\u2019s workforce, the country may find it harder to establish itself as a global economic powerhouse.With a $150 billion global market up for grabs, India is set to become a key battleground for weight-loss drugs. Lilly\u2019s first-mover advantage gives it a head start, but Novo Nordisk\u2019s aggressive push and upcoming local generics could shake up the market.As weight-loss drugs become more accessible, the real challenge remains - Can India curb its obesity crisis before it spirals into an economic disaster?",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -0.21%) has been around for almost 150 years, finding ways to innovate and grow. Today, it's the most valuable healthcare company in the world, with a market cap of $730 billion.\n\nThe next largest healthcare company is UnitedHealth Group, which is worth less than $450 billion. Over the past five years, Eli Lilly's stock has soared by around 530%, soundly beating the S&P 500 and its 136% gain during the same time frame.\n\nEven with such impressive gains in recent years, there is no shortage of reasons to feel comfortable buying and holding the stock for the long haul. Here are five of the best reasons to buy shares of Eli Lilly today and why it's not too late to add it to your portfolio.\n\n1. Eli Lilly has a robust pipeline of drugs with plenty of growth opportunities\n\nWhat's made Eli Lilly a hot buy in recent years is its GLP-1-related efforts. The company has a couple of GLP-1-approved drugs in Zepbound (weight loss) and Mounjaro (diabetes), and the billions in revenue these drugs may generate in the years ahead has investors bullish on the company's future growth.\n\nHowever, there's also hope that Alzheimer's drug Kisunla, which regulators approved last year, may also become a blockbuster for the business. And the company is still eyeing more growth opportunities.\n\nLast year, it reached an agreement with Aktis Oncology to develop radiopharmaceuticals, which are more targeted cancer treatments. It's a relatively new type of therapy option for patients, treating specific cancer cells, and just one example of the company's plentiful, robust pipeline.\n\nEli Lilly has dozens of ongoing clinical trials. With the company's strong commitment to innovation, there may be many more blockbuster drugs in its future.\n\n2. Eli Lilly is investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing to help meet demand\n\nThere's no denying that GLP-1 drugs are a big part of Eli Lilly's business today and will be for years to come. The biggest problem these days is to ensure that there's adequate supply. To combat this, the company has been investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nLast month, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new manufacturing locations, and that's in addition to other investments. Over the past five years, it has announced over $50 billion in manufacturing investments, which CEO David Ricks says is \"the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history.\"\n\nBy growing its operations to bolster its supply of drugs, Lilly is reducing the risk that it may miss out on lost sales due to massive demand. It's a good problem to have and an important one to address, and a big reason the company can do so is because of its impressive financials.\n\n3. Eli Lilly's financials are strong, giving it the resources to grow operations\n\nFor Eli Lilly to be a top growth stock, having the potential to grow isn't enough. It also needs the resources to take advantage of those opportunities and invest in its operations -- and it has that, as well.\n\nLast year, the company's revenue rose by 32% to more than $45 billion. More importantly, its net income doubled to $10.6 billion, and it generated $8.8 billion in cash flow from its day-to-day operations. Although free cash flow was just $414 million, it came amid some heavy capital spending. In two of the past four years, Eli Lilly's annual free cash flow has been in excess of $4 billion.\n\nWith strong financials to help grow its operations, Eli Lilly is in excellent shape to continue reinvesting into its pipeline and future opportunities.\n\n4. Eli Lilly's dividend grows at a high rate, which should continue as earnings rise\n\nAn excellent reason to buy and hold shares of Eli Lilly is for its growing dividend. At 0.7%, the stock's yield may look unimpressive, but if not for the healthcare company's rapidly growing valuation, that yield would be much higher. The company has aggressively boosted its payout, and in December, it announced a 15% increase to the dividend -- the seventh year in a row that it has made such a significant boost to its payout.\n\nFor long-term investors, a growing dividend can be valuable, especially one that's rising at such a high rate to ensure that recurring income rises at a faster rate than inflation. Plus, it may attract more income-seeking investors in the process, pushing the stock price higher. Even if the rate of increases slows down in the future, there could be many more rate hikes ahead.\n\n5. Its valuation looks attractive, specifically its modest PEG ratio\n\nEli Lilly stock trades at close to 70 times its trailing earnings, which may dissuade many investors from buying it. They may fear that they've missed out and a sell-off may be overdue.\n\nBut based on a price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG) of just 1.2, Eli Lilly remains a solid buy, given the growth that analysts expect from the business going forward. When a PEG ratio is around 1, the stock isn't expensive when factoring in its long-term growth. Ideally, the PEG would be less than 1, but the modest multiple makes a good case nonetheless that Eli Lilly stock isn't as expensive as it may appear to be at first glance.\n\nEli Lilly is a no-brainer buy for the long haul\n\nBy now, it should be fairly evident why Eli Lilly is a tremendous growth stock to buy and hold for years. It has a lot of potential to continue to go higher, even though its valuation may seem rich. The company has proven to be a growth machine over the years and can be an excellent investment to put in your portfolio to buy and forget about.",

This expansion comes as the World Obesity Federation forecasts that the obesity rate among Indian adults will rise to 11% by 2035, creating a significant demand for health solutions.\n\nIn response to this growing need, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focusing on India. Novo Nordisk has announced plans to introduce its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy, to the Indian market by 2026. It is noteworthy that the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, will expire in India in 2026.\n\nBoth Mounjaro and Wegovy belong to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class of drugs, which mimic gut hormones to regulate blood sugar and delay gastric emptying, thereby enhancing satiety. These medications have gained rapid popularity worldwide, leading to supply shortages.",

Things are different now that they're both taking an obesity drug.\n\n\"We recently ordered a pizza and we ate some of it the first night and then the next day we had maybe a little bit more,\" says Christina. \"And then we ended up throwing the pizza away because it had gone past the days that you could eat it. And it was so strange because we have never done that.\"\n\n\"No, never,\" her husband, Jackson, says.\n\nThey've each lost about 20 pounds in six weeks. But the Agars, who live in Minnesota, aren't taking Eli Lilly's Zepbound; their insurance doesn't cover it.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThey're taking a cheaper alternative that contains the active ingredient, called tirzepatide.\n\nIt's made by a compounding pharmacy, which is a special kind of pharmacy that's allowed to essentially make copies of drugs during shortages.\n\nSince starting on the compounded tirzepatide, Christina says, she has more energy for their four kids. And Jackson doesn't need his sleep apnea machine anymore. (In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved Zepbound to treat sleep apnea.)\n\n\"It is completely life-changing to take a bite of these triggering foods and just be like, enjoy it, say, 'Yup, that was good and now I'm full,'\" he says.\n\nBut the compounded drugs that the Agars and others have come to rely on aren't here to stay.\n\nThe FDA says compounding pharmacies have to stop making tirzepatide because the agency has declared the yearlong Zepbound shortage over. The deadline is Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHow patients are feeling\n\nThe Agars are worried. Other patients are sad. Some are just angry.\n\nIn Arizona, Margot Carmichael was in denial.\n\n\"I thought what I think a lot of people perhaps did: Oh, it'll be fine. These compounding and telehealth places are making millions off of this and helping so many people. There's no way this is going to stop being available,\" she says.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIt has been confusing for patients. Some telehealth companies have been telling them that they won't be affected. Others have been offering last-minute sales as the FDA deadline nears.\n\n\"So March 19, we are essentially done,\" says Josh Fritzler, the chief financial officer for Olympia Pharmaceuticals, which has a large compounding pharmacy in Orlando, Fla., called an outsourcing facility. Production will stop, but pharmacies can still dispense Olympia's tirzepatide until it runs out or expires.\n\nOlympia has made the medicine for more than 100,000 patients a month, Fritzler says.\n\n\"They're nervous. They're scared,\" he says. \"And we're just hopeful that we can make enough in the time being to fill patients' scripts.\"\n\nSeven large facilities, including Olympia's, are making tirzepatide, according to the FDA's latest Outsourcing Facility Product Report. They are required to follow the same safety and quality standards as brand and generic drugmakers and are inspected by the FDA. Smaller compounding pharmacies, which are regulated by states, were supposed to stop in February.\n\n\n\nConsumers get creative\n\nMany patients told NPR they have been stocking up on compounded tirzepatide.\n\nCarmichael doesn't have health insurance right now. She says she can afford only a small stockpile.\n\n\"I don't have the money,\" she says. \"So I'm going to borrow the money and try to get three more months and stretch it out as long as I can and hope that six to nine months from now, there'll be another solution.\"\n\nEli Lilly sells Zepbound vials at a discount for people not using insurance, but Carmichael says they're still too expensive. She would have to pay $500 or $600 for a month's supply of her dose from Eli Lilly.\n\nFor around the same price, she has been able to get three months' worth from a compounding pharmacy. The standard forms of Zepbound, which come in an auto-injector pen, can cost more than $1,000 per month without insurance.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCarmichael and other patients NPR spoke with say they buy large vials and then stretch the medicine out over an extended period of time (until the vials expire) to save money.\n\nBut the Eli Lilly vials don't contain a preservative and are labeled for single-use, which the patients say complicates their cost-saving strategy. Also, to keep the company's discount, patients like Carmichael would have to renew their orders every 45 days. \"They're making it as difficult as possible for people,\" she says.\n\nThe drugmaker didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a February interview with NPR, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said offering a discount for patients taking the higher doses who reorder every 45 days is an \"opportunity for us to reward people who go with the program and stay on the medication.\"\n\nSome people are talking online about buying the active ingredient from China and mixing the obesity drugs in their homes. They call it the \"gray market.\"\n\nZepbound and the compounded alternatives have to be sterile for injection, so a homemade version would be challenging to make safely.\n\nJackson Agar, in Minnesota, says the gray market is a risk his family is just unwilling to take. \"Look, when you ban stuff, people are going to turn to crazy alternatives because we need this and we don't have that much money.\"",

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-03-19, Eli Lilly and Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $271.69. It's currently trading at a price of $813.48. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -199.41%. The company is significantly overvalued.\n\nUnlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Eli Lilly and Co\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Eli Lilly and Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $13 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.3%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 14.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 150.98 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 120.71 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 271.69\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $5.31. This valuation indicates that the Eli Lilly and Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -15219.77%.

In addition, the company announced the advancement of two lead programs and a second discovery partnership in obesity.\n\nAmpersand\u2019s Series B funding will fuel the continued development of its computationally powered Address, Navigate, Determine (AND)\u2122 Platform to program AND-Body\u2122 Therapeutics, a new category of smarter biologic medicines. AND-Body Therapeutics are designed to localize to their intended target and conditionally actuate biology to treat disease, enabling improved target engagement while limiting on-target, off-tissue side effects. The versatility of the AND Platform allows Ampersand to take aim at a broad range of diseases simultaneously. The funding will also drive the acceleration of Ampersand\u2019s initial pipeline of impactful programs, including one in immuno-inflammation and another in immuno-oncology, both of which are planned to enter IND-enabling studies in 2025.\n\n\u201cOur fundraise represents a pivotal milestone in Ampersand\u2019s journey and affirms our vision to reimagine what\u2019s possible with programmed biologics,\u201d said Jason Gardner, D.Phil., CEO and Director of Ampersand Biomedicines and CEO-Partner at Flagship Pioneering. \u201cWe have made important strides accelerating our pipeline progress, securing two partnerships that extend the AND Platform\u2019s reach into obesity, and expanding our team of highly skilled leaders, scientists, and board members. We look forward to advancing our initial programs in immuno-inflammation and immuno-oncology into IND-enabling studies this year.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the past year, Ampersand has also achieved other key milestones, including a partnership with Pioneering Medicines, Flagship\u2019s in house drug discovery and development unit for a discovery program, focused on the treatment of obesity. In November, Ampersand partnered with Pfizer and Pioneering Medicines to create next-generation programmable medicines targeting tissue-selective metabolic pathways, offering a potent approach to potentially improve metabolic health. Last month, the company also added industry veteran Elizabeth Mily to its Board of Directors.\n\n\u201cAt Ampersand, we\u2019ve unlocked a fundamentally novel way to program biologics and in doing so, are ushering in a new era of smarter medicines,\u201d said Avak Kahvejian, Ph.D., Board Chair and Co-Founder of Ampersand Biomedicines and General Partner at Flagship Pioneering. \u201cWe have reached a key inflection point in the development of our AND Platform, and now with the advancement of an initial pipeline of wholly owned and partnered programs, the enormous impact that such a powerful platform enables is materializing. Looking ahead, with molecular addresses for so many more tissue and cell targets, there is still tremendous opportunity to add new programs and partnerships as we seek to unleash the full potential of this new category of biologics.\u201d\n\nAbout Ampersand Biomedicines\n\nAmpersand Biomedicines enables a new way of programming medicines that work precisely where needed in the body and nowhere else. The company\u2019s computationally powered Address, Navigate, Determine (AND)\u2122 Platform identifies ideal addresses for drug localization and informs the design of AND-Body\u2122 Therapeutics that have the optimal therapeutic effect.

The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) alleged the agency was \u201cabruptly depriving patients of much needed treatment and artificially raising drug prices.\u201d\n\nCompounders had been allowed to produce and sell hundreds of thousands of their own versions of popular anti-obesity drugs, so long as the FDA considered them in shortage.\n\nCompounded drugs are sold at vastly lower prices than the branded versions, but drug companies and some obesity specialists have expressed concerns that some compounded products aren\u2019t FDA-approved.\n\nAfter the suit was filed, the FDA temporarily paused to reconsider the declaration to end the shortage but ultimately reaffirmed its decision in December. The agency said it would not take any enforcement action against compounders before the court ruled.\n\nThe agency at the time gave drug compounders a transition period to avoid patient care disruption. Smaller, state-licensed pharmacies had until Feb. 18 and now must immediately stop producing their own copies of the drugs.\n\nLarger outsourcing facilities, which are FDA-regulated and can create prescription-specific compounded drugs as well as bulk orders, must cease compounding, distributing or dispensing tirzepatide injections by March 19.\n\nThe OFA\u2019s lawsuit said the FDA made its decision to remove tirzepatide from the shortage list based only on statements from the manufacturer, \u201cwithout notice, without soliciting input from affected parties and the public, and without meaningful rationale.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Hill on Thursday, OFA Chair Lee Rosebush said the group \u201cis considering all of its options regarding the judgment, including an appeal.\u201d\n\nRosebush said he couldn\u2019t comment on specifics of the decision until the court unseals it.\n\nEli Lilly in a statement said the decision \u201cmarks the end of the road for mass compounding of risky, unapproved knockoffs that threaten the health and safety of Americans.\u201d\n\nAny company that continues mass compounding tirzepatide \u201cis breaking the law, and we will work with regulators and law enforcement to stop it,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\n\nA similar OFA lawsuit against the FDA for removing from the shortage list semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is pending.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has been around for almost 150 years, finding ways to innovate and grow. Today, it's the most valuable healthcare company in the world, with a market cap of $730 billion.\n\nThe next largest healthcare company is UnitedHealth Group, which is worth less than $450 billion. Over the past five years, Eli Lilly's stock has soared by around 530%, soundly beating the S&P 500 and its 136% gain during the same time frame.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nEven with such impressive gains in recent years, there is no shortage of reasons to feel comfortable buying and holding the stock for the long haul. Here are five of the best reasons to buy shares of Eli Lilly today and why it's not too late to add it to your portfolio.\n\n1. Eli Lilly has a robust pipeline of drugs with plenty of growth opportunities\n\nWhat's made Eli Lilly a hot buy in recent years is its GLP-1-related efforts. The company has a couple of GLP-1-approved drugs in Zepbound (weight loss) and Mounjaro (diabetes), and the billions in revenue these drugs may generate in the years ahead has investors bullish on the company's future growth.\n\nHowever, there's also hope that Alzheimer's drug Kisunla, which regulators approved last year, may also become a blockbuster for the business. And the company is still eyeing more growth opportunities.\n\nLast year, it reached an agreement with Aktis Oncology to develop radiopharmaceuticals, which are more targeted cancer treatments. It's a relatively new type of therapy option for patients, treating specific cancer cells, and just one example of the company's plentiful, robust pipeline.\n\nEli Lilly has dozens of ongoing clinical trials. With the company's strong commitment to innovation, there may be many more blockbuster drugs in its future.\n\n2. Eli Lilly is investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing to help meet demand\n\nThere's no denying that GLP-1 drugs are a big part of Eli Lilly's business today and will be for years to come. The biggest problem these days is to ensure that there's adequate supply. To combat this, the company has been investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing.\n\nLast month, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new manufacturing locations, and that's in addition to other investments. Over the past five years, it has announced over $50 billion in manufacturing investments, which CEO David Ricks says is \"the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history.\"\n\nBy growing its operations to bolster its supply of drugs, Lilly is reducing the risk that it may miss out on lost sales due to massive demand. It's a good problem to have and an important one to address, and a big reason the company can do so is because of its impressive financials.\n\n3. Eli Lilly's financials are strong, giving it the resources to grow operations\n\nFor Eli Lilly to be a top growth stock, having the potential to grow isn't enough. It also needs the resources to take advantage of those opportunities and invest in its operations -- and it has that, as well.\n\nLast year, the company's revenue rose by 32% to more than $45 billion. More importantly, its net income doubled to $10.6 billion, and it generated $8.8 billion in cash flow from its day-to-day operations. Although free cash flow was just $414 million, it came amid some heavy capital spending. In two of the past four years, Eli Lilly's annual free cash flow has been in excess of $4 billion.\n\nWith strong financials to help grow its operations, Eli Lilly is in excellent shape to continue reinvesting into its pipeline and future opportunities.\n\n4. Eli Lilly's dividend grows at a high rate, which should continue as earnings rise\n\nAn excellent reason to buy and hold shares of Eli Lilly is for its growing dividend. At 0.7%, the stock's yield may look unimpressive, but if not for the healthcare company's rapidly growing valuation, that yield would be much higher. The company has aggressively boosted its payout, and in December, it announced a 15% increase to the dividend -- the seventh year in a row that it has made such a significant boost to its payout.\n\nFor long-term investors, a growing dividend can be valuable, especially one that's rising at such a high rate to ensure that recurring income rises at a faster rate than inflation. Plus, it may attract more income-seeking investors in the process, pushing the stock price higher. Even if the rate of increases slows down in the future, there could be many more rate hikes ahead.\n\n5. Its valuation looks attractive, specifically its modest PEG ratio\n\nEli Lilly stock trades at close to 70 times its trailing earnings, which may dissuade many investors from buying it. They may fear that they've missed out and a sell-off may be overdue.\n\nBut based on a price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG) of just 1.2, Eli Lilly remains a solid buy, given the growth that analysts expect from the business going forward. When a PEG ratio is around 1, the stock isn't expensive when factoring in its long-term growth. Ideally, the PEG would be less than 1, but the modest multiple makes a good case nonetheless that Eli Lilly stock isn't as expensive as it may appear to be at first glance.\n\nEli Lilly is a no-brainer buy for the long haul\n\nBy now, it should be fairly evident why Eli Lilly is a tremendous growth stock to buy and hold for years. It has a lot of potential to continue to go higher, even though its valuation may seem rich. The company has proven to be a growth machine over the years and can be an excellent investment to put in your portfolio to buy and forget about.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The start-up will use the funding to wrap up preclinical work on two new immunological drug candidates, one focused on inflammation and the other on cancer. The series B is Ampersand\u2019s first venture capital financing since it launched with $50 million from Flagship 2 years ago.\n\nCEO Jason Gardner declines to share specifics about the exact targets or compositions of those two lead compounds, or when they might advance into human trials. But he does say they\u2019re engineered as improved versions of existing drugs\u2014\u201cparent molecules,\u201d which could be anything from early-stage drug candidates to approved treatments\u2014with tweaks for better potency and tolerability.\n\n\u201cBasically, they came from drugs that we knew were active, but they had some challenges,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t work well enough at the right dose, so they had some off-target effects.\u201d\n\nGardner says Ampersand is agnostic about whether it develops a small molecule or a biologic. For the start-up, the only concrete goal is to get drugs to the right place in the body, which he calls \u201cone of the single biggest challenges in medicine today.\u201d To do that, Ampersand takes available data about existing compounds, including their delivery challenges, and uses it to design molecules in silico. The drug candidates that show promise on the computer are then made and tested in a lab.\n\n\u201cThe large amount of data we have that feeds the platform, through training datasets and machine learning, is very powerful,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the next chapter.\u201d\n\nAmpersand acquired a Czech firm called AbCheck for an undisclosed amount last year, inheriting the company\u2019s antibody discovery capabilities, which now help Ampersand find antibodies to target.",

While the broader market faced challenges, including a downturn in major indexes like the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Eli Lilly seemed to benefit from its strategic moves and robust product announcements, countering a general tech-sector decline.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nThe Growing Market and Innovation in Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Technology\n\nThe WHO estimates that 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, with the majority residing in low- or middle-income countries. On average, diabetes directly contributes to 1.5 million deaths annually. Over the past few decades, there has been a steady rise in both the prevalence and the number of cases of diabetes. Nonetheless, the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 500 million people worldwide presently have diabetes, and that figure is predicted to increase by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045.\n\nOne medical device used to assist manage diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is the continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The market has grown dramatically in recent years, and it is currently a rapidly expanding category of diabetes care equipment. The demand for advanced diabetes care goods, including insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) equipment, was estimated by GlobalData to be worth $21.8 billion in 2023. GlobalData projects that the market will reach $33.4 billion in revenue by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34%.\n\nThe GlobalData marketed products database shows that there are currently 97 products in the CGM category. Most of these devices are standard CGMs, with only a few being implanted sensors. 133 products are either approved or in the development stage, according to the GlobalData pipeline products database. The research indicates that this market niche is expanding quickly and is a hub for innovative new technologies like implantable CGMs.\n\nToday, CGM technology incorporates AI. For example, Roche introduced Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a cutting-edge CGM gadget driven by predictive AI. At the launch, Julien Boisdron, Chief Medical Officer for Roche Diabetes Care, called it \u201ca solution more than a CGM.\u201d He described how the system, which consists of two algorithms and a sensor, aids in data visualization and prediction.\n\nThe Rise of GLP-1 Drugs: Opportunities, Growth, and Challenges\n\nA new era of opportunity has arrived for the management of diabetes and its associated complications. These novel strategies can effectively treat the co-occurring conditions of obesity and diabetes. A class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists is used to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). By 2030, the GLP-1 market, which is equally driven by obesity and diabetes, is expected to grow to $100 billion. About 9% of Americans, or 30 million people, may be GLP-1 users by this point.\n\nTwelve percent of adult Americans report having taken a GLP-1 drug at some point, according to the most recent KFF Health Tracking poll. In the previous five years, 22% of patients with a diagnosis of obesity or overweight also took GLP-1, while 43% of patients with diabetes had the drug. Adults who have heard \u201ca little\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d about these medications have gone from 70% to 82% over the past year, while those who have heard \u201ca lot\u201d about them have increased from 19% to 32%.\n\nHowever, problems have arisen due to the increased demand for these diabetes and weight-loss medications. An \u201cexplosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online\u201d is a potential threat, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA). Semaglutides, which are sold under the brand name Ozempic, help persons with type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar. However, in other countries, like the US, where they are sold under the name Wegovy, they are also commonly used to help people lose weight. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated:\n\n\u201cPharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list, we selected diabetes-related stocks from the HRTS GLP-1, Obesity, and Cardiometabolic ETF, as well as the EDOC Telemedicine and Digital Health ETF. We then ranked these stocks based on the number of billionaire investors holding stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024, prioritizing those with the highest billionaire ownership.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 23\n\nDollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $13,742,938,229\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global leader in pharmaceuticals, specializing in diabetes care. Since introducing the world\u2019s first commercial insulin in 1923, the company has maintained its position at the forefront of diabetes treatment. The company\u2019s diabetes portfolio includes key products like Humalog (insulin lispro), Trulicity (dulaglutide), Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide). These treatments address both type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s Q4 2024 financial results reflect strong growth and innovation across the board. Their full-year revenue rose by 32%, with Q4 revenue jumping 45%, surpassing initial guidance by $4 billion. A major driver of this growth was the success of new products like Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, which together contributed over $3.1 billion in Q4 revenue. Mounjaro\u2019s global sales reached $3.5 billion, while Zepbound generated $1.9 billion in the U.S.\n\nThe company\u2019s profitability surged as well, with gross margins increasing to 83.2% and operating income more than doubling to $5.6 billion. EPS also saw a significant boost, rising to $5.32 from $2.49 in Q4 2023. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) experienced broad global growth, with notable increases in the U.S. (40%), Europe (82%), Japan (27%), and China (13%). Looking ahead, potential label expansions for Zepbound, including coverage for obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure, could further broaden the drug\u2019s market potential.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 2nd on our list of best diabetes stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly And Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that may be splitting soon.\n\nStock splits change the number of outstanding shares of a company, but not the company\u2019s overall value. A forward split makes each share cheaper and easier to buy. Splits can range from 2-for-1 to 100-for-1 or more. In a 2-for-1 split, one share becomes two by cutting the price in half. For instance, a $100 share becomes two $50 shares. This makes shares more affordable and attracts more investors. Even though the price per share drops, the total value held by shareholders stays the same. So, splits don\u2019t change who controls the company. The main reason for a split is to make the stock more appealing, or accessible for retail investors.\n\nUncertainty is Driving Selloff\n\nDan Suzuki, Deputy CIO at Bernstein Advisors, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 on March 14 to share his perspective on the recent persistent three-week downtrend in the indexes during an interview. He explained that the sell-off is largely driven by uncertainty and its negative impact on sentiment. According to Suzuki, analyzing market movements reveals that the stocks that rallied most after the election until mid-February have seen significant declines since then and create a mirror image effect. Additionally, the most expensive and high-beta stocks have been hit hardest as the market prices are in an uncertainty risk premium. These dynamics are central to what is driving markets currently. Despite this, Suzuki noted that hard economic data remains strong and suggests that relief from headline uncertainties could reduce the risk premium.\n\nSuzuki noted concerns over soft retail sales and spending figures, which might be due to weather or seasonal factors. However, he highlighted resilience in weekly retail sales and strong leading indicators. Prolonged uncertainty could still impact growth. Suzuki linked consumer trends to disappointing corporate guidance and persistently high inflation, which affected sentiment. He also pointed out the wealth effect caused by a stock market decline of 10% or more, particularly for investors in crowded names. Markets are adjusting to persistent uncertainty, which will continue even with relief anticipated within the next month or two, which will prevent a return to the high multiples seen in 2020-2023.\n\nIn an uncertain market with heightened risk premiums, companies considering stock splits may need to weigh the potential benefits against the backdrop of overall market sentiment. The ongoing economic uncertainty and changes in consumer behavior might impact how companies approach decisions about stock splits, especially if they are concerned about maintaining investor confidence in a volatile market.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.7% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Lilly belongs, has gained 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lilly is expected to post earnings of $4.60 per share, indicating a change of +78.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.47 points to a change of +80.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.33 indicates a change of +33.5% from what Lilly is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lilly is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

The recent statement from the FDA, which expressed concerns over compounded GLP-1s, is expected to have a favorable impact on Lilly\u2019s stock. The FDA highlighted issues such as safety, efficacy, and quality oversight, particularly in relation to Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide, which underscores the competitive advantage of Lilly\u2019s legally marketed products.\n\nFurthermore, the FDA\u2019s proactive stance in restricting the use of Lilly\u2019s retatrutide in compounding reinforces the company\u2019s market position. These developments support the belief that Lilly\u2019s revenue guidance for 2025, projected between $58 billion and $61 billion, is both conservative and attainable. Consequently, the Buy rating is reiterated with a target price of $1,190, anticipating a significant share price return of 46.3%.\n\nIn another report released on March 10, Morgan Stanley also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $1,146.00 price target.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 140 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of LLY in relation to earlier this year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Now, a new study funded by Eli Lilly reports that people without diabetes can lose up to 13% of their starting weight in 6 months using tirzepatide.\n\nIn November 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved one GLP-1 drug using tirzepatide as the active ingredient, called Zepbound , for chronic weight management in the case of adults with obesity or overweight, and with at least one weight-related condition.\n\nOriginally designed as a medication for type 2 diabetes , GLP-1 medications like Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and Ozempic (semaglutide) have been used off-label to help people lose weight.\n\nOver the last few years, there has been an increase in the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 agonists) for weight loss.\n\nEmily R. Hankosky, PhD , senior director of Cardiometabolic Health, Health Economics and Outcomes Research at Eli Lilly & Company, and corresponding author of this study, confirmed for Medical News Today that the participants were taking Mounjaro as an off-label treatment for weight management \u201cat the discretion of their prescribing physician.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, researchers observed that the rate of continuation for continuing to use tirzepatide for 6 months or more was 73.8%, which they say is higher than other studies have previously reported.\n\nAt the study\u2019s conclusion, scientists found that study participants lost on average 13% of their starting weight over 6 months.\n\nThe average age of selected study participants was 46 years, more than three-quarters were female, and they had an average body mass index (BMI) of 37.1 kilograms per square meter (kg/m 2 ).\n\nFor this study, researchers analyzed medical data for about 4,100 people without a type 2 diabetes diagnosis listed in the Healthcare Integrated Research Database .\n\nDyslipidemia was the most common obesity-related complication among participants, followed by hypertension (high blood pressure) and anxiety .\n\nAdditionally, scientists found that about 74% of participants had one or more obesity-related complications, while about 51% had two or more complications.\n\nDuring their study, researchers also reported that about 32% of participants who started tirzepatide had class 3 obesity with a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or more.\n\nMNT had the opportunity to speak with Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study.\n\nAli, who was not involved in this research, commented that the findings are in line with what other studies have shown regarding the benefits of tirzepatide.\n\n\u201cAdditional research always helps to define the patients who will benefit the most from this medication, and what kind of long term effects it has,\u201d Ali told us. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re finding as people are using this medication, they\u2019re seeing the benefits of the weight loss, and it\u2019s hard to separate the effects of the medicine from the weight loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing an improvement in their high blood pressure and other medical conditions associated with being overweight, and so there\u2019s a lot of benefits to the weight loss,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd this is one of the most effective medications available now for this [weight loss].\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as we learn more about it, there may be broader indications or they might apply to patients who are at lower weights,\u201d Ali added.",

Circular Genomics was selected to join the community at Gateway Labs, a best-in-class innovation hub that connects pioneering biotechs to Eli Lilly and Company's expertise, based on its cutting-edge circRNA platform technologies and promising diagnostic programs for neurological disorders.\n\n\"Joining Lilly Gateway Labs is a pivotal step for Circular Genomics,\" said Paul Sargeant, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Circular Genomics. \"We believe that tapping into Lilly's powerful neuroscience expertise, coupled with the operational support, resources, and scientific engagement available through Gateway Labs, will significantly advance the development of groundbreaking diagnostic and prognostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nIn September 2024 , Circular Genomics launched the early access program for MindLight \u2122, the first circRNA biomarker-based blood test designed to predict the likelihood of whether a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) will respond, or not, to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant treatment. This proprietary test is a best-in-class prognostic tool developed on Circular Genomics' circRNA platform that has the potential to provide critical predictions for a wide range of diseases. Circular Genomics' pipeline includes a number of novel diagnostic and prognostic circRNA assays in development, one of which has been demonstrated to effectively diagnose patients at high risk of AD progression and stratify their risk with very high accuracy. The potential clinical applications of the company's innovative biomarker technology range from patient stratification and candidate selection for clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments to monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Circular Genomics' move to Gateway Labs at the premier One Alexandria Square Megacampus aims to advance the use of circRNA biomarkers for the development of highly specialized and accurate AD diagnostic and prognostic blood tests.\n\n\"Our circRNA platform is revolutionizing the diagnosis and therapeutic management of brain disorders by introducing robust and highly selective brain-derived biomarker assays. Our approach has been clinically validated with our recently launched MindLight test for the management of patients with major depressive disorder and is now expanding to Alzheimer's disease,\" said Nikolaos Mellios, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of Circular Genomics. \"Partnering with Lilly Gateway Labs will significantly accelerate our mission to integrate precision medicine into the standard of care for neurology and significantly improve patient outcomes.\"\n\nLilly announced the first Gateway Labs innovation hub in South San Francisco in 2019 to speed the discovery of breakthrough medicines, tools, and technologies through collaboration with local biotech companies. Today, there are four locations across the U.S., including the new sites in San Diego and Boston, and ongoing global expansions which underscore how this innovative model meets the needs of life science communities. As a member of Gateway Labs in San Diego, Circular Genomics will have access to Lilly's scientific and operational expertise, a state-of-the-art wet lab facility, resources, networking, and an individualized plan tailored to the success of the MindLight program.\n\nAbout MindLight\n\nMindLight is a biomarker-based blood test that can be ordered by a physician or licensed healthcare provider. The blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis, and the results are sent back to the physician after 3-5 days of processing. The ordering physician will receive the final test report which presents the patient's test results in an easy-to-read and clinically actionable format. Visit www.mindlighttest.com for more details about MindLight.\n\nAbout Circular Genomics\n\nCircular Genomics is the world-leading developer of circular RNA-based precision medicine tools, data and diagnostics for psychiatry and neurology. Leveraging exclusive licenses and pioneering technologies in circular RNA, we are reshaping the standard of care for major depressive disorder and other neurological diseases. Initial products include assays to assess and tailor optimal treatment protocols for individual patients, validating treatment effectiveness within days to weeks rather than many months.

            "content": "Given common questions of fact and law raised in complaints brought throughout the federal court system, all GLP-1 lawsuits have been centralized as part of a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where they are currently being overseen by U.S. District Judge Karen Marston.\n\nTo effectively manage the rapidly growing litigation, Judge Marston established a pretrial process that directed the parties to focus early discovery and motions practice on resolving a number of \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issues in the GLP-1 lawsuits, including whether plaintiffs should be required to present specific diagnostic testing evidence to substantiate their injuries, whether the claims are preempted by federal law, and whether there is sufficient general causation evidence linking gastrointestinal injuries to GLP-1 drugs, which is expected to address whether the failure to warn claims survive.\n\nIn a motion (PDF) filed on March 5, Eli Lilly called for Judge Marston to issue an order requiring contemporaneous objective testing as the only means by which a gastroparesis injury can be diagnosed. Although plaintiffs\u2019 experts have maintained that there is more than one reliable way to diagnose the condition, Eli Lilly wants the judge to exclude those opinions from being presented at trial.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority\u2014more than 80 percent\u2014of Plaintiffs in this MDL allege gastroparesis as an injury. One of the defining features of gastroparesis is delayed gastric emptying, accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms like early fullness after meals, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, belching, and bloating,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThese symptoms are non-specific; they overlap with many other, more common conditions; and they do not alone reliably indicate delayed gastric emptying or gastroparesis.\u201d\n\nThe manufacturer claims that gastroparesis is misdiagnosed as much as 80% of the time without objective testing. Plaintiffs have not yet responded to the motion, and it is unclear how many claims would be affected by the motion, if Judge Marston approves it.\n\nThe lawyers involved in the litigation are scheduled to meet with Judge Marston for a status conference tomorrow, on March 18.\n\nAccording to an agenda (PDF) submitted by the parties last week, the pending motion to require contemporaneous diagnostic testing in gastroparesis lawsuits is not expected to be addressed by the court at the conference. However, the parties have asked Judge Marston to review deposition protocols, a coordination order and a short form complaint that future plaintiffs can use to file their lawsuits.\n\nAfter the \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issues are resolved, and if the lawsuits are cleared to move forward, Judge Marston is expected to schedule a series of early bellwether trials, which will test how juries may respond to certain evidence and testimony likely to be repeated throughout the litigation.\n\nDue to the time needed to resolve the \u201ccross-cutting\u201d issues and then select and prepare a group of early cases for trial, the first GLP-1 lawsuits are unlikely to go before federal juries until at least 2027.\n\nWhile the outcomes of these early test cases will not be binding on other claims, they will be closely watched and may help the parties negotiate GLP-1 settlements to resolve large numbers of lawsuits in the future.",

Around 90pc of eligible obese patients would not be able to get the jab on the NHS.\n\nNice has claimed its decision was made \u201cin order to protect other vital NHS services\u201d after healthcare chiefs warned they needed a slow rollout to set-up new services and train staff up to monitor patients on the jab.\n\nStill, it has been a source of much frustration within Eli Lilly, which says it is still waiting for details on which patients should be prioritised.

Furthermore, the company's decision to construct new manufacturing sites in the U.S., creating thousands of jobs, indicates an aggressive expansion strategy. Such advances likely contributed to Eli Lilly's share price increase of 5.05% over the last quarter, notwithstanding a broader market decline of 4.4% amid economic uncertainties and a slump in the tech sector.

            "content": "Purdue University, in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Merck & Co., launched the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium in January to pioneer advances in making medicines, with a focus on sterile injectables and innovative aseptic manufacturing technology. Leading this consortium is Elizabeth Topp, a professor in the Purdue University Department of Industrial and Molecular Pharmaceutics and the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, and expert in solid state chemistry. We asked her about the benefits and challenges of industrial and academic collaboration.\n\nWhat led you to specialize in the chemistry of solids, and how does this focus contribute to the development of more stable pharmaceuticals?\n\n\n\nI started my career at the University of Kansas, where I had the privilege of working with three outstanding pharmaceutical chemists: Ron Borchardt, Val Stella, and Dick Schowen. At the time, I had some background in pharmaceutical solids, and they were kind enough to include me in new projects and proposals that merged their expertise in stability and drug degradation with my interests in the solid state.\n\nMost drugs degrade in some way. Understanding how they degrade \u2013 and how fast \u2013 can help us design formulations that protect the drug until it can be administered to the patient. Many orally delivered drugs are formulated as solid tablets or capsules. Drugs for injection are usually administered as liquids but can be formulated as solids that are re-dissolved (reconstituted) before use. The extra steps to dry and re-dissolve are often needed because the drug is unstable in solution.\n\nGiven the challenges with mRNA degradation, what innovative approaches is your team exploring to enhance the stability of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics?\n\n\n\nThe mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are shipped and stored at ultracold temperatures (down to -80\u00b0C) because mRNA is very unstable. In a sense, mRNA is set up to fail. mRNA is a linear polymer make up of monomers called nucleotides, each containing a phosphate group, a ribose (a type of sugar), and a nucleobase.\n\nDegradation occurs when part of the ribose (the \u201cR\u201d in \u201cmRNA\u201d) attacks the nearby bond linking two nucleotides together (a phosphodiester bond), so that the chain falls apart. Steven Ferguson and our team at the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) in Dublin are working on chemical modifications of mRNA that would make that degradation reaction impossible. Our group is also working on improving our fundamental understanding of the factors that affect mRNA degradation, so that we know, for example, which parts of the molecular are the most vulnerable.\n\nCan you explain the significance of understanding reactions in the amorphous solid state and how this knowledge impacts drug formulation and shelf life?\n\n\n\nMost drugs are unstable in some way \u2013 and it\u2019s a good thing! We\u2019d like medicines to get into our bodies, treat medical problems, and then go away by degrading into harmless, inactive compounds. Problems occur when the drug degrades before it does its job rather than after \u2013 in the vial or on the shelf, rather than after providing treatment. To minimize reactions \u201con the shelf\u201d, many drugs are formulated in solid forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, or frozen solutions. That often works because most reactions are much slower in solids than in solution. Just making a solid doesn\u2019t guarantee that degradation will be slow enough, though. If we can\u2019t slow down degradation enough by making a solid, we\u2019re often out of tactics \u2013 and a very promising drug candidate can\u2019t become a product that reaches patients.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium?\n\n\n\nOur Institute is named for Purdue alumnus William D. (\u201cBill\u201d) Young and his wife Sherry. Bill graduated from Purdue in 1966 and, after a stint at Eli Lilly, took a job with Genentech, a company that was just a start-up at the time. While at Genentech, Bill and his team developed the manufacturing process for Humulin\u00ae, the first recombinant human insulin and the product that launched the biotech revolution in pharma.\n\nOur mission as the Young Institute is simple: to honor Bill and his family by starting the next revolution in pharmaceutical manufacturing. It\u2019s important to do that in collaboration with industry because they know what their pain points are, and because they\u2019re the ones doing the manufacturing. We\u2019re thrilled that both Lilly and Merck have agreed to join us on this journey \u2013 and we\u2019re keen to have other pharma companies join us, as well as those in related sectors.\n\nCould you elaborate on the specific advanced aseptic manufacturing technologies the consortium aims to develop?\n\n\n\nSpecific technologies that we\u2019re interested in include:\n\nNew unit operations for drug product manufacturing. For example, Young Institute Co-Director Alina Alexeenko and her team are developing radiofrequency assisted lyophilization as a way of making lyophilization much faster while maintaining product quality.\n\nApplications of artificial intelligence to enable real-time process control to optimize efficiency or manage supply chains.\n\nDevelopment of digital twins and other computational models of manufacturing processes, enabling process changes and deviations to be simulated without using physical equipment.\n\nRobotics to remove humans from sterile manufacturing environments, protecting drug products from human-borne bacteria, and protecting human operators from exposure to high potency drugs.\n\nAutomated visual inspection of vials, enabling injectable drug products to be inspected for particles and microbial contamination, a process currently done largely by human operators.\n\nDevelopment of in-line sensors, enabling product quality to be assessed in real-time and reducing reliance on off-line testing.\n\nIn what ways will the consortium contribute to the education and training of the next generation of pharmaceutical scientists and engineers?\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re involved in many exciting initiatives on the Purdue campus, designed to engage students with pharmaceutical manufacturing at many different levels. For example, in summer 2025, we\u2019ll host a week-long introduction to pharma manufacturing for college students. The program is sponsored by NIIMBL (the National Institute for Innovation in Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing) and will involve Ivy Tech Community College, Eli Lilly, Simtra, and Biocrossroads. We\u2019re also a partner in Heartland BioWorks, which aims to transform Central Indiana into a global leader in biotechnology and biomanufacturing. Training is an integral part of that mission.\n\nAre there plans to involve other stakeholders, such as additional pharmaceutical companies or startups, in the consortium's initiatives?\n\n\n\nYes, absolutely! We\u2019re actively recruiting companies across the value chain to join the Young Institute consortium. We have a tiered membership structure that encourages participation at different levels by a variety of stakeholders. Founding members make a significant investment and help to set the direction and focus areas for the consortium. Tier 1 members participate in our pre-competitive research programs, working together with one another and with founding members to select research projects. Tier 2 members have a low barrier to entry, enabling participation by start-ups, non-profits, and other academic institutions. We\u2019re also actively working to engage with federal agencies because regulatory oversight is so important to all aspects of pharma manufacturing.\n\nWhat inspired you to lead this consortium, and what do you envision as its long-term impact on the pharmaceutical industry?\n\n\n\nA big part of my inspiration has been the three Co-Directors of the Young Institute, Purdue faculty members Alina Alexeenko (College of Engineering), Eric Munson (College of Pharmacy), and Garth Simpson (College of Science). Over several years, they conceived the idea of a pharmaceutical manufacturing institute and then invited me to serve as the director. Additional inspiration has come from our colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry who\u2019ve talked to us about manufacturing opportunities and challenges. In addition, Bill Young and the other members of our Advisory Council have been tremendous sources of advice and encouragement.",

The questions seek to determine whether contracts between pharma and telehealth companies could violate the federal anti-kickback statute. The lawmakers, led by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in October sent similar letters to Pfizer and Lilly demanding answers about their relationships with the telehealth prescribers, which patients can access through websites PfizerForAll and LillyDirect, which also offer patients the ability to fill prescriptions for their medications online. The questions to telehealth companies highlight the regulatory gray area created when virtual care providers market specific drugs. Pharmaceutical companies\u2019 marketing is closely regulated, limiting the claims they can make about a medication\u2019s safety and efficacy, and requiring disclosure of side effects and contraindications. Telehealth companies that prescribe a range of medications have not been held to the same standards.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to terminate four demonstration projects at the end of 2025, closing out models affecting primary care, kidney care and healthcare payments in the state of Maryland, The Wall Street Journal says. The agency will also make changes to other projects, including dropping a planned initiative that would offer certain generic drugs to Medicare enrollees for $2. CMS said its planned terminations would save nearly $750 million, and an agency official said the projects would affect millions of patients. The projects were offered through the CMS Innovation Center, a special office that launches and tests new ideas in the agency\u2019s programs, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

This form of breast cancer generally has a favorable prognosis and is primarily managed with hormone therapy to suppress hormone-driven tumor growth.\n\nAccording to DelveInsight's estimates, around 211,000 new cases of HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer were reported in the US in 2024. Over the past decade, endocrine therapy has remained the cornerstone of treatment, including for cases with visceral involvement. The current preferred approach involves combining endocrine therapy\u2014using aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant\u2014with CDK4/6 inhibitors.\n\nThe approval of CDK4/6 inhibitors has significantly transformed the treatment landscape for HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer. Currently, five selective CDK4/6 inhibitors\u2014ENHERTU, DATROWAY, IBRANCE, KISQALI, and VERZENIO\u2014are used in combination with endocrine therapy. In November 2023, the FDA approved TRUQAP (capivasertib) in combination with FASLODEX for patients with advanced HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer harboring specific biomarker alterations (PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN).\n\nThe NCCN Guidelines have designated KISQALI as the only Category 1 Preferred CDK4/6 inhibitor for first-line treatment in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, strengthening its position in the U.S. market. This led to KISQALI recovering its lost market share, with its U.S. revenue contribution rebounding to 50%, following declines to 46% in 2020, 36% in 2021, and 38% in 2022.\n\nIn January 2025, the FDA approved DATROWAY for patients with unresectable or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer (IHC 0, IHC 1+, or IHC 2+/ISH-) who had previously received endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy. Additionally, ENHERTU was approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic HR+, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer that had progressed after at least one prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting.\n\nAlso, in January 2025, Roche reported positive topline results from its Phase III INAVO120 trial, assessing ITOVEBI in combination with IBRANCE and fulvestrant for patients with PIK3CA-mutated HR+/HER2\u2212, endocrine-resistant, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer.\n\nAmong the seven major markets, the US accounted for the largest market share in HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer, generating USD 7.5 billion in revenue in 2023. The market is expected to experience substantial growth from 2025 to 2034, driven by the introduction of novel therapeutic options.\n\nDiscover more about the breast cancer market in detail @ Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer Market Report\n\nEmerging Competitors of VERZENIO\n\nSome of the competing emerging key players in HR+/HER2- breast cancer market are, Merck (KEYTRUDA), Arvinas (ARV-471 (vepdegestrant)), Olema Pharmaceuticals (OP1250 (palazestrant)), Celcuity (Gedatolisib), Roche (Giredestrant (RG6171, GDC-9545); Inavolisib), AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo (Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd)), AstraZeneca (Camizestrant (AZD9833); Capivasertib), Eli Lilly (LY3484356/Imlunestrant), Sermonix Pharmaceuticals (Lasofoxifene), Veru Pharma (Enobosarm), DualityBio/BioNtech (DB-1303), Evgen Pharma (SFX-01), Carrick Therapeutics (Samuraciclib (CT-7001)), EQRx/G1 Therapeutics (Lerociclib), Immutep (Eftilagimod Alpha (LAG-3lg/IMP321)), and others.\n\nTo know more about the number of competing drugs in development, visit @ VERZENIO Market Positioning Compared to Other Drugs\n\nKey Milestones of VERZENIO\n\nIn 2024, Phase III trials did not meet primary endpoints or were terminated for futility.

Favorable reimbursement policies and increasing awareness among healthcare providers also contribute to its adoption.\n\nHowever, its adoption may be hindered by regulatory hurdles and potential side effects, including severe or life-threatening lung inflammation and serious liver problems. High treatment costs and access disparities in certain regions could also limit market penetration. Competition from other CDK4/6 inhibitors such as IBRANCE and KISQALI poses a challenge, along with concerns over long-term safety data. Additionally, the Phase III CYCLONE-2 trial failed to meet primary endpoints in mCRPC, which may impact its broader clinical prospects and investor confidence.\n\nDive deeper to get more insight into VERZENIO's strengths & weaknesses relative to competitors @ VERZENIO Market Drug Report\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1 Report Introduction 2 VERZENIO: Eli Lilly and Company 2.1 Product Overview 2.2 Other Development Activities 2.3 Clinical Development 2.4 Clinical Trials Information 2.5 Safety and Efficacy 2.6 Product Profile 2.7 Market Assessment 2.7.1 The 7MM Analysis 2.7.1.1 Cost Assumptions and Rebate 2.7.1.2 Pricing Trends 2.7.1.3 Analogue Assessment 2.7.1.4 Launch Year and Therapy Uptake 2.7.2 The United States Market Analysis 2.7.3 EU4 and the United Kingdom Market Analysis 2.7.3.1 Germany 2.7.3.2 France 2.7.3.3 Italy 2.7.3.4 Spain 2.7.3.5 UK 2.7.4 Japan Market Analysis 2.8 Market Drivers 2.9 Market Barriers 2.10 SWOT Analysis 3 Key Cross of Marketed Competitors of VERZENIO 4 Key Cross of Emerging Competitors of VERZENIO\n\nRelated Reports\n\nCDK4/6 Inhibitor Market\n\nCDK4/6 Inhibitor Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key CDK4/6 inhibitor companies including Pfizer, Prelude Therapeutics, G1 Therapeutics, Pepper Bio, among others.\n\nMetastatic HR+/HER2\u2212 Breast Cancer Market\n\nMetastatic HR+/HER2\u2212 Breast Cancer Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key metastatic HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer companies including Pfizer, Novartis, Stemline Therapeutics, Olema Pharmaceuticals, Arvinas, Immutep, AstraZeneca, Roche, Genentech, Evexta Bio, EQRx, Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Celcuity, Veru Pharma, Evgen Pharma, Eli Lilly, Biotheryx, among others.\n\nHR+/HER2\u2212 Breast Cancer Pipeline\n\nHR+/HER2\u2212 Breast Cancer Pipeline Insight \u2013 2025 report provides comprehensive insights about the pipeline landscape, pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and non-clinical stage products, and the key HR+/HER2\u2212 breast cancer companies, including Regor Therapeuics, Seagen Inc., CytomX Therapeutics, Taizhou EOC Pharma, Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Tyme, Inc., Seagen Inc., Context Therapeutics, Eisai Inc., Shanghai Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceutical Co., Kind Pharmaceuticals, Merus N.V., Atossa Therapeutics, Roche, among others.\n\nBreast Cancer Market\n\nBreast Cancer Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast \u2013 2034 report deliver an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the market trends, market drivers, market barriers, and key breast cancer companies, including Veru, Sanofi, Roche, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, EQRx, Gilead, Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Evgen Pharma, Tyme, Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo, among others.\n\nAbout DelveInsight\n\nDelveInsight is a leading Business Consultant and Market Research firm focused exclusively on life sciences.

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) closed the latest trading day at $822.27, indicating a -0.22% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.49%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.22%.\n\nThe drugmaker's stock has dropped by 4.73% in the past month, falling short of the Medical sector's loss of 1.05% and outpacing the S&P 500's loss of 8.15%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Eli Lilly will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.60, up 78.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $12.72 billion, indicating a 45.03% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $23.47 per share and a revenue of $59.92 billion, indicating changes of +80.68% and +33.02%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Eli Lilly. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.22% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Eli Lilly is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Eli Lilly currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 35.12. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.41, which means Eli Lilly is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can also see that LLY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.32. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.32.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.",

            "content": "Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger has maintained their bullish stance on LLY stock, giving a Buy rating on March 10.\n\nDavid Risinger has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors related to Eli Lilly & Co\u2019s competitive positioning and product performance. One key factor is the promising results from Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide, which demonstrated significant weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients, comparable to Novo Nordisk\u2019s CagriSema in similar trials. This positions Eli Lilly favorably in the weight management market, especially given the manufacturing complexities and future capacity uncertainties surrounding CagriSema.\n\nAdditionally, Eli Lilly\u2019s ability to achieve substantial weight loss results with tirzepatide, as evidenced by the SURMOUNT-2 trial, reinforces its potential market advantage. The trial showed up to 15.5% absolute weight loss, which aligns closely with Novo Nordisk\u2019s findings, yet with a more straightforward manufacturing process. These factors, combined with the anticipated delay in CagriSema\u2019s regulatory filings until 2026, support the Buy rating for Eli Lilly\u2019s stock, as the company is well-positioned to capitalize on its current market strengths.\n\nRisinger covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Eli Lilly & Co, Regeneron, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. According to TipRanks, Risinger has an average return of 10.3% and a 57.49% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released on March 10, Morgan Stanley also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $1,146.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "One particular healthcare stock has shown its ability to soar on good news -- and it's had plenty of it. This year the company reported solid results from trials of a candidate meant to address one of today's hottest growth areas: weight loss. The weight loss drug market may reach $130 billion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs Research, an increase from its earlier estimate of $100 billion.\n\nViking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) saw its shares rise 121% in one trading session after its initial clinical trial report back in February. The stock has since pulled back from that high point, yet it continued to advance, heading for an annual increase of about 170%. Investors are optimistic about Viking's ability to carve out share in the weight loss drug market, which is now dominated by pharma giants Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO).\n\nThis up-and-coming biotech player may be on the right path, but still, investors should proceed with caution. That's because this skyrocketing stock comes with a hidden risk. Let's find out more.\n\nAn investor looks pensively at something on a laptop.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nViking's most advanced program\n\nFirst, though, a bit of background on Viking and its programs: The company specializes in the treatment of metabolic diseases and rare diseases, but its most advanced program -- and the one attracting a good deal of attention -- is the one aiming to treat obesity. Viking's candidate, VK2735, generated fantastic results in a phase 2 study, and the company soon aims to launch a phase 3 trial. This is for the injectable version of the investigational drug.\n\nViking also is studying an oral version of VK2735, and after positive phase 1 results, the company aims to launch a phase 2 trial in the current quarter.\n\nBoth versions of VK2735 operate in the same way as Eli Lilly's star weight loss drug, Zepbound. All three belong to a class known as GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, drugs that act on two hormonal pathways involved in the process of digestion. They've shown their ability to both regulate blood sugar levels and control appetite, helping patients quickly shed pounds.\n\nLilly's Zepbound has brought in blockbuster revenue in less than one full year of commercialization, and demand has surpassed supply. The big pharma also sells the same molecule -- tirzepatide -- under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. But doctors have prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss too, and it's been bringing in billion-dollar revenue.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy\n\nThe story is the same for Novo Nordisk, with its drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. They're known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, acting on one hormonal pathway, and have produced results similar to those of Eli Lilly's drugs.\n\nWhy are investors so excited about Viking if Lilly and Novo Nordisk already dominate the market? The Lilly and Novo Nordisk drugs are injectables, and must be self-administered weekly. Results from the phase 2 trial of Viking's VK2735 injectable form show that monthly dosing may be possible. This is positive because it increases convenience for patients -- most people would prefer an injection once every month over going through it on a weekly basis. Even better, Viking's pill formulation avoids needles altogether, and makes it easy for patients to take the treatment on the go.\n\nBut it's important to remember that Lilly and Novo Nordisk aren't sitting on their laurels. They're working on better weight loss drugs -- and these candidates are in phase 3 trials, meaning if all goes well, they could reach commercialization before Viking's potential products. Lilly and Novo Nordisk each have an oral candidate as well as an injectable that's expected to produce better results than their current treatments.\n\nNew Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk drugs ahead\n\nSo the hidden risk for Viking is the Lilly and Novo Nordisk drug candidates that haven't yet reached commercialization -- but could be on the way.\n\nDoes this mean investors should forget about Viking? Not necessarily. The biotech, if successful, could still carve out market share due to the great need for weight loss drugs. There's room for more than a couple of companies to grow revenue in this area. But it's important for investors to remember that Viking's candidates aren't just competing with the Lilly and Novo Nordisk drugs of today -- but also with those big pharmas' potential drugs of tomorrow.\n\nViking is still a great biotech stock to buy today, but only if you can accept that risk.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "snippet": "Like many pharma stocks, Eli Lilly (LLY -0.27%) offers investors a bit of safety -- and it's an element you can count on during any economic environment.",

            "content": "Like many pharma stocks, Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) offers investors a bit of safety -- and it's an element you can count on during any economic environment. This is because patients need their medicines and will continue to order them through good times and more difficult times as well. But Lilly also is bringing investors another element that isn't as common in the industry -- and that's explosive growth.\n\nThis is thanks to the company's development of treatments in an area that's in high demand and is forecast to continue along this path throughout the decade. I'm talking about weight loss drugs. Lilly makes tirzepatide, commercialized under the name Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. But doctors have prescribed either one for patients aiming to shed pounds. Both of these products quickly became blockbusters and, along with drugs from Novo Nordisk, dominate the market.\n\nAll of this has helped Lilly's revenue climb in the double digits in recent quarters and the stock price to take off. The shares have advanced more than 200% over the past three years. Now the question is: Is it too late to get in on this weight loss giant, or is Lilly stock still a buy? Let's find out.\n\nWhat's behind Lilly's double-digit revenue growth\n\nSo, first let's talk about the Eli Lilly story so far. It's important to remember that Lilly isn't only a weight loss drug company; it also sells a wide variety of products across treatment areas -- from neuroscience to immunology. And in the recent quarter, even if we exclude the weight loss treatments, revenue climbed 20%, showing Lilly's other products are also contributing to growth. So Lilly isn't dependent on just one or two products, and that's positive. Instead, these high-growth weight loss drugs are a fantastic addition to an already solid portfolio. With them, Lilly's quarterly revenue surged 45%.\n\nTirzepatide is part of a class of drugs known as dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. These act on hormones involved in the digestion process to help control blood sugar levels and appetite. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first gave it the nod for type 2 diabetes in 2022 then approved it specifically for weight loss in 2023.\n\nDemand for tirzepatide has been so high that it immediately landed on the FDA's drug-shortage list following approval and remained there until recently. The situation was the same for Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, commercialized as Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs all have produced impressive results in clinical trials and in the real world, and that has kept them flying off pharmacy shelves. On top of this, analysts expect the weight loss drug market to soar from today's levels. Morgan Stanley predicts a 15-fold increase to more than $100 million by the end of the decade.\n\nWill Viking and Amgen beat Lilly?\n\nOf course, by that time, Lilly and Novo Nordisk may see competitors emerge. For example, Viking Therapeutics is studying its dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist in late-stage trials right now. And just recently Amgen said it's started two late-stage trials for its monthly injectable candidate (Lilly and Novo Nordisk drugs are weekly injectables). If all goes well for these or other potential rivals, Lilly may face more competition in the years to come.\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Is Eli Lilly a buy? It's true that competition in the weight loss drug market is a risk, but there's reason to be confident about Lilly's potential to continue dominating the space. This is because Lilly isn't standing still; it's also pushing exciting weight loss candidates through the pipeline. So, there's room for smaller companies to succeed in the market, but that doesn't mean they will disturb today's leaders.\n\nWhat's ahead for Eli Lilly\n\nLilly expects data readouts this year from a phase 3 trial of retatrutide, a weight loss candidate it's suggested may be even more effective than its current drugs, and orforglipron, a weight loss candidate in pill form. And Lilly may even submit orforglipron for regulatory approval as early as this year. If Lilly is able to commercialize a new weight loss product in the next few years, it could reinforce its leadership in the market.\n\nConsidering Lilly's growth, the stock has traded at valuations you'd expect to see for a growth stock, reaching as high as 75 times forward-earnings estimates over the past year. But valuation has come down significantly from that peak to 37 times these expectations, and this bargain price, along with the company's potential for lasting leadership in the weight loss drug market, makes it a fantastic buy today.",

            "content": "Lilly is hopeful that sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound should pick up in 2025 as it launches the drugs in new international markets and ramps up manufacturing in the first half of the year. Since 2020, Lilly has committed more than $50 billion for manufacturing capacity for Zepbound and Mounjaro in the United States and Europe.\n\nHowever, quarter-over-quarter growth of Zepbound and Mounjaro in 2024 was hurt by supply and channel dynamics. Slower-than-expected growth and unfavorable channel dynamics hurt sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound in the second half, raising concerns about moderating demand for these drugs.\n\nDespite being on the market for less than three years, Mounjaro and Zepbound became key top-line drivers for Lilly in 2024, with demand rising rapidly. Mounjaro and Zepbound generated combined sales of $16.5 billion in 2024, accounting for around 36% of the company\u2019s total revenues.\n\nLet\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play the stock after the price rise this year.\n\nThis led the stock to recover after the correction in the second half of 2024. Monday\u2019s decline was a negative reaction to a rival\u2019s news, from which we believe Lilly can recover in the coming days.\n\nNevertheless, investors were impressed with the company\u2019s outlook for 2025 provided in February, particularly expectations for improvement in sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound. Lilly is hopeful that sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound will pick up in 2025 as it ramps up manufacturing capacity and through label and geography expansions.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s stock has risen 7.5% year to date. Shares of Lilly struggled a little in the second half of 2024 after a solid rise in 2023 and the first half of 2024. The primary reason for the stock\u2019s correction in the second half of 2024 was disappointing sales of its popular GLP-1 products, Mounjaro and Zepbound, due to slower-than-expected growth.\n\nTop-line data from the phase III REDEFINE 2 study on Novo Nordisk\u2019s CagriSema showed that treatment with the drug led to a weight loss of 15.7% after 68 weeks compared to a reduction of 3.1% with placebo in people with obesity and type II diabetes. However, the weight loss of 15.7% fell short of expectations as investors were probably expecting a more pronounced weight loss outcome at 68 weeks. Shares of Lilly declined as it is also investing actively in the popular obesity space.\n\nEli Lilly and Company \u2019s LLY shares dipped almost 5% on Monday after rival Novo Nordisk NVO announced disappointing data from a late-stage study on next-generation obesity drug, CagriSema.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLilly expects to launch Mounjaro in new markets outside of the United States and Europe throughout 2025. The launch of Mounjaro in new international markets is expected to contribute to the drug\u2019s sales growth in the second half of the year. Last month, Lilly announced that it is reducing prices of 7.5 mg and 10 mg doses of Zepbound for customers paying through a new self-pay program. The lowered price can improve access to the medicine.\n\nFollowing suit, NVO also announced that it is offering its obesity drug, Wegovy, at a discounted price of $499 per month to patients who do not have insurance coverage and pay by cash, which is less than half of its listed price.\n\nThe FDA also removed Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide medicines from its shortage list in December 2024 and NVO\u2019s semaglutide products from the list in late February. This means that the shortage of these products is resolved and the medicines are no longer in short supply.\n\nApprovals for new indications can also drive sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound higher. In late December, the FDA approved Zepbound for its second indication, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity. In addition, LLY filed tirzepatide for heart failure, which further expands the opportunity for the candidate. It also expects to announce data from a cardiovascular outcome study on tirzepatide this year.\n\nLLY\u2019s New Drugs & Pipeline Success\n\nOther than Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly has gained approvals for some other new drugs in the past couple of years. These include Omvoh for ulcerative colitis, BTK inhibitor Jaypirca for mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and Kisunla (donanemab) for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024.\n\nLilly expects its new drugs, Mounjaro, Zepbound, Omvoh, Jaypirca, Ebglyss and Kisunla, along with the expanded use of existing drugs, to drive sales growth in 2025. It also expects the potential launch of new medicines like imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer to contribute to growth in 2025.\n\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, with several mid to late-stage pipeline readouts expected in 2025.\n\nCompetition Heating Up in the Obesity Space\n\nThe obesity market is heating up and is expected to expand to $100 billion by 2030, according to data from Goldman Sachs. Lilly and Novo presently dominate the market.\n\nLilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development. These include two late-stage candidates, orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 small molecule, and triple-acting incretin, retatrutide (which combines GLP-1, GIP and glucagon), and some mid-stage candidates, bimagrumab, eloralintide and mazdutide. It expects data from phase III studies on orforglipron in type II diabetes and obesity in 2025. It also plans to file regulatory applications for orforglipron in obesity this year and for type II diabetes in 2026.\n\nSeveral companies like Amgen AMGN and Viking Therapeutics VKTX are also making rapid progress in the development of GLP-1-based candidates in their clinical pipeline.\n\nAMGN and VKTX\u2019s products can pose strong competition to Mounjaro/Zepbound and NVO\u2019s Ozempic/Wegovy in the future.\n\nLLY\u2019s Stock Price, Valuation and Estimates\n\nLilly\u2019s shares have risen 9.9% in the past year against a decrease of 2.2% for the industry.\n\nLLY Stock Outperforms Industry\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock is trading at a premium to the industry, as seen in the chart below.\n\nLLY Stock Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLLY Estimate Movement\n\nEstimates for Lilly\u2019s 2025 earnings have declined from $23.79 to $23.47 per share in the past 30 days, while those for 2026 have increased from $31.09 to $31.33 over the same timeframe.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in LLY Stock\n\nLilly has its share of problems. Sales of its key medicine, Trulicity, are declining in the United States due to competitive dynamics, including Mounjaro switches and supply constraints. Prices of most of Lilly\u2019s products are declining in the United States mainly due to lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. Lilly\u2019s U.S. net price has declined every year since 2021. In 2025, Lilly expects a mid-to-high single-digit percentage price decline, including U.S. Part D changes. Potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market is another headwind.\n\nHowever, Lilly\u2019s tremendous success with Mounjaro and Zepbound has made it the largest drugmaker with a market cap of around $825 billion. Lilly\u2019s stock has gone up by 492.6% in the past five years, mainly due to its successful new drug launches, particularly Mounjaro and Zepbound, and its solid pipeline potential. Lilly\u2019s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and others, making up for the decline in sales from Trulicity.\n\nIn 2025, Lilly expects to record revenues in the range of $58.0 billion to $61.0 billion, indicating an impressive 32% year-over-year growth.\n\nThough sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound were soft in the second half of 2024, we believe that over time, the supply issues for Mounjaro and Zepbound should be resolved as the company increases production capacity. Also, Lilly looks well placed to get approval for several new drugs and label expansions for marketed drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, in the next few years.\n\nOn capital allocation, LLY returned $3 billion to shareholders in 2024 via share repurchases and dividends. The board of directors of Lilly approved a new $15 billion stock buyback plan and also announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend, which bodes well for the stock.\n\nThough the stock looks quite expensive, we suggest investors who own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company retain it as it still has robust growth prospects.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pointed to Wall Street Journal reporting from last month on the millions of dollars that healthcare industry executives spent to dine with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida ahead of his inauguration.\n\nKennedy, according to the Journal, \u201cattended several of the dinners, but largely stayed quiet as Trump and others talked.\u201d\n\nWarren, Wyden, and Sanders wrote to Kennedy that \u201cthe dinners may have served as an opportunity for Big Pharma to gain insider access to both you and President Trump\u201d and asked the HHS chief to reveal information about the meetings with industry executives, including how many there have been since the November election and whether Medicare drug price negotiations or other critical matters were discussed.\n\n\u201cBig Pharma stands to profit immensely from a second Trump administration, especially if they can convince you and President Trump to abandon policies like Medicare drug price negotiations and patent reform that would save Americans hundreds of billions of dollars on lifesaving drugs,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cIndeed, the executives that attended these dinners have called on him to \u2018pause drug negotiations\u2019 \u2014 negotiations that are expected to save taxpayers $100 billion by 2032.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe the American public an explanation for why you took part in PhRMA\u2019s influence-peddling events with President Trump, what happened at these meetings, and whether they will affect your commitment to ensuring that Americans receive the relief they deserve from high drug prices,\u201d the senators added.\n\nRFK Jr. said he'd \"clean up corruption\" as HHS Secretary. So why'd he have dinner with Big Pharma executives at Mar-a-Lago with Trump? The American people deserve to know what kind of deals might have been made at those \"million-dollar\" dinners.\n\n\n\n[image or embed] \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@warren.senate.gov) March 10, 2025 at 4:29 PM\n\nThe Journal reported that the CEO of Pfizer, which pumped $1 million into Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, was among the executives who attended the private Mar-a-Lago dinners. Eli Lilly\u2019s chief executive also joined at least one of the dinners.\n\nThough Kennedy, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, has vocally criticized Big Pharma and its political influence, the industry did not lobby against his nomination to lead HHS, which oversees the Medicare drug price negotiations that began during the Biden administration.\n\nLast month, the head of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group and several pharma CEOs met with Trump as part of a campaign to weaken the price negotiations, which threaten drugmakers\u2019 ability to jack up prices at will.\n\nThe negotiations have yielded significant results, but Trump\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 an agency within HHS \u2014 has signaled it is open to altering the program.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s statement is far from an embrace of drug price negotiation,\u201d Wyden and other senators warned earlier this year, \u201cand appears to be opening the door to changes that could undermine Medicare\u2019s ability to get the best price possible on drugs.\u201d\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.

            "content": "A federal judge has effectively ended the ability of compounding pharmacies to make their own copies of Eli Lilly\u2019s weight loss and diabetes drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n\nIn a sealed decision filed late Wednesday, Judge Mark Pittman of the Northern District of Texas declined to issue an injunction to stop the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from declaring there was no longer a shortage of the medicines\u2019 active ingredient, tirzepatide.\n\nThe lawsuit against the FDA was brought in October by a trade organization representing compounding industry groups. The Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) alleged the agency was \u201cabruptly depriving patients of much needed treatment and artificially raising drug prices.\u201d\n\nCompounders had been allowed to produce and sell hundreds of thousands of their own versions of popular anti-obesity drugs, so long as the FDA considered them in shortage.\n\nCompounded drugs are sold at vastly lower prices than the branded versions, but drug companies and some obesity specialists have expressed concerns that some compounded products aren\u2019t FDA-approved.\n\nAfter the suit was filed, the FDA temporarily paused to reconsider the declaration to end the shortage but ultimately reaffirmed its decision in December. The agency said it would not take any enforcement action against compounders before the court ruled.\n\nThe agency at the time gave drug compounders a transition period to avoid patient care disruption. Smaller, state-licensed pharmacies had until Feb. 18 and now must immediately stop producing their own copies of the drugs.\n\nLarger outsourcing facilities, which are FDA-regulated and can create prescription-specific compounded drugs as well as bulk orders, must cease compounding, distributing or dispensing tirzepatide injections by March 19.\n\nThe OFA\u2019s lawsuit said the FDA made its decision to remove tirzepatide from the shortage list based only on statements from the manufacturer, \u201cwithout notice, without soliciting input from affected parties and the public, and without meaningful rationale.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Hill on Thursday, OFA Chair Lee Rosebush said the group \u201cis considering all of its options regarding the judgment, including an appeal.\u201d\n\nRosebush said he couldn\u2019t comment on specifics of the decision until the court unseals it.\n\nEli Lilly in a statement said the decision \u201cmarks the end of the road for mass compounding of risky, unapproved knockoffs that threaten the health and safety of Americans.\u201d\n\nAny company that continues mass compounding tirzepatide \u201cis breaking the law, and we will work with regulators and law enforcement to stop it,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\n\nA similar OFA lawsuit against the FDA for removing from the shortage list semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is pending.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

We\u2019ve also connected thousands of people injured by drugs and medical devices with top-ranked national law firms to take action against negligent corporations.\n\nCymbalta Class Action Certification\n\nIn October 2012, former users of the antidepressant Cymbalta filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The claim asserted that they, and other persons similarly situated, were harmed because the drug\u2019s maker, Lilly, failed to warn about the drug\u2019s withdrawal risks. A class action is a type of legal action in which plaintiffs join together to sue as a \u201cclass\u201d because they have similar claims against a common defendant or defendants. For any case to proceed as a class action, the court must certify the class. A \u201cputative\u201d class action refers to an action filed by a group of plaintiffs who believe their claims are related, but who have not yet received certification as a class. In August 2013, a group of plaintiffs (a putative class) filed a motion in the federal district court in California, seeking certification of classes of consumers in four states: California, Massachusetts, Missouri and New York.\n\nIn 2013, plaintiffs moved for certification of classes of consumers in CA, MA, MO and NY.\n\nHowever, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification on Dec. 18, 2014. Plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. Their case was put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court decided an unrelated case with similar legal issues involving Microsoft. When the Microsoft decision was issued in June 2017, Lilly pushed to have the putative class action against it dismissed based on the Microsoft ruling, which changed the law regarding class actions in a way that worked against the Cymbalta plaintiffs. The Ninth Circuit agreed with Lilly and dismissed the putative class action in October 2017. As of March 2025, there have been no new developments. Drugwatch\u2019s legal partners are currently not taking Cymbalta lawsuit cases.\n\nA Timeline of Cymbalta Lawsuits and Settlements\n\nEven before Cymbalta received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Lilly was looking at a potential lawsuit over its use. Key Cymbalta dates include:\n\n2020 The Ninth Circuit court denies the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to reopen their cases, and shortly after, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied.\n\n2018 Plaintiffs filed another appeal to reopen the cases in federal district court. That court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and plaintiffs appealed again to the Ninth Circuit.\n\n2017 Eli Lilly moves to dismiss the Strafford et al. v. Eli Lilly & Co. appeal, and in October 2017, the Ninth Circuit court dismisses the suit on jurisdictional grounds based on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Microsoft ruling. Lilly reports it has \u201creached a settlement framework\u201d in 140 pending Cymbalta lawsuits. The Ninth 9th Circuit considers plaintiffs\u2019 second appeal in Cymbalta class-action lawsuit.\n\nOctober 2015 The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) denies plaintiffs\u2019 second request for a Cymbalta MDL. Plaintiffs appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAugust 2015 Lilly records first of four verdicts in its favor in individual lawsuits over Cymbalta.\n\nJuly 2015 Plaintiffs again request an MDL, this time including more than 40 lawsuits.\n\nDecember 2014 The JPML denies plaintiffs' request for an MDL. The panel found, among other things, that most of the common discovery had already taken place and there was an overlap in plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. There could be \u201cinformal coordination with respect to the remaining common discovery, as well as other pretrial matters,\u201d making centralization of the cases unnecessary.\n\nAugust 2014 Plaintiffs in 25 federal lawsuits across the country petitioned the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to centralize the cases into a single multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District for the Central District of California.\n\nDecember 2013 South Carolina federal court rules in favor of Eli Lilly in lawsuit claiming the company failed to warn of withdrawal symptoms. Cymbalta users seek class-action certification in California, Massachusetts, Missouri and New York\n\nApril 2013 Lilly settles lawsuit with Peter Schilf\u2019s parents for undisclosed amount.\n\nOctober 2012 Former Cymbalta users file class-action lawsuit in California federal court.\n\n2005 Lilly agrees to an undisclosed settlement in Traci Johnson\u2019s death before a lawsuit is filed.\n\nDecember 2004 Shortly after being prescribed Cymbalta, 16-year-old Peter Schilf commits suicide on Christmas Eve. His parents file a lawsuit against Eli Lilly.\n\nAugust 2004 FDA approves Cymbalta as a treatment for major depressive disorder.\n\nFebruary 2004 College student Traci Johnson commits suicide while taking part in Cymbalta clinical trial. FDA later concludes suicide was not related to Cymbalta. Show More\n\nLawsuit Claims\n\nLawsuits against the pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly, say Cymbalta users face \u201csevere physiological and psychological symptoms when they attempt to stop\u201d taking the drug, including dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, nightmares, insomnia, diarrhea, anxiety, hyperhidrosis and vertigo. Most people may have taken the drug to treat depression or anxiety. But there are other FDA approved Cymbalta uses. These include treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia and certain kinds of chronic pain.\n\nOf their many claims in court documents, plaintiffs say Eli Lilly: \u201cOverstated the efficacy of Cymbalta\u201d and \u201cdownplayed and/or failed to state the true withdrawal side effects associated with Cymbalta\u201d\n\nFailed to properly warn patients about the risks and of the \u201cfrequency, severity, and/or duration of Cymbalta withdrawal\u201d\n\nBenefitted from patients who started taking Cymbalta again (becoming physically dependent on the drug) to avoid terrible side effects\n\nAdvertised the benefits of the drug, even those that were not proven\n\nProduced a defective drug\n\nThe lawsuits also say Eli Lilly deceived the public by including in the drug\u2019s label that only 1% of users experienced withdrawal symptoms, when in reality studies show between 44% and 50% suffered from discontinuation problems. Of those who had withdrawal effects, about half experienced moderate or persistent symptoms. And one in 10 experienced severe symptoms. The plaintiffs say \u201cnowhere on Cymbalta\u2019s label does it indicate the potential duration of withdrawal symptoms.\u201d\n\nPeople Who Filed Lawsuits\n\nMen and women who have filed Cymbalta withdrawal lawsuits say had they known the truth about the frequency, severity and duration of Cymbalta withdrawal they would not have started taking Cymbalta. Among the people who filed lawsuits against Eli Lilly are: Jennifer Saavedra Jennifer Saavedra filed suit in California against Eli Lilly after she tried to stop using Cymbalta and experienced brain zaps, body shaking and tunnel vision. It took her a year to recover. In the meantime, her life was disrupted. Her complaint claimed withdrawal symptoms were more prevalent than Lilly claimed and that the company misled the public. Saavedra\u2019s case eventually joined settlement proceedings, according to court documents from 2017. Melissa Strafford Melissa Strafford also filed her lawsuit in California. She was forced to continue using Cymbalta to avoid debilitating side effects. After she finally stopped taking the drug, she suffered for months. Her lawsuit accused Lilly of deceiving the public about the risks of the drug. The Strafford case was part of the putative class action that was ultimately dismissed by the Ninth Circuit in 2017.\n\nWithdrawal complications that lead patients and their families to file Cymbalta lawsuits include: Brain Zaps\n\nNausea\n\nSuicidal thoughts\n\nNightmares\n\nDizziness\n\nWeight changes\n\nPatients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior.\n\nMultidistrict Litigation Denied\n\nCounsel for plaintiffs in 25 federal court proceedings against Eli Lilly tried unsuccessfully to have the then-filed cases and an unspecified number of future cases coordinated into a federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The purpose of an MDL is to avoid duplication and inconsistencies in the pretrial procedures and rulings and to conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the courts. In a December 2014 order denying the MDL transfer, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation found, among other things, that most of the common discovery had already taken place and there was an overlap in plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, so there could be \u201cinformal coordination with respect to the remaining common discovery, as well as other pretrial matters,\u201d making centralization of the cases into an MDL unnecessary. Plaintiffs in all actions alleged: They suffered a variety of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing use of Cymbalta\n\nThe label for the drug failed to adequately warn of the risks of such symptoms\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s promotional campaigns for the drug overstated its efficacy while understating, downplaying or failing altogether to state its withdrawal side effects The panel said in its order that it had been informed of 21 additional related federal actions. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel subsequently filed a second petition seeking MDL consolidation. The panel denied the petition in October 2015. California Cymbalta Trials About 35 individual and multi-plaintiff cases were filed in California state court. Many of the cases have been consolidated in a California Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding in Los Angeles. The first individual product liability cases went to trial in August 2015 and resulted in verdicts in favor of Eli Lilly. Two of the plaintiffs filed notices of appeal. Herrera v. Eli Lilly & Co. Claudia Herrera\u2019s case against Eli Lilly became the first of four cases regarding Cymbalta withdrawal symptoms to go to trial in federal court in California in August 2015. According to Herrera\u2019s lawsuit, she began using Cymbalta in 2006 to treat her anxiety. In 2012, Herrera\u2019s doctor instructed her to slowly stop taking the drug. Herrera says she suffered electric-like \u201czaps,\u201d anxiety, spasms and suicidal thoughts, among other withdrawal symptoms, as a result. Herrera accused Eli Lilly of downplaying its warnings to make Cymbalta more marketable. The jury cleared Eli Lilly of liability. Herrera filed a notice of appeal after losing her trial. Cymbalta New York Trial California is not the only state that saw legal actions against Cymbalta\u2019s maker. In its 2015 annual report, Eli Lilly said it was \u201cnamed in approximately 140 lawsuits involving approximately 1,300 plaintiffs filed in various federal and state courts alleging injuries arising from discontinuation of treatment with Cymbalta.\u201d News reports from that same year say that the company faced more than 5,000 Cymbalta withdrawal cases. One publicized case is out of New York. McDowell v. Eli Lilly & Co. Jesse McDowell filed his lawsuit in New York, claiming Cymbalta\u2019s label was inaccurate. McDowell said he suffered \u201cserious and life-threatening withdrawal symptoms\u201d from Cymbalta. He argued that the drug\u2019s label was misleading because it said the symptoms occurred in patients \u201cat a rate of greater than or equal to 1%\u201d when the actual rates were closer to 50%. U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet dismissed the suit, ruling the label adequately warned doctors about possible withdrawal symptoms. The federal judge said the label\u2019s language followed FDA regulations.\n\nSuicide Settlement\n\nCymbalta was not on the market long before it became tied to the suicide of a 16-year-old boy. Peter Schilf began taking samples of the antidepressant given by his doctor in November 2004, just three months after the drug gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of depression. A month later, Schilf fatally shot himself on Christmas Eve. The FDA required its strongest warning, a black box warning, about suicide be added to the drug\u2019s label in 2005. Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Cymbalta or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Cymbalta is not approved for use in pediatric patients.\n\nEli Lilly Reports \u2018Settlement Structure\u2019 for Cymbalta Lawsuits\n\nIn Eli Lilly\u2019s 2018 annual report, the company reported it had reached a \u201csettlement structure\u201d in 140 Cymbalta lawsuits involving roughly 1,470 plaintiffs. The cases were pending in various state and federal courts and all involved patients who claimed injuries caused by discontinuing use of Cymbalta.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a settlement framework which provides for a comprehensive resolution of nearly all of these personal injury claims, filed or unfiled, alleging injuries from discontinuing treatment with Cymbalta. There can be no assurances, however, that a final settlement will be reached.\u201d",

The storied pharmaceutical company's shares lost nearly 5% of their value during the big market sell-off that day, and it wasn't only because of the general gloom. That drop compared rather unfavorably to the relatively light 2.7% swoon of the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%).\n\nNo, no, Novo\n\nThat negative investor reaction was directed at companies involved in the white-hot weight loss drug segment of the market (Eli Lilly is the pharmaceutical giant behind a popular one, Zepbound).\n\nThat morning, Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk announced the latest clinical trial results for an advanced obesity drug it's developing, CagriSema. Participants treated with CagriSema achieved weight loss of 15.7% after the 68-week duration of the trial. The drug seemed to have demonstrated a safe, well-tolerated profile.\n\nAlthough Novo Nordisk described this result as \"superior,\" it was well short of the 25% weight loss that the company had anticipated. Investor hopes were similarly high, so it's little wonder those folks were bearish on Novo Nordisk. They also punished fellow obesity drug developers like Eli Lilly in a sympathy sell-off.\n\nAn easily discouraged market\n\nI don't think investors in either company should give up because of these results. The weight loss drug segment is still quite new, and there will be many fits and starts by developers.\n\nZeroing in on Eli Lilly, the company is already well established with Zepbound, which should continue to sell briskly as the world waits for a more powerful and efficacious obesity drug to hit the market. Besides, the American pharmaceutical king has many other products currently on pharmacy shelves, and a wide and active pipeline.",

The additional assessments presented at AAD demonstrate significant improvements in disruptive symptoms, such as itch, across a range of patient groups.\u201d\n\nThe Phase III monotherapy trial ran for 152 weeks recruiting 1,188 patients across 321 international sites who had previously completed the company\u2019s ADvocate 1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate 2 (NCT04178967) monotherapy trials.

Santiago / Staff (Getty Images)\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) CEO David Ricks got a 10% raise in 2024, as a surge in demand for weigh-loss drugs has propelled the pharma giant into the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.\n\nRicks\u2019 total compensation for 2024 reached $29.2 million, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement, up from $26.6 million in 2023. When he became CEO in 2017, Ricks\u2019 annual compensation started at $15.8 million.\n\nIn that time, Eli Lilly has seen explosive growth, largely due to its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nBoth drugs belong to GLP-1 class of treatments, made famous by rival Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030.\n\nMounjaro brought in $11.5 billion in sales in 2024, while Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in annual revenue.\n\nOverall, Eli Lilly\u2019s total sales for the year across all its drugs amounted to $45 billion. The company projects that sales in 2025 will reach between $58 billion and $61 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong performance has also boosted its stock price. Eli Lilly\u2019s stock has climbed 10% over the past 12 months to about $842 a share. Over the last five years, the company\u2019s stock has surged nearly 500%\n\nWith a market cap of $754 billion, Eli Lilly is now the most valuable healthcare company in the world, ranking 12th overall. For comparison, the next closest healthcare companies are UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), with market caps of $448 billion and $406 billion, respectively.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

That's comparable to Eli Lilly's blockbuster, Zepbound, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a report to clients. He said CagriSema is also more difficult than Zepbound to manufacture due to the type of device it uses, and Novo has yet to lay out its manufacturing plans.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said CagriSema stood the best chance of outperforming Zepbound in this patient population \u2014 people with obesity and type 2 diabetes. But the results appears comparable to Zepbound.\n\n\"Therefore, we believe today's results are especially disappointing,\" he said in a client note.\n\nNovo Nordisk stock skidded 9.4% to 78.95. Shares undercut their 50-day moving average. Lilly stock also slipped 4.6% to 829.76.\n\nNovo Nordisk Stock: Testing A Combo\n\nCagriSema is a combination of Novo's semaglutide and a drug called cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which Novo sells as the diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss med Wegovy, mimics the GLP-1 hormone to lower appetite and improve blood sugar markers. Cagrilintide mimics the amylin hormone. The pancreas secretes amylin alongside insulin.\n\nIn the study, CagriSema appeared safe and well tolerated, Novo Nordisk said in its news release. The most common side effects mirrored the GLP-1 class and included gastrointestinal problems. Notably, Novo used a flexible dosing schedule, allowing patients to change their dosage throughout the study. By the end of the test, 61.9% of patients were on the highest dose.\n\nNovo expects to file for approval of CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAbbVie Enters The Obesity Arena.

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY, Financial) experienced a notable stock decline of 4.58% in recent market activity. This outpaced the broader market's fall, spurred by Novo Nordisk's announcement of underwhelming clinical trial results for its obesity drug, CagriSema. This news has cast a shadow over the weight loss drug segment, increasing investor wariness toward companies like Eli Lilly.\n\nWith a current market price of $829.76, Eli Lilly (LLY, Financial) remains a focal point for investors assessing the stock's intrinsic value. According to the GF Value metric, Eli Lilly is deemed \"Fairly Valued,\" with a GF Value of $848.20. This suggests a modest upside potential, aligning with the projected twelve-month GF Value estimate of $1,054.18.\n\nDespite the recent dip, Eli Lilly showcases robust financial health, marked by a strong Altman Z-Score of 8.72. The company's expanding operating margin of 38.86% is a positive sign, indicating improved profitability. Additionally, Eli Lilly's revenue per share exhibits consistent growth, supported by impressive long-term revenue growth metrics \u2013 31.9% over the past year and an average of 14.9% and 9.9% over the past five and ten years respectively. The company's commitment to innovation and an extensive product portfolio in neuroscience, cardiometabolic, cancer, and immunology further solidifies its market position.\n\nOne area of concern remains the company's high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 70.86, which could imply an overvalued stock relative to earnings. However, Eli Lilly's predictability rank of 3.5 reflects strong cash flow predictability and stability, enhancing its investment appeal amidst market volatility.\n\nEli Lilly's strategic growth and consistent dividend policy, with a 5-year dividend growth rate of 15.1%, make it an attractive option for income-focused investors. Despite issuing new debt, Eli Lilly's financial prudence and market leadership in the pharmaceutical sector continue to make it a significant player worth monitoring, even amid short-term market fluctuations.",

            "content": "When GLP-1 drugs recently became a trendy talking point for their impressive weight loss efficacy, their less-than-appealing aspects also came into focus, particularly gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nNausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain are all commonly reported by people dropping pounds with Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy (semaglutide) and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (tirzepatide). In fact, real world studies indicate these GI adverse events develop in between 40-70% of GLP-1 treated patients.\n\nWith discontinuation rates a concern for companies, drug developers and practitioners are working together to help patients manage the worst of these side effects so they can stay on drug and benefit from the significant weight loss generated by the popular injectables.\n\nIn a recent survey of 50 physicians conducted by strategic advisory firm DNB Markets and Back Bay Life Science Advisors, 94% of doctors ranked the benefit-safety profile as one of the most important factors in prescribing a weight loss medication.\n\nPhysicians seem to be clamoring for drugs with fewer side effects, Peter Bak, partner and managing director of Back Bay Life Science Advisors, told BioSpace last month. Careful titration or dose adjustments, updated or combination formulations, and drugs targeting side effects are all strategies being deployed to improve the palatability of GLP-1s.\n\nFor David Cummings, director of the weight management program for VA Puget Sound Health Care System, side effects are less of a deciding factor. \u201cFor my patients, [the gastrointestinal side effects] are not a huge deal, but it\u2019s not a trivial deal either,\u201d he told BioSpace.\n\nTitration, Combinations and Secondary Drugs\n\nSide effects like nausea and constipation are \u201ceasy to understand\u201d as they relate to the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, Cummings explained. One of the ways in which GLP-1s make patients feel full is by slowing GI motility. If the drug has too great an effect in the upper GI system, it can cause nausea, as happens when eating a huge meal too fast. If the drug has too strong an effect in the lower intestine, slow GI motility leads to constipation, he said.\n\n\u201cIn both cases, that\u2019s just the drug doing what it\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d and the proper response is to decrease the dose to a level that is still efficacious but with fewer side effects, Cummings said. Interestingly, he said researchers are uncertain why diarrhea occurs with GLP-1 treatment.\n\nA key strategy being deployed by drug developers to improve side effect profiles is titration. The starting dose and length of time to maintenance dose are critical to optimizing patient tolerability, Blai Coll, chief medical officer of Structure Therapeutics, told BioSpace.\n\nAnother popular approach is combination formulas. The addition of a gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)\u2014such as in Zepbound\u2019s formulation\u2014or an amylin receptor agonist can mitigate the gastrointestinal effects driven by the GLP-1, Coll said.\n\nAmylin has become a hot mechanism for weight loss drug developers as companies like Novo, Structure, AstraZeneca and Viking Therapeutics chase after approval of their candidates.\n\nStill other companies aim to target GLP-1-associated side effects with a separate, secondary drug.\n\nIn January, Jaguar Health subsidiary Napo Pharmaceuticals filed a patent application for Mytesi to treat the GI side effects common with GLP-1 and GIP treatments used for obesity.\n\nMytesi is a plant-based oral drug already approved for HIV-related diarrhea that has shown additional benefits for abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating and constipation when studied in HIV, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and cancer therapy-related diarrhea.\n\nWhile Cummings isn\u2019t familiar with Mytesi in particular, he said that if the drug truly helped to treat GLP-1 side effects, \u201cI\u2019d certainly consider using it.\u201d\n\nBen Urick, senior director of health outcomes at Prime Therapeutics, isn\u2019t convinced, however. He told BioSpace that the clinical goal is usually to instead find an alternative treatment with less burdensome side effects.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to really convince me that we would need another drug,\u201d said Urick, a pharmacist. For a patient with dire disease circumstances and no other option, it may be useful, he added, \u201cbut not for your average user.\u201d\n\nGLP-1 Discontinuation Is Multifactorial\n\nDespite these extensive efforts, the jury is still out on just how much of a problem GLP-1\u2013associated side effects are. Cummings noted that only about 5% of his patients on GLP-1 medications have really had problems with side effects.\n\nA series of real-world studies mirror this assertion, with a 5% discontinuation rate found for patients taking semaglutide over roughly 30 weeks due to adverse events.\n\nAnother real-world study, published in July 2024 by Prime Therapeutics, showed that 85% of patients were no longer taking GLP-1 drugs two years after starting treatment. But this isn\u2019t only due to tolerability concerns. Urick said discontinuation can be attributed to five common causes, of which side effects are only one, along with affordability, availability, physician drug switches and the achievement of weight loss goals.\n\nHowever, \u201cI don\u2019t think shortages have quite as big of an impact as you would think,\u201d Urick said, adding that patients on lower doses of the drugs are more likely to be affected.\n\nDespite literature touting GLP-1s as long-term treatments, prescribers have indicated to Urick that patients often only use the drugs to reach certain weight loss goals and then discontinue treatment once these are accomplished. Another indicator of this phenomenon is that in Prime\u2019s study, patients without type 2 diabetes discontinued treatment at a higher rate than those with the disease.\n\nUrick also noted that Prime\u2019s study data was initiated in 2021 and included older products that are no longer used as often, causing the treatment persistence rate to drop to 15%. With a \u201cmore modern product mix\u201d led by heavy hitters like Zepbound and Wegovy, Urick said he expects to see two-year persistence rise to closer to 25%.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that side effects are not an issue for patients. In fact, Urick believes the role of side effects and achieved weight loss goals have been underestimated in efforts to uncover the cause of GLP-1 discontinuation. While this study wasn\u2019t designed to measure it, a further probe into Prime\u2019s data revealed those who persisted on treatment had lower side effect rates than those who discontinued their GLP-1. For Urick, this is a signal that side effects could be associated with stopping a drug early. \u201cThere is a relationship between the two,\u201d he said.\n\nUltimately, Coll said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a silver bullet by which we can continue benefiting from the GLP-1s while completely eliminating all the GI events.\u201d He reiterated an emphasis on combination therapies with GIP and amylin to optimize tolerability. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re looking into the future.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cThis study we presented here for the first time is just dedicated to adolescents. It is the largest study of a JAK inhibitor dedicated to adolescents with severe alopecia areata,\u201d said Anabela Cardoso, MD, in an interview at the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\nCardoso, the senior vice president of immunology medical affairs at Eli Lilly and Company, discussed pivotal findings on baricitinib (Olumiant; Lilly/Incyte) for adolescents with severe alopecia areata during an AAD late-breaker session. The data demonstrated that adolescent patients (aged 12 to 18 years) with severe alopecia areata treated with once-daily, oral baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg saw clinically meaningful improvements in hair regrowth on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes at week 36.1,2\n\nThe primary end point of the study was a Severity of Alopecia Tool score \u226420 (80% or more scalp hair coverage) at week 36. At the start of the study, patients had an average of 89% scalp hair loss (near total hair loss), 65% had minimal or no eyebrow hair (clinician-reported outcome [ClinRO] score of 2 or 3), and 57% had minimal or no eyelash hair (ClinRO score of 2 or 3).2\n\nAlopecia areata affects both adults and adolescents, with approximately 40% of cases beginning before age 20. Early-onset disease carries a significant psychosocial burden, impacting self-esteem, social interactions, and mental health, making effective treatment crucial for this high unmet need population.\n\nThe phase 3 BRAVE-AA-PEDS trial was a dedicated adolescent study on baricitinib, the largest JAK inhibitor study for this population, and enrolled 250 patients with severe alopecia areata, many of whom had complete or near-complete scalp hair loss. Compared to adults, adolescents presented with more severe disease, yet baricitinib demonstrated faster efficacy in this group. At 36 weeks, approximately 60% of patients achieved \u226550% hair regrowth, a milestone that took one year in adults, highlighting potentially accelerated responsiveness in younger patients.\n\nAccording to Cardoso, safety considerations were a key focus, given baricitinib\u2019s status as a JAK inhibitor. The study\u2019s safety profile was consistent with adult trials, reinforcing its potential as a well-tolerated option for adolescents. Cardoso noted baricitinib has been studied in over 800 patients aged 18 years, including those as young as 2 years old, and in more than 14,000 adults across various immune-mediated diseases.\n\nThe latest data shows baricitinib\u2019s potential to fill a critical treatment gap for adolescents with severe alopecia areata, offering faster and effective hair regrowth with a well-established safety profile.\n\nFor all news from AAD, click here.\n\nReferences",

Image: Adobe Stock.\n\nBaricitinib (Olumiant, Eli Lilly) is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is approved for adults with severe alopecia areata, Thierry Passeron, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the department of dermatology at the Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur in Nice, France, said during the presentation.\n\nIn June 2023, the FDA approved ritlecitinib (Litfulo, Pfizer) for participants with severe alopecia aged 12 years and older, but \u201cthere is still a very important medical need\u201d for more options in children and adolescents, Passeron said.\n\nPasseron and colleagues randomly assigned 257 participants aged 12 to younger than 18 years with severe alopecia areata in a 1:1:1 ratio to 2 mg baricitinib daily, 4 mg baricitinib daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 20 or below at 36 weeks, representing 80% or more scalp hair coverage.\n\nAt baseline, the mean SALT score was approximately 90% across the treatment groups, indicating \u201cvery severe populations,\u201d Passeron said. About 60% of participants were white, one-fourth were Asian, and 6% to 9% were Black or African American. All the participants previously experienced treatment failure with at least one prior therapy.\n\nAccording to the results, 42.4% of participants in the 4 mg baricitinib group and 27.4% in the 2 mg group achieved the primary endpoint vs. 4.5% of participants in the placebo group. The researchers observed a significant difference between the baricitinib and placebo groups by week 12, Passeron said.\n\nFurther, at week 36, the researchers found that 36.5% of participants in the 4 mg baricitinib group and 21.4% in the 2 mg group had a SALT score of 10 or below vs. 2.3% in the placebo group.\n\nOverall, 60% of participants in the 4 mg baricitinib group and 36.9% in the 2 mg group had a 50% or greater improvement in SALT scores compared with 5.7% in the placebo group. Additionally, 32.9% in the 4 mg group and 20.2% in the 2 mg group had a 90% or greater improvement vs. 1.1% in the placebo group.\n\nBaricitinib was also linked to higher rates of eyebrow regrowth at week 36, which was 50% in the 4 mg group and 24.1% in the 2 mg group vs. 0% in the placebo group, as well as eyelash regrowth, which was 42.9% in the 4 mg group and 25.5% in the 2 mg group vs. 14% in the placebo group.\n\nThe safety profile of baricitinib was consistent with clinical trials of adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, according to an Eli Lilly press release. Only one serious adverse event occurred in the baricitinib arms, which was a case of noncomplicated appendicitis in the 4 mg group, Passeron said. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included acne, headache, upper respiratory infection, rhinitis, nasopharyngitis and influenza.\n\n\u201cThere is no new safety signal,\u201d Passeron said.\n\nThe BRAVE-AA-PEDS study is ongoing, with additional analyses including children aged 6 to 11 years, according to the press release.",

AstraZeneca\u2019s main research and development areas include oncology, rare diseases, and biopharmaceutical intervention, and it has numerous ongoing projects. Global company headquarters are located in Cambridge, England, and it has more than 80,000 employees in more than 60 countries worldwide.\n\nHistory and the 1999 merger AstraZeneca was founded in 1999 when the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB merged with U.K.\u2013based pharmaceutical company Zeneca Group. At the time, it represented one of the largest mergers to ever occur between two European companies. Astra AB dated back to 1913 and had established itself as a leading domestic pharmaceutical manufacturer in Sweden. The company\u2019s first blockbuster drug was Xylocaine (lidocaine), a numbing agent that quickly gained popularity in the United States after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 1950s. Zeneca Group was founded in 1993 in Britain and maintained a major share of the oncology care market in both the U.K. and the U.S. The company\u2019s main specialties were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory drugs, as well as those relating to oncology and anesthesia. Early 2020s: Product diversification and a failed acquisition\n\nOpen full sized image The numbing drug that put Astra AB on the map. \u00a9 Science & Society Picture Library/Getty Images\n\nSome of AstraZeneca\u2019s most widely prescribed medicines in the 21st century include: Tagrisso (osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer\n\n(osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer Farxiga (dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure\n\n(dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure Crestor (rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol\n\n(rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AstraZeneca also manufactures the popular proton-pump inhibitor drugs Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) and Prilosec (omeprazole magnesium), which are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 2012 AstraZeneca became a founding member, with nine other pharmaceutical companies, of the nonprofit TransCelerate BioPharma Inc. The organization\u2019s mission is to improve access to information that helps facilitate the creation of new medicines. Some recent efforts have centered on refining methods to digitally share clinical trial information. Pfizer, Inc., another of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, attempted to acquire AstraZeneca in 2014. The acquisition would have resulted in the creation of the world\u2019s largest drug company. However, the deal garnered much criticism in Britain, primarily because of alleged tax breaks and job cuts that would have resulted from the merger. AstraZeneca ultimately declined the sale on the grounds that its profitability potential was greater than the price offered by Pfizer. COVID-19 vaccine and controversy AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was created by the University of Oxford. The Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was a double-stranded DNA-based vaccine, as opposed to the popular Moderna and Pfizer offerings, which were based on single-stranded RNA. Commonly known by the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine received high efficacy ratings and proved easier to store than most competitors\u2019 vaccines, which often required storage in below-freezing temperatures. Demand outpaced supply, and the European Union registered complaints that AstraZeneca had failed to deliver millions of promised doses in early 2021.\n\nOpen full sized image Should employers be able to mandate vaccinations? \u00a9 Scaliger/Dreamstime.com",

            "content": "China has the world's highest incidence of the disease. The rush is on to bring new diagnostics, like blood-based biomarker testing, to relieve the suffering.\n\nInvestors and business leaders are closely watching sales figures as Japanese and US breakthrough drugs for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's go head to head this year in China, which has the world's largest incidence of the disease. The rivalry pits US-based Eli Lilly, which obtained Chinese regulatory for its Kisunla drug late last year, against Eisai's Leqembi, approved a year earlier. Kisunla is a treatment for early symptoms of the disease; Lequmbi is the world's first approved \"disease-modifying drug\" for Alzheimer's. China has an aging population, with an estimated 9.8 million people 60 years or older who are afflicted with Alzheimer's. That number is expected to reach 28 million by 2050. The disease not only diminishes the mental capacity of patients but also causes great sorrow and a sense of helplessness among family members. At the moment, Leqembi is priced at 2,508 yuan (US$456) per vial, and roughly 200,000 yuan for a full-year treatment. Kisunla is expected to be similarly priced when it hits the market this month. If the market penetration of these drugs reaches 3 percent of Alzheimer's patients, it would position China's market for the disease therapeutics at 60 billion yuan a year. And that doesn't even include the more lucrative market of \"mild-cognitive impairment\" drugs, which treat Alzheimer's at stage when people who retain independent living capabilities start to show symptoms of near-term memory loss.\n\nImaginechina\n\nPopulation at risk China is estimated to have some 39 million people in the mild-cognitive-impairment category, according to the nation's last dementia epidemiological survey in 2020. To differentiate Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia, caused, say by Parkinson's or cardiovascular diseases, patients must be given a biomarker test of amyloid-beta or tau \u2013 the two hallmark biomarkers. What does the arrival of Leqembi and Kisunla portend for the market in advanced therapeutics? Typically, the approval of innovative medicines with new treatment pathways triggers growth in diagnostic demand. For example, the launch of Keytruda, the world's best-selling prescription cancer treatment, fueled the growth of testing with a protein called PD-1, creating a new testing market globally. The approval of Leqembi and Kisunla, along with other disease-modifying drugs, will inevitably boost the adoption of Alzheimer's biomarker testing. Last year was a turning point for blood-based biomarker development. Significant clinical guidelines for biomarkers have been released by leading physician groups, and a number of leading international and domestic players in the industry are using different business models to gain a foothold in what promises to be a lucrative market.\n\nReuters\n\nReuters\n\nUpdated progress report A leading organization called Alzheimer's Association Workgroup had its \"Revised Criteria for Diagnosis and Staging of Alzheimer's Disease\" published in the industry journal Alzheimer's & Dementia in April 2024. This group said three major developments prompted the update. First, treatments that target core disease pathology have, for the first time, received regulatory approval, with the prospect of these therapies entering clinical practice. Second, the most significant advance in recent year in diagnostics for the disease has been the development of blood-based biomarkers, with some, but not all, showing accurate diagnosis. They are another tool to integrate with traditional biomarkers such as \"positron emission tomography\" and \"cerebrospinal fluid assays.\" And finally, the group noted important research showing that imaging, assays and blood-based biomarkers are interchangeable in some, though not all, cases. This revised criteria for Alzheimer's diagnosis seems to remove some of the roadblocks for physicians hesitant to use blood-based biomarkers. That potentially reduces cost and hospital stays for diagnosis. \"Positron emission tomography,\" or PET scans, are priced at about US$10,000 in the US and US$1,000 in China, while \"cerebrospinal fluid assays\" require a 4-5 hour hospital procedure that can have side effects. On the commercial side, the market for Alzheimer's blood-based biomarkers is swiftly gathering steam, with a series of major research results released in leading publications and leading players jumping on the bandwagon.\n\nFlurry of global industry moves In January 2024, ALZpath published research results of \"pTau217\" in JAMA Neurology, a medical journal published by the American Medical Association. It claimed its blood-based biomarker performed on the Simoa platform on a par with the golden standard of \"cerebrospinal fluid assays.\" Quanterix, a leading US-based diagnostic technology company, partnered with Chinese startup UltraDx in 2023 to commercialize its Simoa-technology testing solutions in China. In 2020, US-based C2N Diagnostics launched its first \"amyloid-beta\" test with a price of US$1,250. Last year, Japan's Eisai invested US$15 million into C2N to streamline its early diagnosis process. Roche Diagnostics partnered with Eli Lilly to develop the Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel to test biomarker pTau181 and ApoE4, a specific gene associated with a specific group of Alzheimer's patients. Last July, ALZpath signed a licensing agreement with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics to integrate its proprietary antibody into a blood-based diagnostic for Alzheimer's, and in December, Eisai entered into a memorandum of understanding with Tokyo-based Fujirebio Holdings Inc. for the joint research on novel blood-based biomarkers. But these international players clearly haven't yet found a feasible path forward in China.\n\nHigh standards To succeed in China's diagnostic market requires clinically acceptable quality of more than 90 percent sensitivity and specificity, access with either in-hospital testing or out-of-hospital laboratory development testing, and affordability for patients. The standards may be high but the potential is vast. The market for Alzheimer's blood-based biomarkers is estimated to reach 33.2 billion yuan by 2030, according to a report by Founder Securities published in May.\n\nImaginechina\n\nThe market is currently fraught with products of less than 90 percent optimal sensitivity and specificity. Out of the more than 50 China-approved projects, only a few met that requirement, meaning that physicians will not risk patient health or their own professional reputations by using a diagnosis product that doesn't meet standards. Access is a make-it-or-break-it factor. If a company boasting a premium technology platform can't install its machines in hospital's testing centers, it won't generate projected sales targets. Quanterix's Simoa-based, blood-based biomarker product is one example. Its tests show very high sensitivity and specificity, and the company is well-respected in the research community. However, one testing machine is priced at about 3 million yuan, coming up against Chinese public hospitals under pressure to control costs. With Alzheimer's blood-based biomarkers not included in the country's national pharmaceutical reimbursement list, the cost remains high for patients. All these factors don't at the moment bode well for the commercial outlook of advanced therapeutics.\n\nSearch for cheaper costs Astrabio, a Suzhou-based biotech company, and Nanjing-based Vazyme, which went public in 2021 on the Shanghai stock market, are pursuing ways to ease commercialization of diagnostic solutions. Astrabio has produced China's first proprietary, single-molecule immune detection platform, claiming it matches the performance of systems developed by players such as Quanterix, but at more reasonable prices. The company has successfully installed its testing machines in Shanghai Huashan Hospital and Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, two of the top three national neuroscience medical centers in China. The company also has aggressive plans to its machines in more than 100 hospitals this year. Astrabio is also actively expanding its footprint in overseas markets, with a recent partnership deal signed in Thailand. Blood-based biomarker development has become a leading area of research and bio investment funding the past two years. However, for an uncharted market like Alzheimer's to really take off, pure scientific advancement is not enough. A sound ecosystem must be established to increase disease awareness and testing at early stages. All too often, patients beginning to show signs of mental deterioration simply write memory loss off as a normal part of aging and don't seek medical advice. Encouraging news came in January, when 15 central government ministries, led by National Health Commission, enacted the 2024-30 National Action Plan for Coping with Dementia. It urges that public awareness of dementia be elevated to 80 percent of the population and that cognitive screening of the at-risk population reach four of five people. Treatment rates are recommended to reach a minimum 50 percent by 2030. It's obvious that the China market for a multibillion-dollar market in Alzheimer's diagnosis is at a tipping point, and more accessible, affordable solutions are just around the corner.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Commented On These 6 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer commented discussed recently.\n\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the recent turbulence in the stock market, pointing to the lack of clarity from the White House as a major contributor to the decline.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has put himself in the awkward position of predicting pain and he\u2019s delivering it to owners of stocks in a way that doesn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer and Analysts Like These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer Looked At These 11 Stocks Recently\n\nHe emphasized that the current environment is defined by extreme uncertainty, which is impacting the market and business sentiment. Cramer\u2019s first point centered around the lack of clarity, which he described as one of the biggest challenges facing the market. He warned that business activity would slow down, and hiring in the U.S. could be severely impacted unless clearer signals from the White House are provided.\n\nCramer predicted that the non-farm payroll report coming tomorrow would likely show weak numbers, marking the beginning of a series of disappointing economic reports. He pointed out that while most businesses oppose the tariffs, what truly worries them is the unpredictability of future actions from the administration.\n\nMoving to his second point, Cramer highlighted the president\u2019s continued threats to impose more tariffs. He stated that the uncertain timeline of these tariff hikes is creating significant anxiety in the business community. Cramer\u2019s third point addressed the widespread caution in corporate earnings forecasts.\n\nHe explained that nearly every company reporting earnings during this period has been adopting a cautious outlook, even if their financial performance is strong. This cautious tone, according to Cramer, is largely driven by the fear and uncertainty surrounding the administration\u2019s economic policies. Moving on to the fourth point, Cramer said:\n\n\u201cIf we want the consumer who has enough money to keep spending, we need to maintain some degree of wealth effect. It\u2019s not a subsidy, it\u2019s capitalism. I think the consumer\u2019s baffled by the president\u2019s tariff policy.\u201d\n\nIn his fifth point, Cramer warned that, in the current climate, saving might not be enough to sustain the economy. He emphasized that no one wants to be caught off guard, and the current environment is ideal for short sellers. Cramer pointed out that in such a volatile and uncertain market, companies are reluctant to go public, as they fear that the negative sentiment could hurt their valuation.",

The goal of this shift in representation is to reduce public stigma of a variety of conditions.\n\nDespite millions of Americans dealing with diseases, the study found a lack of presence of these health conditions in content. When they do show up, there are mis-portrayals which often do not reflect the true patient experience.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOnly 2.8% of speaking characters across 2023\u2019s most popular TV shows and films had obesity, despite 37% of the U.S. population living with obesity, the study found. Of the characters with obesity, nearly half (46.2%) were depicted as \u201cbeing unlikable,\u201d and they were rarely shown in multidimensional roles. Only 4.6% held high-status jobs (neurosurgeon, Chief of Police, etc.), while 18.4% were portrayed as unemployed. Cancer portrayals focus on the fear and sadness, often overlooking real-world survival rates and advancements.\n\nLilly, which is represented by UTA\u2019s Entertainment Marketing Division, will be informed on how to take action based on the study\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cAt Imagine Entertainment, we\u2019re committed to telling stories that reflect the full spectrum of the human experience, and the results of Dr. Smith\u2019s USC Annenberg study are illuminating and will help inform us as we work to increase representation of real, varied health conditions on-screen in the film and television industry,\u201d said Imagine\u2019s EVP of Business and Brand Development Amanda Farrand.\n\n\u201cInclusive storytelling is at the heart of MACRO,\u201d said Chief Brand Officer Stacey Walker King. \u201cWe champion all underrepresented voices and are excited to help change the narrative around disease in media, ensuring people of color see their experiences reflected with truth and dignity.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

            "content": "It's often challenging to decide which stocks to invest in. However, some companies look too attractive to pass up. We asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick slam-dunk growth stocks investors can confidently add to their portfolios. They chose three famous drugmakers: Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%), Amgen (AMGN 0.04%), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 1.51%). Read on to discover why.\n\nOne of the top growth stocks in the industry\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): What's considered excellent revenue growth depends on the industry. For pharmaceutical companies, especially those with a market cap above $50 billion, year-over-year top-line increases in the high-single-digit percentages are already pretty strong. With that context in mind, consider that Eli Lilly's revenue growth has not dipped below 20% since mid-2023.\n\nThe company is firing on all cylinders, largely thanks to its work in the diabetes and obesity markets. Eli Lilly's medicines, such as Mounjaro and Zepbound, are racking up incredible sales, and they are still on an upward path. Further, other recent launches should soon contribute to the drugmaker's results, which will help it deal with the mounting competition in its core area of expertise. Perhaps Eli Lilly's most promising recent approval is Kisunla, an Alzheimer's disease treatment.\n\nDespite an aging population, few medicines in this field have earned the green light from regulators in the past two decades. So, there is a vast unmet need here. Enter Kisunla, which should easily crack blockbuster status at its peak. But that's not all. From Eli Lilly's other recent launches, such as cancer medicine Jaypirca, to exciting pipeline candidates like Retatrutide -- a potential next-gen anti-obesity medicine -- not to mention a steady and growing dividend, Eli Lilly has much to offer growth and income-oriented investors.\n\nThe company remains a strong buy despite not performing in line with the market in the past six months.\n\nA big biotech company with multiple growth opportunities\n\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't just have one path to growth. This big biotech company has multiple growth opportunities. And those opportunities are big ones.\n\nVertex achieved tremendous success with its cystic fibrosis (CF) therapies. The company still has plenty of room to grow in the CF market, especially with its recently approved drug Alyftrek. Not only is Alyftrek more effective than Vertex's top-selling Trikafta, but it also has a more convenient once-daily dosing. In addition, Vertex's royalty burden is lower with Alyftrek than with its older CF therapies.\n\nGene-editing therapy Casgevy has been approved for over a year in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Sure, it only generated revenue of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, Vertex still thinks Casgevy has multibillion-dollar potential as its commercial launch ramps up.\n\nI'm especially optimistic about the prospects for Vertex's new pain drug Journavx. Its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January 2025 marked the first U.S. approval of a non-opioid pain therapy in more than 20 years. I predict Journavx will become a blockbuster drug sooner than Casgevy.\n\nVertex's growth prospects look even better when we factor in its late-stage pipeline programs. The company hopes to win another indication for Journavx in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It has two candidates in phase 3 testing targeting kidney diseases: inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease and povetacicept for IgA nephropathy. Vertex could even cure severe type 1 diabetes with zimislecel.\n\nMagnificent growth stock? I think Vertex Pharmaceuticals is definitely worthy of the description.\n\nAmgen is a top growth stock with a lot of potential in the GLP-1 market\n\nDavid Jagielski (Amgen): One pharma stock that hasn't gotten much love of late is Amgen. Although it's a beast in the healthcare industry, with a market cap of more than $165 billion, investors may be overlooking the potential upside it possesses, specifically in the GLP-1 weight loss market.\n\nInvestors dumped the stock late last year because its once-per-month injection, MariTide, fell short of analyst expectations as it helped people lose only 20% weight in a phase 2 trial -- analysts were expecting 25%. However, the silver lining is that there was no plateau and some people in the clinical trial took it less frequently than once per month; it's possible that greater weight loss may be attainable with the treatment.\n\nA stock with a promising GLP-1 treatment can sometimes trade at a premium, and yet, for Amgen, it's trading at just 15 times next year's estimated earnings (based on analyst projections), making it a potential bargain buy. That's not a bad deal for a stock which also pays a dividend that yields more than 3% and which grew its top line by 19% in 2024, to $33.4 billion.\n\nThe company has been growing its business via acquisitions in recent years and with a promising pipeline which features dozens of phase 3 trials, this makes for a potentially underrated growth stock to hang on to for the long haul.",

The study, presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, revealed that 42.4% of adolescents receiving a 4 mg dose of baricitinib achieved 80% or more scalp hair coverage at Week 36. The findings highlight the potential of baricitinib as an effective treatment for young patients suffering from this chronic immune system disorder.\n\nPositive Aspects\n\n42.4% of adolescents achieved 80% or more scalp hair coverage with baricitinib 4 mg.\n\nSignificant regrowth of eyebrows and eyelashes was observed in patients treated with baricitinib.\n\nBaricitinib demonstrated a faster rate of hair regrowth in adolescents compared to adults.\n\nThe safety profile of baricitinib in adolescents was consistent with previous trials.\n\nNegative Aspects\n\nCommon adverse events included acne, influenza, and upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nSerious adverse events were more frequent in the placebo group, but still present in baricitinib groups.\n\nPotential risks associated with baricitinib include serious infections, malignancies, and cardiovascular events.\n\nFinancial Analyst Perspective\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the positive results from the BRAVE-AA-PEDS study could bolster Eli Lilly's market position in the dermatology sector. The promising data on baricitinib's efficacy in adolescents may lead to increased demand and potential regulatory approvals, expanding its market reach. However, investors should remain cautious of the associated risks and adverse events, which could impact the drug's commercial success and Eli Lilly's financial performance.\n\nMarket Research Analyst Perspective\n\nThe successful results of baricitinib in treating severe alopecia areata in adolescents present a significant opportunity for Eli Lilly to capture a niche market segment. With a growing focus on personalized medicine and targeted therapies, baricitinib's efficacy in younger patients could differentiate it from competitors. The study's findings may also influence treatment guidelines and increase awareness of alopecia areata, potentially driving market growth in the dermatology field.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the main finding of the BRAVE-AA-PEDS study?\n\nThe study found that 42.4% of adolescents receiving baricitinib 4 mg achieved 80% or more scalp hair coverage at Week 36.\n\nWhat are the common adverse events associated with baricitinib?\n\nCommon adverse events include acne, influenza, and upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nHow does baricitinib's efficacy in adolescents compare to adults?\n\nAdolescents showed a faster rate of hair regrowth compared to adults, with comparable results achieved in a shorter timeframe.\n\nWhat are the potential risks of using baricitinib?\n\nPotential risks include serious infections, malignancies, and major adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nRead the original press release here.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The primary endpoint of this study was a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score \u226420 (i.e., 80% or more scalp hair coverage) at Week 36. At the start of the study, patients had an average of 89% scalp hair loss (near total hair loss), 65% had minimal or no eyebrow hair (clinician-reported outcome [ClinRO] score of 2 or 3) and 57% had minimal or no eyelash hair (ClinRO score of 2 or 3). 1\n\n\"Early onset alopecia areata can be more severe, leading to extensive hair loss that frequently does not improve with topicals or corticosteroids often prescribed as first-line therapy,\" said Brittany Craiglow, M.D., Adjunct Associate Professor of Dermatology, Yale School of Medicine. \"These initial results are exciting because they demonstrate that baricitinib can provide significant hair regrowth for adolescents at 36 weeks, a promising early signal of baricitinib's potential as an effective treatment for adolescents with severe disease.\"\n\nAA is an immune system condition that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face and sometimes on other areas of the body that can progress over time. Approximately 40% of patients with AA experience first onset by 20 years of age. 2\n\nINDIANAPOLIS, March 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Late-breaking results from Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) found adolescent patients (ages 12 to under 18) with severe alopecia areata (AA) treated with once-daily, oral baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg saw clinically meaningful improvements in hair regrowth on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes at Week 36. Findings from the Phase 3 BRAVE-AA-PEDS study were presented in a late-breaker presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting taking place March 7-11 in Orlando. 1\n\nPositive data underscore Lilly's continued expansion across dermatologic conditions, with treatments that can improve outcomes for patients with the greatest need\n\nStory Continues\n\nResults achieved by adolescents at 36 weeks were comparable to results achieved by adults after 52 weeks of treatment, suggesting that hair regrowth may be faster in adolescents compared to adults.1 In the BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 studies, 40.9% of adult patients treated with baricitinib 4 mg and 21.2% of patients treated with baricitinib 2 mg achieved 80% or more scalp hair coverage at Week 52.3\n\n\"With these data, baricitinib is the most well-studied JAK inhibitor in severe alopecia areata, a chronic immune system disorder that can have an especially devastating social and emotional impact on adolescent patients and their families,\" said Anabela Cardoso, senior vice president, Lilly Immunology Medical Affairs. \"We are excited about these initial results, which show baricitinib can provide significant scalp hair regrowth in adolescents, potentially at an even faster rate compared to adults. We look forward to sharing longer-term data results at upcoming congresses and discussing findings with global regulators in the months ahead.\"\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events in BRAVE-AA-PEDS included acne, influenza and upper respiratory tract infection. A higher frequency of serious adverse events was seen in the placebo group compared to baricitinib groups. No deaths, opportunistic infections, major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolic events or malignancies were reported in the trial.1\n\nThe safety profile of baricitinib in adolescents with AA was consistent with the safety profile seen in clinical trials for adolescent patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Over 14,600 patients have received baricitinib in clinical trials; of these, 866 have been patients between the ages of >1 month to <18 years.\n\nLilly will present additional data from the BRAVE-AA-PEDS study at scientific meetings later this year and submit the results for peer-reviewed publication. Baricitinib is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly. In 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved baricitinib (commercially available as Olumiant) for adult patients with severe AA, making it the first systemic treatment approved in the U.S. for severe disease.\n\nBaricitinib is also approved in the U.S. and more than 75 countries as a treatment for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, in more than 40 countries for the treatment of patients down to the age of two with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy and in Europe and Japan for adult patients with severe AA. Marketing authorization for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been granted for baricitinib in multiple countries.\n\nAbout BRAVE-AA-PEDS Study\n\nBRAVE-AA-PEDS (NCT05723198) is an ongoing, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial involving children ages 6 to under 18 years with severe AA, as measured by a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of \u226550 (i.e., who had \u2265 50% scalp hair loss) and a current episode of severe AA lasting at least six months but no more than eight years. Adolescent participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-daily placebo, baricitinib 4 mg or baricitinib 2 mg. The first cohort of patients enrolled included adolescents (ages 12 to under 18 years, weighing \u2265 30 kg). The next cohort of children ages 6 to under 12 will begin enrollment in the next year. An additional cohort of adolescents were randomized 1:1 to baricitinib 4 mg or baricitinib 2 mg.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR OLUMIANT (BARICITINIB) TABLETS\n\nWARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS, MORTALITY, MALIGNANCY, MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, AND THROMBOSIS\n\nSERIOUS INFECTIONS\n\nPatients treated with Olumiant are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. If a serious infection develops, interrupt Olumiant until the infection is controlled. Reported infections include:\n\nActive tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Olumiant should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Test patients, except those with COVID-19, for latent TB before initiating Olumiant and during therapy. If positive, start treatment for latent infection prior to Olumiant use.\n\nInvasive fungal infections, including candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.\n\nBacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.\n\nCarefully consider the risks and benefits of Olumiant prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.\n\nClosely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Olumiant including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.\n\nThe most common serious infections reported with Olumiant included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with Olumiant. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.\n\nAvoid use of Olumiant in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Olumiant in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.\n\nThe risks and benefits of treatment with Olumiant in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered.\n\nConsider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Olumiant in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection.\n\nViral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with Olumiant. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt Olumiant treatment until the episode resolves. The impact of Olumiant on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Screen for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before initiating Olumiant.\n\nMORTALITY\n\nIn a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor.\n\nConsider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant.\n\nMALIGNANCIES\n\nLymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients treated with Olumiant. In RA patients treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers and an additional increased risk of overall malignancies were observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers.\n\nConsider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.\n\nNMSCs have been reported in patients treated with Olumiant. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.\n\nMAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS\n\nIn RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue Olumiant in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\nConsider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Olumiant, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.\n\nTHROMBOSIS\n\nThrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with another JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid Olumiant in patients at risk. Discontinue Olumiant and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis.\n\nHYPERSENSITIVITY\n\nReactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving Olumiant, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue Olumiant while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction.\n\nGASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS\n\nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported in Olumiant clinical studies. Monitor Olumiant-treated patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Promptly evaluate patients who present with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.\n\nLABORATORY ABNORMALITIES\n\nNeutropenia \u2013 Olumiant treatment was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.\n\nIn patients with RA or alopecia areata (AA), avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <1000 cells/mm3. In patients with COVID-19, avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ANC <500 cells/mm3.\n\nLymphopenia \u2013 Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <500 cells/mm3 were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with Olumiant, but not placebo. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management.\n\nIn patients with RA or AA, avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <500 cells/mm3. In patients with COVID-19, avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with an ALC <200 cells/mm3.\n\nAnemia \u2013 Decreases in hemoglobin levels to <8 g/dL were reported in Olumiant clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. In patients with RA or AA, avoid initiation or interrupt Olumiant treatment in patients with hemoglobin <8 g/dL. In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of Olumiant in patients with hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL.\n\nLiver Enzyme Elevations \u2013 Olumiant treatment was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of alanine transaminase (ALT) \u22655x upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of aspartate transaminase (AST) \u226510x ULN were observed in patients in Olumiant clinical trials.\n\nEvaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Promptly investigate the cause of liver enzyme elevation to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt Olumiant until this diagnosis is excluded.\n\nLipid Elevations \u2013 Treatment with Olumiant was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks following Olumiant initiation in patients with RA or AA. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.\n\nVACCINATIONS\n\nAvoid use of live vaccines with Olumiant. Update immunizations in patients with RA or AA prior to initiating Olumiant therapy in agreement with current immunization guidelines.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn RA trials, the most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) reported with Olumiant were: upper respiratory tract infections, nausea, herpes simplex, and herpes zoster.\n\nIn COVID-19 trials, the most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) reported with Olumiant were: ALT \u22653x ULN, AST \u22653x ULN, thrombocytosis (platelets >600,000 cells/mm3), creatine phosphokinase >5x ULN, neutropenia (ANC <1000 cells/mm3), DVT, PE, and urinary tract infection.\n\nIn AA trials, the most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) reported with Olumiant were: upper respiratory tract infections, headache, acne, hyperlipidemia, creatine phosphokinase increase, urinary tract infections, liver enzyme elevations, folliculitis, fatigue, lower respiratory tract infections, nausea, genital Candida infections, anemia, neutropenia, abdominal pain, herpes zoster, and weight increase.\n\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION\n\nBased on animal studies, Olumiant may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise pregnant women and women of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for women of reproductive potential. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Olumiant and for 4 days after the last dose.\n\nHEPATIC AND RENAL IMPAIRMENT\n\nOlumiant is not recommended in patients with RA or AA and severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min/1.73m2).\n\nOlumiant should only be used in patients with COVID-19 and severe hepatic impairment if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Olumiant is not recommended in patients with COVID-19 who are on dialysis, have end-stage renal disease, or with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2.\n\nPlease click to access full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning about Serious Infections, Mortality, Malignancy, Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, and Thrombosis, and Medication Guide.\n\nBA HCP ISI ALL 13JUN2022\n\nAbout Olumiant\n\nOlumiant, a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor, was discovered by Incyte and licensed to Lilly.

These findings from the ADjoin long-term extension study will be presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, taking place March 7-11 in Orlando .1\n\nEBGLYSS is an interleukin-13 (IL-13) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-13 signaling with high binding affinity.2,3,4 The cytokine IL-13 is a primary cytokine in atopic dermatitis, driving the type-2 inflammatory cycle in the skin, leading to skin barrier dysfunction, itch, skin thickening and infection.5,6\n\nThree-year depth of response data being presented are part of ADjoin, the long-term extension study of the EBGLYSS trials, and include participants who responded to EBGLYSS treatment at Week 16 from ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2 monotherapy trials. Patients received a maintenance dose of 250 mg EBGLYSS either every two weeks or once monthly (every four weeks) and were assessed for depth of response using IGA 0, EASI 90 and EASI 100.*1 The approved maintenance dose of EBGLYSS is 250 mg once monthly, after taking EBGLYSS every two weeks for the four-month initial dosing phase (or later once achieving adequate clinical response).7\n\nOf the patients who responded to treatment at Week 16 and were receiving once-monthly maintenance dosing, 50% of patients achieved complete skin clearance ( EASI 100 or IGA 0) at three years. Additionally, 87% achieved or maintained almost-clear skin ( EASI 90) at three years.1\n\nOver 83% of Week 16 responders taking EBGLYSS did not require the use of concomitant therapies such as topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) for the duration of the ADjoin study.1\n\n\"Healthcare providers are constantly searching for ways to help patients achieve deep, sustainable improvement in the signs and symptoms of their atopic dermatitis,\" said Raj Chovatiya, M.D., Ph.D., MSCI, Clinical Associate Professor, Rosalind Franklin University Chicago Medical School , Founder and Director of the Center for Medical Dermatology + Immunology Research . \"These three-year data show that raising the bar in atopic dermatitis treatment to long-term total skin clearance was an achievable treatment goal for at least half of EBGLYSS Week 16 responders, reinforcing its efficacy as a first-line biologic treatment for people with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis uncontrolled by topicals.\"\n\nAdditional study assessments conducted in patients with skin of color (ADmirable) and patients who were previously treated with dupilumab (ADapt) will also be presented at the meeting. Improvements of itch, skin pain (discomfort and soreness) and itch interference on sleep were measured using clinically meaningful thresholds for the validated patient-reported outcomes.8,9\n\nIn ADmirable, a first-of-its-kind EBGLYSS study specifically designed for people with skin of color and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, nearly 60% of patients achieved significant improvement in itch (Pruritus NRS \u22654-point improvement from baseline) and skin pain (\u22654-point improvement from baseline) at Week 16 (58% and 59% respectively). Over 30% of patients saw a reduction in sleep loss due to itch (\u22652-point improvement from baseline in Sleep-Loss Scale) at Week 16.8\n\nIn ADapt, a study of patients taking EBGLYSS who were previously treated with dupilumab, 75% achieved significant improvement in skin pain (\u22654-point improvement from baseline) and 62% achieved significant improvement in itch (Pruritus NRS \u22654-point improvement from baseline) at Week 24. Forty-two percent of patients saw a reduction in sleep loss due to itch (\u22652-point improvement in Sleep-Loss Scale) at Week 24.9\n\nThe reported endpoints for all studies were as observed.1,8,9\n\nThe safety profile in these studies was consistent with previous EBGLYSS Phase 3 studies in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, regardless of dose frequency, and no new safety signals were observed. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate and did not lead to discontinuation. Reported treatment-related side effects in the studies were conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions.\n\n\"We hear from patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that they struggle with recurring and unpredictable flares and are looking for treatment options that can provide long-term disease control,\" said Mark Genovese , M.D., senior vice president of Lilly Immunology development. \"EBGLYSS is the only first-line biologic treatment option for patients with disease uncontrolled by topicals to report completely clear skin at three years with a once-monthly maintenance dose. The additional assessments presented at AAD demonstrate significant improvements in disruptive symptoms, such as itch, across a range of patient groups.\"\n\nLilly has exclusive rights for development and commercialization of EBGLYSS in the U.S. and the rest of the world outside Europe . Lilly's partner Almirall has licensed the rights to develop and commercialize EBGLYSS for the treatment of dermatology indications, including atopic dermatitis, in Europe .\n\n* EASI =Eczema Area and Severity Index, EASI -90=90% reduction in EASI from baseline, EASI -100=100% reduction in EASI from baseline; IGA=Investigator's Global Assessment 0 or 1 (\"clear\" or \"almost clear\").\n\nAbout ADjoin\n\nADjoin (NCT04392154) evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of EBGLYSS treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis for up to 100 weeks (up to 152 weeks of continuous treatment with the parent studies). Patients taking EBGLYSS who completed any of the parent studies (ADvocate 1 and 2 monotherapy trials, ADhere, ADore, ADopt-VA) were able to enroll in ADjoin. The ADhere parent study included patients taking topical corticosteroids with EBGLYSS as a combination therapy. Patients could also enroll directly into ADjoin without participating in a parent study. Patients in this analysis of the long-term extension trial received a maintenance dose of either EBGLYSS 250 mg every two weeks or once monthly.1\n\nAbout ADmirable\n\nADmirable (NCT05372419) is a Phase 3b, open-label, 24-week study evaluating the safety and efficacy of EBGLYSS in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing \u226540 kg) with skin of color and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and defining innovative objective measures of pigment, and post-inflammatory hyper and hypopigmentation. Patients enrolled in the ADmirable study received a starting dose of EBGLYSS 500 mg subcutaneously initially and at two weeks followed by 250 mg every two weeks until Week 16. IGA 0,1 or EASI -75 responders at Week 16 received 250 mg once monthly and non-responders continued on 250 mg every two weeks until Week 24. Patients were allowed to stay on low- and mid-potency topical corticosteroids.8\n\nAbout ADapt\n\nADapt (NCT05369403), is an open-label, Phase 3b, 24-week study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of EBGLYSS in adults and adolescents (12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing \u226540 kg) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who were previously treated with dupilumab. After discontinuing dupilumab, patients were treated with EBGLYSS and received a starting dose of 500 mg subcutaneously initially and at two weeks followed by 250 mg every two weeks until Week 16. IGA 0,1 or EASI -75 responders at Week 16 received 250 mg once monthly and non-responders continued on 250 mg every two weeks until Week 24. Patients were allowed to stay on low- and mid-potency topical corticosteroids.9\n\nINDICATION AND SAFETY SUMMARY\n\nEBGLYSS\u2122 (EHB-glihs) is an injectable medicine used to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg) with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

IL-13 is implicated as a primary cytokine tied to the pathophysiology of eczema, driving the type-2 inflammatory loop in the skin, and EBGLYSS selectively targets IL-13.7\n\nThe EBGLYSS Phase 3 program consists of five key global studies evaluating over 1,300 patients, including two monotherapy studies (ADvocate 1 and 2), a combination study with topical corticosteroids (ADhere), as well as long-term extension (ADjoin) and adolescent open label (ADore) studies. Further data results from ADmirable are expected to be shared in 2025.\n\nEBGLYSS was approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2024 as the only first-line monotherapy biologic treatment with once-monthly maintenance dosing for adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is not well controlled with topical prescription therapies.7\n\nEBGLYSS 250 mg/2 mL injection is dosed as a single monthly maintenance injection following the initial phase of treatment. The recommended initial starting dose of EBGLYSS is 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) at Week 0 and Week 2, followed by 250 mg every two weeks until Week 16 or later when adequate clinical response is achieved; after this, maintenance dosing is a single monthly injection (250 mg every four weeks).7\n\nLilly is committed to serving patients living with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and is working to enable broad first-line biologic access to EBGLYSS following topical prescription therapy through commercial insurance and as of March 1 , Lilly gained coverage with two national pharmacy benefit managers. We are also pursuing similarly broad Medicaid and Medicare coverage as part of Lilly's health equity and affordability initiative. Through Lilly Support Services\u2122, Lilly offers a patient support program including co-pay assistance for eligible, commercially insured patients.\n\nAbout Lilly\n\nLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

Central to this rise was the encouraging long-term efficacy data for its drug EBGLYSS in treating atopic dermatitis, presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting. Supported by FDA approval in 2024, this product has bolstered investor confidence in the company's innovative pipeline. Additionally, positive earnings results for Q4 2024, with sales reaching $13.53 billion, played a key role, as did the European Medicines Agency\u2019s positive outlook on Jaypirca for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Amid a broader market slump, with major indexes like the Dow and S&P 500 on track for significant weekly losses, Eli Lilly's performance stands out, driven by these strategic developments and robust financial results, showcasing resilience in a volatile economic climate.\n\nClick here to discover the nuances of Eli Lilly with our detailed analytical report.\n\nNYSE:LLY Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past 5 years, Eli Lilly has achieved a very large total shareholder return of 670.12%, a reflection of its transformative journey. The company's development of Mounjaro, FDA-approved in 2022 for type 2 diabetes management, showcased its capacity for innovation. Moreover, strategic partnerships like the April 2022 collaboration with Genesis Therapeutics, valued at US$20 million, have bolstered its growth trajectory. The substantial US$2.1 billion investment in 2022 to expand manufacturing facilities in Indiana further underscored Eli Lilly's commitment to enhancing its production capabilities. Despite its high-priced earnings multiple compared to peers, the company's earnings growth over 2024 surpassed both industry and market benchmarks.\n\nIn the context of recent performance, it's important to highlight that Eli Lilly's one-year return outpaced both the US Pharmaceuticals industry and the broader market, which saw much smaller returns. This strong performance, coupled with a 15% increase in dividends announced in December 2024, reflects the company's robust earnings growth and ability to maintain investor confidence even amid broader market challenges.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The news sparked enthusiasm among traders, who began hoping for additional exemptions, causing the major stock indexes to rise slightly.\n\nBlue-chip companies gained 485.60 points or 1.14%, the broader market index rose 1.12%, while the NASDAQ stocks increased 1.46%. These rebounds come during a volatile week following a period of consecutive declines.\n\nAlthough many analysts have lowered their U.S. stock forecasts, citing that strong earnings in 2025 may be more challenging to achieve, the broader market index is still projected to end the year about 9% higher than in 2024. However, this is lower than the initial forecast of 12.2%, made in early January.\n\nOn the other hand, the big bets for this year are a productivity boost from the adoption of AI and the projection of lower interest rates. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said that while tariffs are never good for Wall Street, investors should take advantage of these periods to invest in the best tech stocks, reports CNN Business.\n\nAmid market fluctuations and uncertainty, insider trading often attracts significant attention. Executives and insiders, with their in-depth knowledge of company strategies, plans, and future prospects, may make trades worth analyzing. For instance, when a CEO or CFO invests their own funds in company stock, it can serve as a strong indicator of confidence in the company\u2019s future potential.\n\nSelling shares, on the other hand, may suggest that management is losing confidence, though this is not always the case. In some instances, large shareholders may simply be rebalancing their portfolios to better align with their desired risk/reward profile or selling for personal financial reasons. Additionally, many insiders sell shares as part of pre-arranged, automated trading plans known as 10b5-1 plans.\n\nBoth insider buying and selling can be influenced by various factors, so these actions should be interpreted within the broader context of the company\u2019s financial health, industry trends, and overall market conditions. This highlights the importance of conducting thorough research before making investment decisions. While insider trading activity can offer valuable insights into a company\u2019s prospects, it should be considered alongside other critical factors to ensure well-informed investment choices.\n\nToday, we\u2019re focusing on stocks that have seen insider sales of at least $10 million since the start of the year. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading screener, we identified stocks where at least one insider sale reached $10 million or more. While the total value of insider sales for these stocks may be higher, we focused on sales worth $10 million or more. Out of the stocks that met this criterion, we selected the 10 stocks with insider sales ranging from $10 million to $20 million, prioritizing those with the highest insider sales within this range for further analysis.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nFor each stock, we provide details on the highest individual sale, the number of insider sales exceeding $10 million year-to-date, and the company\u2019s current market capitalization. Let\u2019s take a look at 10 stocks with at least $10 million in insider sales since the beginning of the year.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nHighest Individual Sale: $19,507,205.25\n\nNumber of Sales Above $10 million: 24\n\nMarket Capitalization: $835.05 billion\n\nIn the middle of this list of 10 stocks with $10 million in insider sales recently is a multinational pharmaceutical firm, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Commonly known as Lilly, the Indianapolis, Indiana-headquartered company has offices in 18 countries and its products have reached approximately 125 countries worldwide. It is also one of the top 10 stocks to buy according to Lone Pine Capital.\n\nLilly is known for its clinical depression drugs Prozac (1986), Cymbalta (2004), and its antipsychotic medication Zyprexa (1996). Its primary revenue drivers are the diabetes drugs Humalog (1996) and Trulicity (2014).\n\nSince the beginning of the year, one insider made 24 sales of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares. One of the transactions was worth $19.51 million, during which the insider sold 21,025 shares at a price of $927.81 per share. Currently, the stock is trading at $929.72, having gained 20.43% year-to-date.\n\nRecently, Lilly announced it plans to bolster its domestic medicine production across therapeutic areas by building four new pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the U.S. This brings the company\u2019s total capital expansion commitments to more than $50 billion since 2020.\n\nLast week, the company also confirmed that the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion for Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib), a reversible Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The treatment is recommended for adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have previously been treated with a BTK inhibitor. The news caused its shares to jump 2.713%, from $905.16 to $929.72 per share.\n\nTwenty analysts have an average \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock, with a price target of $1,007.50 per share, according to MarketBeat.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 5th on our list of the stocks with at least $10 million in insider sales recently. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Every month, roughly 100,000 people buy Zepbound directly from Eli Lilly through its website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the size of a small city,\u201d says David Ricks, Eli Lilly\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s about 10% of the 1 million people who use the blockbuster obesity drug every month, though the numbers can vary, he says.\n\nThe customers are getting a significant discount, but there\u2019s a catch: they can\u2019t use their health insurance.\n\nLast summer, Lilly started selling vials of the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of Zepbound online through its LillyDirect platform. Patients either need a prescription from their doctor or can get one online through a Lilly partner. Now, the company is adding the 7.5 mg and 10 mg vials.\n\nAnd on Wednesday the maker of Wegovy, a similar weight-loss drug, announced that it, too, would offer direct-to-consumer discounts for patients paying cash.\n\nThe drugs usually come as autoinjector pens \u2014 like an EpiPen. But the LillyDirect Zepbound offer is for vials that patients inject themselves with, using an old-fashioned syringe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cultural phenomena,\u201d Ricks says of the drug. \u201cIt\u2019s used by millions of people in the U.S. and millions more would like to use it. So I think it\u2019s incumbent on us not just to invent great new medicines, but get them to patients.\u201d\n\nThe syringe option is cheaper for consumers: It costs between $349 and $699 a month for the vials compared to a list price of $1,086.37 per monthly injector pen.\n\nWegovy\u2019s maker, Novo Nordisk, is charging $499 per month for its direct-to-consumer product.\n\nCustomers can\u2019t get their health insurance to pay for the either Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound vials or the discounted Wegovy, though.\n\nThat\u2019s because a lot of health insurers don\u2019t cover Zepbound or Wegovy \u2014 or any drug specifically used to treat obesity. It\u2019s especially difficult for people with government insurance, because Medicare, for example, isn\u2019t allowed to cover weight-loss drugs. (It can cover Wegovy if the patient also has heart disease risk, but not for obesity alone.)\n\nIn fact, coverage is getting worse, according to a new report by GoodRx, a company that helps patients find discounts on drugs. The report determined that 4.9 million people whose health insurance covered Zepbound last year actually lost coverage of the drug in 2025.\n\nWhile the same report found Wegovy coverage is improving, many people still don\u2019t have insurance coverage for it.\n\nThe number of people who need obesity drugs coupled with their price has made it difficult for health insurance plans to cover them. For example, in North Carolina, the state health plan decided not to cover the drugs because it would have to increase monthly premiums for everyone by about $50 a month to do it.\n\nRicks says the LillyDirect model is \u201cnot a panacea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think actually a better way would be to have the normal health care system. Doctors and patients connect and then use the insurance they\u2019ve already paid the premium on to reimburse them for a chronic disease like obesity. That\u2019s not working perfectly right now. Here, we\u2019ll do what we can.\u201d\n\nStill, the company is not losing money on the discounted vials, Ricks says.\n\nZepbound brought in almost $5 billion in revenue last year, according to recent company data.\n\n\u201cThis is not a question of is Eli Lilly going to make enough money to recoup investment on the drug? They absolutely will,\u201d says Dr. Ben Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nRome, an internist, says he talks with patients about these medicines every week. But he says most Americans won\u2019t be able to afford even the discounted Zepbound vials.\n\n\u201cRemember Americans are already spending thousands of dollars a year on health care. So to say, well there is this medicine available but you have to pay for it out of pocket, it really serves a small percentage of the population.\u201d\n\nMost Americans \u201ccannot afford $500 or $600 per month,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not surprising to see Novo Nordisk jump in with a similar direct-to-consumer discount strategy as Lilly\u2019s. \u201cObviously, the two companies are competing to sell their products to people in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 out of every 5 American adults have obesity.\n\nIn the coverage void, many patients have turned to telehealth and compounding pharmacies to get weight-loss drugs like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s drug Wegovy. Compounders are allowed to make alternatives that aren\u2019t generics during drug shortages \u2013 and their prices tend to be well below list price.\n\nBut not all businesses selling those alternatives are licensed and following rules to keep their products safe.\n\nAnd now that the Zepbound shortage is over, the compounding is expected to stop.\n\nRicks says the company is pushing to expand health insurance coverage.\n\nOne thing Eli Lilly could do, says Rome, is give insurers the option of covering the cheaper Zepbound vials, so they can be more affordable to health plans and patients don\u2019t have to pay for them out of pocket.\n\n\u201cWe will see if Eli Lilly and Novo [Nordisk] come to the table and want to make these widely available, or if they\u2019re going to prioritize high prices and short-term profits over widespread access to the treatments,\u201d he says.",

Following the removal of these drugs from the FDA shortage list, the compounders trade group Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) filed lawsuits in an attempt to continue making the lucrative drugs.\n\nNow, Novo has followed Lilly in inserting itself in the nuanced legal situation just as a U.S. federal judge denies an injunction that would have given the OFA permission to continue making copies of Zepbound, Reuters reported.\n\nJudge Mark T. Pittman of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled on Wednesday that Novo Nordisk can intervene in the case brought against the FDA by OFA in response to the removal of Wegovy from the agency\u2019s shortage list, multiple outlets reported. This decision comes two months after a court granted Lilly similar permission for a separate lawsuit the OFA filed following Zepbound\u2019s removal from the FDA\u2019s shortage list and the same day that it sided with Lilly in denying an OFA injunction.\n\nIn the OFA\u2019s most recent lawsuit , the trade organization calls the FDA\u2019s decision \u201creckless and arbitrary decision,\u201d contending that it will deprive patients of vital treatments for type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and other serious medical conditions.\n\nPittman originally denied Novo\u2019s request to get involved in the case, ruling it premature, but reversed its decision Wednesday after the Danish pharma filed a renewed motion. With Wegovy and Ozempic far and away its top selling products\u2014over $8 billion in 2024 sales for the former and $16.9 billion for the latter\u2014Novo has substantial interest in ensuring the FDA comes out ahead in this lawsuit, effectively prohibiting compounders from making knock-off copies.\n\nWhen the agency declares a drug in shortage, Congress determined a doctor, pharmacist or licensed outsourcing facility is allowed to compound the drug appropriate to patient needs. With semaglutide no longer in that status, compounding pharmacies are no longer legally approved to make their own versions of the drug. According to the lawsuit, since the FDA placed semaglutide on the shortage list in 2022, patient demand has been satisfied thanks to pharmacies and outsourcing facilities.\n\nThe latest lawsuit closely mirrors the one filed by the OFA in October 2024 when the FDA ended the shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s GLP-1 + GIP combo, tirzepatide. The agency confirmed in December that tirzepatide was no longer in shortage status and gave compounders 90 days to cease production of their copycats. Lilly was eventually approved to intervene in that fight, which is before the same federal court.\n\nThe OFA has since filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing the FDA was making a decision applicable to the entire compounding industry, which would constitute as a rule. It is not clear at this time whether this is the injunction that was denied on Wednesday. Rulemaking for the agency comes with strict requirements including engaging the public with a notice-and-coment period, per the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nPrior to the overturning of Chevron deference last year, questions have swirled about the FDA\u2019s protocols for managing the drug shortage list. With pressures from parties like the OFA, the agency could face challenges in regulating the drug supply chain through this mechanism. The GLP-1 weight loss space is a particularly thorny area, with a thriving shadow market of not just compounders but research peptide makers all cashing in on the insatiable demand that originally sent Wegovy and Zepbound to the FDA\u2019s shortage list.\n\nEditor\u2019s note (March 6): This story has been udpated to include news of the court\u2019s Wednesday ruling in the case involving Eli Lilly.\n\n",

            "content": "Eli Lilly has reduced the prices of certain Zepbound vials and introduced higher-dose options, making the weight-loss drug more accessible for some patients.\n\nWhile these changes may help some patients who lack insurance coverage, experts argue that the cost of GLP-1 medications remains prohibitively high for many.\n\nThe move positions Lilly as a competitive alternative to compounded weight-loss drugs, especially as the FDA cracks down on off-brand versions.\n\nEli Lilly announced in a press release last week that it has reduced the prices of vials of its popular anti-obesity drug Zepbound and introduced new dosage options.\n\nThe company is now offering 7.5 mg and 10 mg vials, higher doses than it's offered since launching Zepbound vials in August. It\u2019s also slashing the cost of 2 mg and 5 mg vials by $50 a month.\n\nLike all of its Zepbound vials, the new dosages are available for eligible people who pay out of pocket through LillyDirect, the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer website. To use the vials, people have to draw out the medicine with a syringe and inject themselves with a needle.\n\nBefore launching the Zepbound vials in 2024, Eli Lilly offered the drug only in a single-dose injector pen, used once weekly, in doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 15 mg.\n\n\u201cWe launched the vials last year to help more people living with obesity manage this chronic condition, and many patients found success with Zepbound vials,\u201d Rhonda Pacheco, Group Vice President of U.S. Cardiometabolic Health at Eli Lilly and Company, told Health. \u201cThey appreciated that the self-pay option allows for full transparency on the price and quality of their medicine, so we decided to launch the higher doses for those who needed them to continue their weight loss journey.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the vials' cost, who can use them, and what experts think of the news.\n\nWho Is Eligible for the Vials?\n\nAnyone with a valid, on-label electronic prescription for Zepbound from a healthcare provider of their choice is eligible, Pacheco said.\n\nZepbound, a brand-name version of tirzepatide, is part of a class of medications called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists.\n\nIn 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved it for weight loss in adults with a body mass index over 30 or for those with a BMI of 27 and at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. In 2024, the FDA also green-lit it to treat moderate to severe sleep apnea.\n\nHow Much Do the Vials Cost Now?\n\nA four-week supply of a 2.5 mg single-dose vial now costs $349 monthly, down from $399. The 5 mg dose is $499, compared to $549 previously.\n\nThe new 7.5 mg and 10 mg vials cost $499 per month at first and for refills occurring within 45 days of the last delivery. Otherwise, the cost jumps to $599 for a 7.5 mg vial and $699 for a 10 mg one.\n\nThe higher-dose vials are cheaper than similarly dosed injector pens, which cost about $1,000 a month before insurance and are more expensive to make.\n\nWho Will Benefit From These Changes?\n\nMany insurance companies deny coverage for weight loss drugs, often because obesity is \u201cmisclassified as a lifestyle choice,\u201d Pacheco said.\n\nScott Isaacs, MD, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, said Eli Lilly is making Zepbound more accessible to a broader range of patients by lowering prices and offering more dosage options.\n\n\u201cThis puts it into the realm of affordability for some people who don\u2019t have coverage but have strong clinical indications and expected benefit,\u201d agreed Karl Nadolsky, DO, a clinical endocrinologist, obesity specialist, and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine.\n\nIsaacs said the changes may help Eli Lilly compete with compounded weight loss drugs, which have been riddled with safety concerns but are nonetheless relied on for their relative affordability and accessibility. It\u2019s legal for pharmacies to offer compounded drugs, which aren\u2019t FDA-approved, when an approved drug cannot meet a person\u2019s medical needs or there\u2019s a shortage of FDA-approved medications.\n\nBut many people have lost\u2014or soon will lose\u2014access to compounded drugs. In December, the FDA removed tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, from the shortage list. Many compounders had to stop producing weight-loss drugs \u201cthat are essentially a copy of\u201d tirzepatide in the name of meeting demand. In late February, the FDA delisted semaglutide, sold under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy. Compounding pharmacies have 60 or 90 days left to offer off-brand versions.\n\nPeople who can no longer buy compounded semaglutide may turn to Eli Lilly\u2019s cheaper Zepbound vials as an alternative, but Pacheco said the news didn\u2019t factor into Eli Lilly\u2019s decision. \u201cOur goal is to help patients achieve their health goals and remove systemic barriers where we can,\u201d she said.\n\nAccessibility Issues Remain\n\nEven with the reduced price of Zepbound vials, Isaacs said the cost of GLP-1 medications is still too high. \u201cThe prices of Zepbound vials remain unaffordable for the majority of people who do not have insurance coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nNadolsky said more changes are needed to make weight loss drugs widely accessible. \u201cThere needs to be some obvious changes in the United States regarding branded drug prices,\u201d he said, involving the operation of everything from insurance companies to pharmacies to large pharmaceutical companies.",

            "content": "Consumers can buy Zepbound and Wegovy direct from drugmakers if they pay cash\n\ntoggle caption Tetra Images/Tetra images RF/Getty Images\n\nEvery month, roughly 100,000 people buy Zepbound directly from Eli Lilly through its website.\n\n\"It's about the size of a small city,\" says David Ricks, Eli Lilly's CEO. That's about 10% of the 1 million people who use the blockbuster obesity drug every month, though the numbers can vary, he says.\n\nThe customers are getting a significant discount, but there's a catch: they can't use their health insurance.\n\nLast summer, Lilly started selling vials of the 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of Zepbound online through its LillyDirect platform. Patients either need a prescription from their doctor or can get one online through a Lilly partner. Now, the company is adding the 7.5 mg and 10 mg vials.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAnd on Wednesday the maker of Wegovy, a similar weight-loss drug, announced that it, too, would offer direct-to-consumer discounts for patients paying cash.\n\nThe drugs usually come as autoinjector pens \u2014 like an EpiPen. But the LillyDirect Zepbound offer is for vials that patients inject themselves with, using an old-fashioned syringe.\n\n\"It's a cultural phenomena,\" Ricks says of the drug. \"It's used by millions of people in the U.S. and millions more would like to use it. So I think it's incumbent on us not just to invent great new medicines, but get them to patients.\"\n\nThe syringe option is cheaper for consumers: It costs between $349 and $699 a month for the vials compared to a list price of $1,086.37 per monthly injector pen.\n\nWegovy's maker, Novo Nordisk, is charging $499 per month for its direct-to-consumer product.\n\nCustomers can't get their health insurance to pay for the either Eli Lilly's Zepbound vials or the discounted Wegovy, though.\n\nThat's because a lot of health insurers don't cover Zepbound or Wegovy \u2014 or any drug specifically used to treat obesity. It's especially difficult for people with government insurance, because Medicare, for example, isn't allowed to cover weight-loss drugs. (It can cover Wegovy if the patient also has heart disease risk, but not for obesity alone.)\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn fact, coverage is getting worse, according to a new report by GoodRx, a company that helps patients find discounts on drugs. The report determined that 4.9 million people whose health insurance covered Zepbound last year actually lost coverage of the drug in 2025.\n\nWhile the same report found Wegovy coverage is improving, many people still don't have insurance coverage for it.\n\nThe number of people who need obesity drugs coupled with their price has made it difficult for health insurance plans to cover them. For example, in North Carolina, the state health plan decided not to cover the drugs because it would have to increase monthly premiums for everyone by about $50 a month to do it.\n\nRicks says the LillyDirect model is \"not a panacea.\"\n\n\"We think actually a better way would be to have the normal health care system. Doctors and patients connect and then use the insurance they've already paid the premium on to reimburse them for a chronic disease like obesity. That's not working perfectly right now. Here, we'll do what we can.\"\n\nStill, the company is not losing money on the discounted vials, Ricks says.\n\nZepbound brought in almost $5 billion in revenue last year, according to recent company data.\n\n\"This is not a question of is Eli Lilly going to make enough money to recoup investment on the drug? They absolutely will,\" says Dr. Ben Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nRome, an internist, says he talks with patients about these medicines every week. But he says most Americans won't be able to afford even the discounted Zepbound vials.\n\n\"Remember Americans are already spending thousands of dollars a year on health care. So to say, well there is this medicine available but you have to pay for it out of pocket, it really serves a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMost Americans \"cannot afford $500 or $600 per month,\" he adds.\n\nHe says it's not surprising to see Novo Nordisk jump in with a similar direct-to-consumer discount strategy as Lilly's. \"Obviously, the two companies are competing to sell their products to people in the U.S.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 out of every 5 American adults have obesity.\n\nIn the coverage void, many patients have turned to telehealth and compounding pharmacies to get weight-loss drugs like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's drug Wegovy. Compounders are allowed to make alternatives that aren't generics during drug shortages \u2013 and their prices tend to be well below list price.\n\nBut not all businesses selling those alternatives are licensed and following rules to keep their products safe.\n\nAnd now that the Zepbound shortage is over, the compounding is expected to stop.\n\nRicks says the company is pushing to expand health insurance coverage.\n\nOne thing Eli Lilly could do, says Rome, is give insurers the option of covering the cheaper Zepbound vials, so they can be more affordable to health plans and patients don't have to pay for them out of pocket.\n\n\"We will see if Eli Lilly and Novo [Nordisk] come to the table and want to make these widely available, or if they're going to prioritize high prices and short-term profits over widespread access to the treatments,\" he says.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk is expanding its reach in the obesity medicines market by making its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy available directly to certain patients for more than half off the product\u2019s list price.\n\nThe new offering announced Wednesday is open to uninsured patients who pay for their medicines in cash as well as those whose insurance does not cover obesity drugs. Patients will still need a prescription for the once-weekly injectable drug. But rather going to a traditional pharmacy, patients will fill their prescriptions through NovoCare, a new online pharmacy set up by the Danish pharmaceutical giant.\n\nNovoCare will supply all dosage strengths of Wegovy in single-dose injection pens that will be shipped directly to a patient\u2019s home. The monthly price for Wegovy obtained through NovoCare is $499, which is a steep discount from the wholesale price of $1,349 for four Wegovy injection pens.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nNovo Nordisk reported 65.1 billion Danish krone (about $9.4 billion) in sales for obesity products in 2024, a 56% increase over sales in the prior year. The vast majority of that revenue came from Wegovy. The pharma giant wants to protect that revenue from competitors. Its new Wegovy offering is the latest salvo in the ongoing battle between makers of branded obesity drugs and compounding pharmacies.\n\nStrong demand for both Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound led to shortages of those products. Compounding pharmacies pounced, taking market share with their custom-made, lower-cost versions of GLP-1 obesity drugs, some of which were sold online. Novo and Lilly have challenged the purity and quality of compounded obesity drugs, but these versions of their drugs were permitted as long as the drug shortages continued.\n\nLate last month, the FDA declared the more than two-year shortage was over for products containing semaglutide, the main ingredient in Wegovy. The shortages for tirzepatide, the main ingredient in Zepbound, was declared resolved last December. Outsourcing Facilities Association, an organization that represents compounders, is suing the FDA for the moves, contending that shortages persist and the regulator\u2019s actions were made without due process. Both suits are filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s NovoCare mirrors LillyDirect, a direct-to-patient digital health platform from Eli Lilly. Last August, LillyDirect added Zepbound as an offering for patients who don\u2019t have insurance that covers obesity drugs. Vials of Zepbound are shipped directly to eligible patients, who must also obtain syringes to administer the drug themselves. After this new offering launched, Lee Brown of research firm Third Bridge told MedCity News that direct-to-patient sales enable pharma companies to use ecommerce to compete against compounders and circumvent traditional pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nSponsored Post Tackling Messy Provider Data with an NPI-Forward Approach Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.\n\nWhen Lilly initially unveiled this new Zepbound offering last year, only 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses were available, the lowest of the six doses available in injection pens. Last week, Lilly added 7.5 mg and 10 mg doses to the program. These new doses will cost $499 per month, which is a more than 50% discount from Zepbound available in injection pens. Lilly also cut the prices of the 2.5 mg vial to $349 per month, and the 5 mg vial to $499 per month.\n\nNovoCare\u2019s shipments of Wegovy will be fulfilled by CenterWell Pharmacy, the mail-order pharmacy business of health insurer Humana. Wegovy is not the only product offered through this new platform. NovoCare also lists Novo Nordisk diabetes products as well as the pharma giant\u2019s drugs for growth-related disorders, hemophilia, and hyperoxaluria.\n\n\u201cToday, over 55 million people in the U.S. have coverage specifically for weight management medicines, and 90% of Wegovy\u00ae patients with coverage pay $0 to $25 a month for Wegovy,\u201d Dave Moore, executive vice president, U.S. operations and global business development and president of Novo Nordisk, said in a prepared statement. \u201cWith NovoCare Pharmacy, patients and prescribers alike have another option that provides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group, via Getty Images",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEarnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization\u2019s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts\u2019 questions.\n\nFor February\u2019s edition, we highlight CFO takes from Palantir, MicroStrategy, Eli Lilly, Wynn Resorts, Chemours, Walmart, Krispy Kreme, Beyond Meat, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Lemonade.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nMarket cap: $197.25 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 3\n\nOn Palantir\u2019s latest earnings call, the strong relationship and differences between its CFO and CEO, who is equally passionate about his company as he is intellectually intense, were evident. When discussing how the company views partnerships, the differences between the executives seemingly embody their personalities. Though the company is likely facing headwinds due to government cuts, CFO David Glazer said its initiative to invest in quality engineers will help address any new demand or direction the company may take, as more than half of its business is reliant on government contracts.\n\n\u201cOn the investing front, [it's] quality engineering,\" Glazer said. \u201cYou can see it sort of how we set up our [compensation] programs\u2026 [the focus is] quality engineers more than the quantity. And you'll continue to see us do that this year.\u201d\n\nCEO Alex Karp dismissed the idea of partnerships with other technology companies to expand the business.\n\n\u201cThere used to be partnership meetings [that] were a complete waste of time and BS, largely so people could fill out a report that they met with us kind of thing, like high-school dating for nerds,\u201d Karp said. \u201cI met with them, perfect, I'm not going out with them. That was our experience with partnerships.\u201d\n\n2. MicroStrategy\n\nMarket cap: $71.38 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 5\n\nMichael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy, whose finances are led by CFO Andrew Kang, has a tremendous investment in bitcoin. In the latest earnings call, Kang detailed some of the company\u2019s holdings as it has become the world\u2019s first and largest bitcoin treasury company.\n\n\u201cWe acquired 218,887 bitcoins from the beginning of the fourth quarter until now for approximately $20.5 billion at an average price of $93,600 per bitcoin,\u201d Kang said. \u201cAs of Jan. 24, the company held a total of 471,107 bitcoins acquired for an aggregate cost of $30.4 billion or approximately $64,511 per bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company has added bitcoin to our balance sheet in every single quarter since August 2020 across 50-plus announcements, and 100% of our bitcoin holdings remain fully unencumbered,\u201d Kang said. \u201cAs of Feb. 2, 2025, the market value of our bitcoin holdings was $46.1 billion, purchased at an aggregate cost of $30.4 billion and an average bitcoin purchase price of $64,511.\u201d\n\n3. Eli Lilly\n\nMarket cap: $873.08 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 6\n\nEli Lilly CFO Lucas Montarce highlighted the company\u2019s push to advertise its GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s drug Kisunla and eczema drug Ebglyss. This success is likely isolated to just two countries \u2014 the U.S. and New Zealand \u2014 the only places in the developed world where direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceutical companies is legal.\n\n\u201cMarketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26%, mainly driven by promotional efforts to support ongoing and future launches,\u201d Montarce said. \u201cThis includes U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising on Zepbound and Mounjaro and U.S. launch activities for Kisunla and Ebglyss. We also increased our commercial investment outside the U.S. to support international launches of Mounjaro.\u201d\n\n4. Wynn Resorts\n\nMarket cap: $9.82 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 13\n\nWynn Resorts CFO Julie Cameron-Doe highlighted the company\u2019s strong financial position despite challenges around labor shortages in the industry. The company\u2019s strong position is also worth noting as many of its competitors struggle, particularly in Las Vegas, as Sin City\u2019s slowdown continues.\n\n\u201cOur liquidity position remains very strong, with global cash and revolver availability of $3.5 billion as of Dec. 31. This was comprised of $1.8 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the U.S.,\u201d Cameron-Doe said. \u201cThe combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally, with our properties generating nearly $2.4 billion at 2024 adjusted property EBITDA, together with our robust cash position, creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over four times. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allowed us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders.\u201d\n\n5. Chemours\n\nMarket cap: $2.07 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 18\n\nChemours, the mid-1990s DuPont spin-off widely known for manufacturing Teflon \u2014 a chemical currently being targeted by regulators and ditched en masse in kitchens across America \u2014 had CFO Shane Hostetter highlight how regulatory concerns can impact forecasts around advanced performance material production due to uncertainty regarding government regulations.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about [having] further conversations [with regulators and/or stakeholders], but if [they go] the other way, that's really what we were getting at as to potential regulatory pressure there,\u201d Hostetter said. \u201cAs I think about [the] next several years in APM, we're really committed to taking a look at just overall portfolio in line with Pathway to Thrive, and APM is certainly part of that and making sure that the product lines we're operating are optimized from a return basis and [we\u2019re] thinking through the next steps.\u201d\n\n6. Walmart\n\nMarket cap: $767.19 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 20\n\nWalmart CFO John David Rainey highlighted the success of the brand shifting its value proposition away from low prices and toward convenience.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the sensitivity of our model to the macro environment, I hope investors think differently about Walmart because our customers and members are telling us that they do,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cWe're not just known for value, we're also increasingly known for convenience.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur business is performing well\u2026 but this increased relevance translates into improved financial performance for us [too]. As we grow these digital businesses like e-commerce, the incremental margins in our e-commerce business globally for us in the quarter were 11%, over twice the rate of what our overall margin is\u2026 our business outperformed on virtually every operational and financial metric in the quarter,\u201d Rainey said.\n\n7. Krispy Kreme\n\nMarket cap: $1.03 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 25\n\nAs the company shifts from a bakery business to a hub-and-spoke model by selling its products in grocers and launching campaigns at McDonald\u2019s, Krispy Kreme CFO Jeremiah Ashukian responded candidly to analysts asking about the expenses of the transition and its impact on EBITDA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun to scale obviously to support [the delivered fresh daily campaign] expansion in the U.S., including McDonald's with our existing in-house models to start,\u201d Ashukian said. \u201cIn February, we moved to the contract phase and [we] remain engaged with multiple carriers to finalize [contracts]. While we go through this phase and into the rollout, we do expect some transition costs [as we] move into an outsourced model.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, there is EBITDA pressure. But we are targeting EBIT neutral. However, we're still in the negotiation phase, [though] expected costs are contemplated in our [forecasts],\u201d Ashukian said.\n\n8. Beyond Meat\n\nMarket cap: $210.28 million\n\nDate of call: Feb. 26\n\nBeyond Meat CFO Lubi Kutua spoke extensively about how price increases drive one of the company\u2019s main key performance indicators \u2014 net revenue per pound growth \u2014 across multiple business areas. These price increases, though they show growth, only offset declining sales due to weakening demand in both consumers and food service.\n\n\u201cThe increase in net revenue per pound was primarily driven by lower trade discounts compared to the year-ago period, as well as price increases of certain of our products, partially offset by changes in product sales mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates,\u201d Kutua said.\n\n\u201cBreaking this down by channel, U.S. retail net revenues increased 5.7% to $33.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $32.1 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to a 10.6% increase in net revenue per pound partially offset by a 4.5% decrease in volume of products sold,\u201d said Kutua. \u201cNet revenue per pound benefited from lower trade discounts, price increases of certain products, and changes in product sales mix, while the decrease in volumes sold primarily reflected soft category demand and price elasticity effects.\u201d\n\n9. Anheuser-Busch InBev\n\nMarket cap: $111.44 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 26\n\nAs its future customer base continues to ditch alcohol in droves, Anheuser-Busch InBev CFO Fernando Tennenbaum reminded analysts the company isn\u2019t looking to buy its way into new markets anytime soon. He reassured that its capital allocation strategies are disciplined, and organic growth is still the priority.\n\n\u201cIt's worth reminding [everyone] that the objective of our capital allocation policy is value creation,\u201d Tennenbaum said. \u201cThe framework is unchanged, and we remain disciplined in our choices. So, priority number one has always been investing in the organic growth of our business. We have a very good business with no shortage of opportunities to invest.\u201d\n\n10. Lemonade\n\nMarket cap: $2.48 billion\n\nDate of call: Feb. 26\n\nAs auto insurance providers continue to raise rates across the country, Lemonade and its CFO Tim Bixby continue to disrupt the market through AI-powered underwriting technology. As the company\u2019s CEO noted in a recent letter to investors, its \u201crelentless pursuit of automation at every stage\u201d is still in full swing.\n\n\u201cQ4 brought our best-ever loss ratio, helping to drive a near doubling of gross profit in 2024,\u201d Bixby said. \u201cIn-force premium grew 26% to $944 million, while customer count increased by 20% to 2.4 million. Premium per customer increased 5% versus the prior year to $388, driven primarily by rate increases. Annual dollar retention, or ADR, was 86%, down one percentage point since this time last year.\u201d",

            "content": "It's often challenging to decide which stocks to invest in. However, some companies look too attractive to pass up. We asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick slam-dunk growth stocks investors can confidently add to their portfolios. They chose three famous drugmakers: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). Read on to discover why.\n\nOne of the top growth stocks in the industry\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): What's considered excellent revenue growth depends on the industry. For pharmaceutical companies, especially those with a market cap above $50 billion, year-over-year top-line increases in the high-single-digit percentages are already pretty strong. With that context in mind, consider that Eli Lilly's revenue growth has not dipped below 20% since mid-2023.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nLLY Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nLLY Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nThe company is firing on all cylinders, largely thanks to its work in the diabetes and obesity markets. Eli Lilly's medicines, such as Mounjaro and Zepbound, are racking up incredible sales, and they are still on an upward path. Further, other recent launches should soon contribute to the drugmaker's results, which will help it deal with the mounting competition in its core area of expertise. Perhaps Eli Lilly's most promising recent approval is Kisunla, an Alzheimer's disease treatment.\n\nDespite an aging population, few medicines in this field have earned the green light from regulators in the past two decades. So, there is a vast unmet need here. Enter Kisunla, which should easily crack blockbuster status at its peak. But that's not all. From Eli Lilly's other recent launches, such as cancer medicine Jaypirca, to exciting pipeline candidates like Retatrutide -- a potential next-gen anti-obesity medicine -- not to mention a steady and growing dividend, Eli Lilly has much to offer growth and income-oriented investors.\n\nThe company remains a strong buy despite not performing in line with the market in the past six months.\n\nA big biotech company with multiple growth opportunities\n\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't just have one path to growth. This big biotech company has multiple growth opportunities. And those opportunities are big ones.\n\nVertex achieved tremendous success with its cystic fibrosis (CF) therapies. The company still has plenty of room to grow in the CF market, especially with its recently approved drug Alyftrek. Not only is Alyftrek more effective than Vertex's top-selling Trikafta, but it also has a more convenient once-daily dosing. In addition, Vertex's royalty burden is lower with Alyftrek than with its older CF therapies.\n\nGene-editing therapy Casgevy has been approved for over a year in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Sure, it only generated revenue of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, Vertex still thinks Casgevy has multibillion-dollar potential as its commercial launch ramps up.\n\nI'm especially optimistic about the prospects for Vertex's new pain drug Journavx. Its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January 2025 marked the first U.S. approval of a non-opioid pain therapy in more than 20 years. I predict Journavx will become a blockbuster drug sooner than Casgevy.\n\nVertex's growth prospects look even better when we factor in its late-stage pipeline programs. The company hopes to win another indication for Journavx in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It has two candidates in phase 3 testing targeting kidney diseases: inaxaplin for APOL1-mediated kidney disease and povetacicept for IgA nephropathy. Vertex could even cure severe type 1 diabetes with zimislecel.\n\nMagnificent growth stock? I think Vertex Pharmaceuticals is definitely worthy of the description.\n\nAmgen is a top growth stock with a lot of potential in the GLP-1 market\n\nDavid Jagielski (Amgen): One pharma stock that hasn't gotten much love of late is Amgen. Although it's a beast in the healthcare industry, with a market cap of more than $165 billion, investors may be overlooking the potential upside it possesses, specifically in the GLP-1 weight loss market.\n\nInvestors dumped the stock late last year because its once-per-month injection, MariTide, fell short of analyst expectations as it helped people lose only 20% weight in a phase 2 trial -- analysts were expecting 25%. However, the silver lining is that there was no plateau and some people in the clinical trial took it less frequently than once per month; it's possible that greater weight loss may be attainable with the treatment.\n\nA stock with a promising GLP-1 treatment can sometimes trade at a premium, and yet, for Amgen, it's trading at just 15 times next year's estimated earnings (based on analyst projections), making it a potential bargain buy. That's not a bad deal for a stock which also pays a dividend that yields more than 3% and which grew its top line by 19% in 2024, to $33.4 billion.\n\nThe company has been growing its business via acquisitions in recent years and with a promising pipeline which features dozens of phase 3 trials, this makes for a potentially underrated growth stock to hang on to for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the airwaves. Motley Fool senior analysts Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. Fools, great to have you both here. Dylan. This week, fresh off their earnings report. We've got Axon's president on the major growth levers for the company. We have plenty of company results for you guys to dig into, and of course, you both brought your stocks on your radar this week. To kick us off, we have results from the chipmaker NVIDIA. Jason, it feels like one of those '90s teen movies where everyone has been waiting for the popular kid to show up at the party.\n\nJason Moser: I love the '90s teen movies reference. It feels we've been saying this a lot with NVIDIA recently. You need to be aware of the burden of great expectations. This is a company that just continues to lob up amazing numbers. This was an absolutely fine quarter, but the market has its sights obviously set very high on this one. That probably explains a little bit of the volatility in the share price this week. But I think when you look into the numbers, the numbers, I think were great. Revenue $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially but even more impressively, it was up 78% from a year ago, and it beat their outlook of $37.5 billion. Now if you break that down, the datacenter revenue, which is clearly the gist of this business.\n\nThe crux of this business, datacenter revenue of $35.6 billion. That was a record for the company. That was up 93% from a year ago, as the Blackwell ramp commenced. They continued to see strong demand in Hopper, Hopper 200, that continued sequential growth. But ultimately they delivered $11 billion in Blackwell revenue which I thought was very encouraging, they saw, obviously, the large cloud service providers that represented about half of their data center revenue overall. Big spending from the biggest of spenders. Gaming revenue, $2.5 billion. I was down 11% from a year ago. The professional visualization side of the business. That revenue of $511 million was up 10% from a year ago. Then finally, the automotive and robotics segment. That revenue of $570 million for the quarter was up 103% from a year ago. This was something. I had to double check this in McCall, because I was amazed by this. The automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion for this coming fiscal year.\n\nNow, that compares to $1.7 billion from this last year. We can see some real progress being made in that automotive and robotics segment of the business, but gross margin down slightly. That was expected as this Blackwell ramp continues. They're making sure they get products out to consumers as fast as they can. But again I think all things considered a very good quarter. It's just the market has very high expectations for this business today.\n\nDylan Lewis: There have been some concerns around AI workloads. The DeepSeek Saga made a lot of people wonder exactly how real and how sustained the chip demand is going to be. Jensen Huang doesn't seem all that concerned. He had some comments on the conference call, Jason, basically saying we are seeing much more adoption of a reasoning approach to LLMs and AI work. That's just the beginning. We're going to see more simulation and search based models, and that is going to drive a lot more compute than we currently have, and that a lot of people are currently using. Essentially he's not worried about demand for chips or their Data Center business anytime soon.\n\nJason Moser: Well, I love the cloud puns there Dylan. I feel that was intentional. I'm going to go ahead and give you credit for it. It's an interesting question. There's a narrative now where we're deliberating, what is the actual demand. This question really boils down to demand. On one side of the coin, the questions are growing. Are we overbuilding? Some think so, perhaps. Obviously, as you mentioned, this computational prowess requires a lot of power. I think that would speak to the demand there. You look at Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. He just said the other day, on the other hand, there's not enough chips and power to meet AI demand. I think that's a question that investors will have to deliberate as we move forward with the story.\n\nDylan Lewis: As you noted, Market took a little bit of a breather on this report, shares down about 10% this week. Matt it seems some of that is earnings. Some of that is what I'm going to call macro Malaise affecting stocks right now.\n\nMatt Argersinger: I think that's right Dylan. I like what Chemo said about the burden of high expectations for a company like NVIDIA. I think that's the case for most of the Mag7. If you look at what led the stock market over the last two years, it was these massive technology companies, and, of course, NVIDIA was at the spear tip. That. But look what's happened in the market. The S&P 500 it's down about 5%. This is as of Friday morning down about 5% from its high. Not a big move.\n\nBut look what's happened to the Mag7. Apple down about 9%, Meta down 11%, Amazon 14%, Microsoft is down 16, Alphabet down 18 and NVIDIA which we talked about down almost 22%, and Tesla down 42% guys. I'm not saying this is a sea change in the market, but I do think some of the things that really worked over the last two years are not working so far here in 2025. Some of the things that didn't work, and I know about a lot of these, real estate industrials and dividend-paying stocks are doing great so far in 2025. It just makes you wonder, is this a shift in market?\n\nDylan Lewis: Seems Apple is trying to get the market excited about some of its domestic investments this week, company announcing $500 billion in commitments to fund new internal initiatives and manufacturing here in the US. Jason, it seems a lot of this is focused on some of their artificial intelligence, machine learning, and chip capabilities.\n\nJason Moser: I think big picture, Apple and beyond. These are investments in the US. Companies are starting to look at their supply chains a little bit more closely. Obviously a priority of this current administration is to reduce reliance on certain entities in that supply chain. China stands out as an example there. Companies are definitely trying to see around the corner. I think in regard to Apple, it makes a lot of sense. That's a lot of money $500 billion over the next four years. Clearly a company that can afford it. But again speaks back to the investments that we're seeing from all of these big tech companies in their AI aspirations. Apple has flown under the radar with all of this stuff right now. When we're talking about AI, Apple's not really the first company that's coming to mind, and maybe these investments will start to shift that discussion a little bit.\n\nDylan Lewis: Apple not alone in making commitments this week, drug maker Eli Lilly also announcing plans to invest over $25 billion. Yes, a bit smaller than that $500 billion commitment we saw from Apple. But Eli Lilly is doing their part. Matt for them, they are focusing on boosting supplies of the weight loss and diabetes drugs, also looking to fuel some new drug development. It feels with both of these stories, it's a bit of where the world is going. Really we can't be that surprised that these companies are making these commitments.\n\nMatt Argersinger: No, and I think this is where the world's been going really since the pandemic. Jamo talked about supply chain issues with Apple. It was acute for the healthcare space in those early days of COVID. A lot of investments have already been made to try to fix those supply chains, make sure that there's redundant inventory of medical devices and drugs here in the US. I think a lot of these investments were already in the pipeline. I think the Trump administration has given these companies, well, a gentle push a gentle as Trump can be with these things.\n\nBut with Apple in particular, most of their products are made in China, 10% tariff they've gotten around that in the past, but maybe they wouldn't get around this time, so maybe that's a little more incentive for them to invest. But Eli Lilly, I think, was seeing the demand already. They had to make investments.\n\nJason Moser: I think Matt is absolutely right there. It is really about trying to figure out ways to diversify that supply chain. I think with regard to Eli Lilly in specific, remember too, lawmakers here in the US, they're considering legislation this thing called the Biosecure Act. This is a bill that would prevent US companies from working with certain Chinese biotech companies, and companies like Eli Lilly are very dependent on that China supply chain source. They are absolutely dependent on China as a part of their supply chain, and this Biosecure Act could really fundamentally change that. It absolutely makes sense that they're, again, trying to see around that corner and make some investments to get away from that dependency.\n\nDylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got a retailer returning to its winning ways. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool money.\n\nWelcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Here on air with Motley Fool analysts, Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. We're kicking off this earnings rundown with one of the companies Arman behind the glass, Dan Boyd absolutely loves. It's where Doors Get More done Home Depot. Matt, looking at the results. It seems there are more doors doing a bit more doing this quarter.\n\nMatt Argersinger: A bit more Dylan. Comps and earnings came in a little bit better than management was expecting than what they had guided for a quarter ago. It was a better quarter. But I would just say this you can't really write home about 1.3% growth in US comps, especially when you're starting to lap pretty slow results a year ago, with a lot of HD comps. I take it with a grain of salt. Operating margin was down again. Earnings per share were higher, but that was because there was an extra week of sales in this fourth quarter than a year ago. You take that out, the $0.30 they got from that, and earnings per share were lower again. The dividend was only raised 2.2%. That was the smallest increase for Home Depot in 13 years. So disappointing.\n\nLook guidance for 2025, was really not that great. I'm looking for another year of flat to slightly higher comps, lower earnings. I really Dylan, it comes down to customers just still being reluctant to spend on big ticket items, not doing a lot of kitchen or bathroom remodels. The pro side is definitely holding up better, but until the housing market gets unstuck, we've talked about this. Existing home sales are at multi-decade lows. Mortgage rates are back near 7%. Without a pickup on transactions in the home front, it's hard to see AC sales gaining attraction. By the way, at this stage in Home Depot's development evolution, I should say. They're store growth isn't going to do it. They're only going to open 13 stores this year. That's on a base of more than 2,300 stores. The unit economics at the storefront have to get better, and I don't see them getting better until we have a housing recovery.\n\nDylan Lewis: It speaks to how much I want to see this business turn it around that I am cheering single digit top line growth. [laughs] But we've been waiting to see both top line growth from this business and same store sales positive again. Now we have both on the right track. But Jason Home Depot is not without a new challenge. We talked about some of the macro stuff a little bit earlier. Tariffs, certainly something that will affect a business like Home Depot. What is the outlook there?\n\nJason Moser: Well, Matt, I know that wasn't the biggest dividend boost in the world, but 2.35% yield to sit there and be patient with a business like this. I'm OK with hanging in there, just waiting it out. But I think tariffs is something we're talking about across the market here. I think the encouraging thing here in regard to Home Depot, it was not a huge theme or concern in the call. They got a couple of questions on it. It's something that they continue to deal with. But going back to that conversation with regard to Apple and Eli Lilly, this is something that's been in the It's been on their radar for a while. They've been working at this over the last six to seven years trying to diversify that supply chain and get away from having to worry so much so all they mentioned in a call really in regard to this, they're not terribly worried about it.\n\nThey feel they've got the best team in place to deal with it. Given their experience in dealing with it over the last seven years plus, they're confident they'll be able to navigate those choppy waters if they arise. I think in that regard, this is just another thing where you look at a company like Home Depot. This is clearly something where their scale is just a very big advantage and these types of things ebb and flow. This two shall pass, and I think Home Depot will be just fine.\n\nDylan Lewis: Jason, keeping the earnings beat going, do you know who has two thumbs and is down on his biggest possession this week?\n\nJason Moser: That ain't me.\n\nDylan Lewis: This guy. Shares of body cam and Taser Maker Axon, one of my largest holdings, down about 10% following their quarterly update this week. Shares about 25% off highs recently. What's going on here?\n\nJason Moser: Well, it's been a volatile stretch to be sure. The stock is down 11% on the year. It's still better than 90% over the last 12 months, so let's give him credit where credit's due. But market volatility aside, I would say this was a very impressive quarter from a company that they don't seem to stand still Dylan. They just keep innovating and bringing new things to market. The revenue for the quarter, $575 million that was up 34% from year ago. It marked their 12th consecutive quarter of over 25% revenue growth. They saw double-digit growth year over year, in all of their business areas, Taser up 37%, censors up 18%, software and services up 41%. That's all very encouraging.\n\nIt's also very encouraging that the two areas where they're most excited about today are the enterprise and international segments because they are just a lot of opportunities to expand their business. They signed the biggest deal in company history with a global logistics provider. That's in the enterprise segment. We'll probably learn who that is later on down the road. But I think one of the things to consider that drove a lot of the volatility of this headline out recently in regard to flox safety technology start-up known for its automated license plate reader solution. They were partners since April 2020. This seems to be a bit more of a negotiating tactic. It doesn't seem like they're trying to part ways. I think they're just trying to make this relationship work better for both companies. I wouldn't be surprised to see news here in the near future where these two companies are happy working together again.\n\nDylan Lewis: We'll have a bit more commentary on Axon's quarter from President Josh Isner. You got the chance to speak with him earlier this week. That's coming up after the break. Before we get there, though, digging results from Mediterranean Fast Casual Chain Kava, Matt, serving up some spicy lamb for its fourth quarter results. But the market seemed to be focused on some guidance that could use a little salt here.\n\nMatt Argersinger: That's right, not quite as spicy on the guidance. I'm not surprised that the stock has sold off as it has since those earnings because of the guidance. If you look at the results themselves, hard to find anything to complain about, 21%, same restaurant sales growth in the fourth quarter, a 15.6% increase in traffic. Restaurant profit margin continues to increase for CAVA. But when it came to guidance looking at comps of 6-8%, that's about half of what Cava did in 2024 for the full year. That was probably disappointing to see growth decelerate that fast. You have to remember, going to the report how richly the stock was valued. Cavas Market Cap about a month ago was over 16 billion, which valued each restaurant at around 45 million per store.\n\nAsk yourself if you're an aspiring restaurateur, would you spend 45 million on a store that generates about 3 million in revenue and about 600,000 in profit. I don't think you would do that Dylan. I certainly would. Even look at Chipotle 10 years ago when it was at the same stage as Cava, its restaurants never traded near that valuation. Even after the sell off, you're still looking at a pretty richly priced stock, but results have been fantastic. This is still an awesome emerging market concept that I think we know has plenty of runway of growth. This might be one of those opportunities to invest and behind a sell off.\n\nDylan Lewis: Jason, this is one of those companies where a lot of things do have to go right. We know they need to continue building at their growth story with their store footprint. We need to see comps hold up. But I'm curious. Do you think the market is weighing the fact that there might be some burgeoning competition from the Moser household and in particular, the Jason Moser menu?\n\nJason Moser: [laughs] It's a very fair question, Dylan and I appreciate you bringing that up. We were talking before taping here that I discovered the recipe for that spicy lamb meatball mix there, and I'm going to tell you what, it is really good.\n\nDylan Lewis: Well, maybe we'll drop that in the episode description. If that's available somewhere, Jason. For folks that are listening to this week's radio show in podcast form. That's why it's worth subscribing. You get those little bonus nuggets here and there.\n\nJason Moser: It works for me. Fool food. I've talked about it before.\n\nDylan Lewis: Up next, Jason's going to keep the earnings focus, digging further into Axon's results with Company president Josh Isner. Stay right here. Listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nmusic: I'm not feeling right today. I'm not feeling that great. I'm not catching on fire today. Love has started to fade. I'm not going to smile today. I'm not going to lie. You're outliving it up to date. I've got dues to pay in the grave digger, put on the forceps. The stone mason does all the work. The barber can give you a haircut. The carpenter can take you out to lunch. Now, I just want to play on my panpipes. I just want to drink me some wine. As soon as you're born, you start dying. You might as well have a good time on.\n\nDylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Listeners, we gave you a quick rundown on Axon's earnings earlier in the show, now for the Deep Dive on the body camera and Taser Maker that holds the spot as the largest holding in my portfolio. Fool analyst Jason Moser caught up with Axon's president Josh Isner to talk through the company's recently reported quarter, some of the major growth opportunities ahead, and how the business is approaching the focus on government budgets and tariff talks.\n\nJason Moser: Josh, let's talk a little bit about the results. This is another report with a lot to like on both the quarter and the year. Clearly, the market having a very positive reception to what you all reported. A number of milestones, I thought, for the quarter and for the year, reading through the shareholder letter, what stands out to you in regard to this quarter that you all just reported?\n\nJosh Isner: It's probably a couple of things. Jason, again, thank you for having me on. It's good to see you again. I think the standouts are, look, our revenue growth rate, seeing that at 30% plus for three straight years now on top of probably four or five years behind it at 25% plus growth, that's exciting, as the numbers get bigger, to see the growth really endure. Then bookings, that's one of the forward indicators of our business that we look at a lot is making sure that total contract value is representative of continued growth out into the future. That came in at over five billion dollars this year.\n\nThat's a record for us, and we're really proud of that and can't wait to hopefully break that record this year. Then lastly, the enterprise segment. This is the customer base that is not part of public safety. Think like retailers, logistics companies, etc, we actually closed our biggest deal in company history in that segment. Even considering law enforcement, the federal government, our international customers, enterprise now holds the biggest deal in company history, which I think is a really exciting sign for the things to come in that market.\n\nJason Moser: Absolutely. I'm glad you brought up enterprise. I definitely want to get to that just a minute. One thing that stood out to me for the quarter, it just seems like you guys do this quarter in and quarter out. Net revenue retention at 123%, that's just been such a strong metric for you all, and I think it really speaks to not only bringing your customers into your universe, but then keeping them and expanding those relationships over time. I thought that was a really encouraging metric. The one thing I was really surprised to see pleasantly, I'll say, you raised your total addressable market opportunity rather significantly.\n\nNow, last, I think I saw in the first quarter of the year, you raised it from 50 billion to 77 billion. I know typically you guys do that on a two-year cadence, and this was an exception because of some acquisitions. But now you see this total addressable market at an eye catching $129 billion. Now, you guys just crossed over the two billion dollar revenue mark. There clearly is a lot of opportunity there, but what are the drivers behind raising that total addressable market so significantly?\n\nJosh Isner: I think, like you had alluded to, the enterprise segment is a big part of that, as well as more products fit across many of our markets. Whereas two years ago, we had fewer products and we were in fewer markets, now we have more products, and we've established ourselves in more markets. I think it's safe to assume that with more products available, sales can increase in those markets, and that's really what's driving the TAM update there. It's exciting stuff. We're very excited to see the continued opportunity. It's a story of one thing leading to another, where we solve problems for our customers and more opportunities present themselves. You were talking about our NRR number. We really work hard to drive a great customer experience, and we want our customers to be fans of ours. NPS, we consider one of the biggest indicators in our business. We're very proud of our NPS score, and we take it very seriously.\n\nWhen you invest in your customers and really feel like, hey, the customer is at the center of everybody at Axons universe, not just our sales team or our executive team, but the folks in finance, the folks in people ops. Every policy, everything we do, we make sure that the outcome is going to be better for our customers. When we have that mindset, I think it leads to exciting results like this.\n\nJason Moser: Absolutely. On the call, you talked about two customer groups in particular that you're really excited about. That gets back to Number 1, the enterprise customer, and then also international. Let's go ahead and start with enterprise, and I'm glad you clarified that for listeners, exactly what enterprise customers are. You know and you booked the largest deal in company history with a global logistics provider. I'm going to take a shot here because I have to. Any hint as to who this global logistics provider is?\n\nJosh Isner: We will be announcing them by name in the coming months, but for now, we're just sticking with global logistics. But I will tell you this, they are my favorite global logistics partner in history. I will not partner or even as a consumer use any other product moving forward. When companies show faith in us, where we get excited about that.\n\nJason Moser: Well, I respect that. We'll just stay tuned and look for that name. It's need to think about this being the biggest deal that you've signed. I wonder, was this an all encompassing deal or is it one where this is a really big customer that signed on for a couple of things that will then give you the opportunity to cross sell in the future.\n\nJosh Isner: We hope it's the latter, for sure. The deal includes body cameras, evidence.com licensing and our Fusus product, and we're really pleased to get off the ground there. But certainly, we think there's going to be a lot of future opportunities around drones and robotics, around more video tools and AI, around drone defense and mitigation. All of these are in the logistics world. You can imagine you're housing millions of dollars of merchandise in warehouses. You've got a lot of risk in terms of liability, in terms of handling merchandise and items for both civilians and for enterprises, and all of a sudden, those warehouses could become targets of drones. To have drone defense and awareness capabilities around all your highest value assets, we think that's going to be a growing market, as well.\n\nJason Moser: Well, the other demographic that we're very excited about international, we saw sequential growth there of 50%, which was really impressive considering that's on top of 40% from just a quarter ago. We know your aspirations in regard to this international business. I think it's in the 20-25% range of your business today. But you ultimately see it becoming probably closer to 80%, that international opportunity. Now, that's obviously a little ways down the road, I would think. But what is going well? What's driving the growth there in those international markets?\n\nJosh Isner: I think we've had good product market fit in international historically, especially with our TASERS and body cameras. I think the part of the equation that's changing a little is now some of these international customers are growing more and more open to storing digital evidence in the cloud, and that hasn't always been the case. I think that's part of the equation. The other part of it is we've made some major upgrades on our team this year. We have our new CRO, Cameron is based in Europe. He comes from AWS, where he ran Europe, Middle East and Africa or AWS, and very talented guy and very thoughtful about how we go to market international, and as a combination of having a good sound strategy and bringing on the right country managers and resources around those country managers. I think those investments are starting to make a difference in our international business, and like you said, there's a huge opportunity out there. I think we will have failed as a company if our international business doesn't surpass our US public safety business at some point, because the reality is there's just way more customers internationally, way more users, and it's our job to figure out how we can build the exact right products for them that'll drive the type of value that our products drive in the US.\n\nJason Moser: You acquired a business last year. You just mentioned it earlier, Fusus. I wonder, could you just give us a little explanation, give our listeners a little explanation what Fusus is and how it ultimately is making Axon's business stronger.\n\nJosh Isner: We're very proud to have them on our team now. Chris Lindenau is their founder and he built a very good team and product over at Fusus. We call it the Switzerland of CCTV. [LAUGHTER] Essentially, think about all of your different camera feeds you might have in your building or interior or exterior. You might have a bunch of different vendors in terms of hardware. Fusus essentially fuses all of those camera feeds together into one pane of glass. If you're in a real time crime center and you're looking at everything going on, you can get an alert right into your crime center, oh, this business, there's a theft in progress or something, and the police can actually see it and react accordingly. Then, of course, for city owned and police owned cameras as well, same dynamic. We were never super excited about getting into the fixed camera business in terms of hardware. But in terms of software and being able to fuse all those feeds together, that's extremely valuable for our customers.\n\nJason Moser: Another story that has continued to go on with what seems like a lot of red tape is your real estate aspirations in the state of Arizona. I saw on a call that it doesn't seem like it's something that's going to resolve itself soon. But I guess first, I just wanted to start with a strategy behind all of this because it's a pretty grand vision. Can you explain exactly what the vision is here. This is not an insignificant investment on Axon's part. I think some investors maybe feel like it could be something that is taking the company's focus away. I would imagine you all view it differently.\n\nJosh Isner: Our company was started in Arizona. Rick started it in his garage in Tucson. Arizona's very much been near and dear to our hearts, and we love being there. I've lived in Arizona for the last 16 years and made a lot of great friends out there. We've had a lot of success as a business, and we love being there. Candidly, Jason, Arizona's just got to decide if it wants to be a business oriented state or a retirement oriented state. There's a big anti-development sentiment in Arizona, and now our project was actually approved by the Scottsdale City Council. It was zoned and we were ready to go. Then an out of state union came in and partnered with a former politician in Arizona to essentially pay to get signatures to put this out to referendum. I think 93% of the signatures garnered were from paid signature gatherers. Most of the money came in from out of state. It's one of these where it's like, wait a sec. This is our land. The city already said we could build this thing on it. Why is it that the elected officials in Scottsdale can't speak for the city anymore? Why do we have to wait two years for this to go out to referendum now? Arizona just lost Anderl. They went to Ohio.\n\nWhat does Ohio have to offer that Arizona doesn't? Nothing against Ohio, but Arizona is a great state, too. I think it's a matter of, look, does the state really want to be a state where businesses can thrive, or is it going to be anti-development and focus more on residential and retirement, which is fine. But that's a choice of theirs to make. Where the rubber hits the road on this for us, Jason, is that there are no top 100 colleges in Arizona. We have to import a lot of the talent at Axon from other states. If we can have a campus that gives people an affordable place to live, that offers dining and other activities right on campus and our headquarters is there, that's the recruiting tool we need to keep growing our headcount in Arizona. It's also an opportunity to bring in industry events and other forms of tourism into the state. We think there's a win-win for everyone. But at the end of the day, just like any company in any state, the politics can sometimes be a hurdle that you have to overcome, and we're working through that, but our patience on this isn't going to last forever, and we're getting more and more serious about looking at other alternatives for our headquarters outside of the state of Arizona.\n\nJason Moser: Got you. Well, speaking of politics, and we're not getting political, so to speak, here, but just bigger picture, clearly, there is this big focus in DC these days on cutting costs, maximizing efficiencies, given the overall opportunity for Axon at the state and the federal level, is this a cause for concern for the leadership team? Is this something y'all are discussing as a source of potential near term headwinds?\n\nJosh Isner: Actually, I think it's going to be a tailwind when all the dust settles for us, I think. What you're seeing is contracts are being canceled that either you're just like, Hey, should we be spending taxpayer money on this? Probably not. Or are we not getting value out of this contract that we're paying a lot for as a government? At Axon's case, actually our products are heavily used. They're valued by our users. They're ones that we think deliver great outcomes for the government, and I think they feel the same way. As some of this money is freed up, I do anticipate there's an opportunity there for more to be spent on military, more to be spent on defense tech and federal law enforcement. I think we're relatively insulated from a lot of the cuts, but actually, these cuts could lead to some opportunity to help in more places.\n\nJason Moser: I guess, same idea, given the international opportunity and all that you're doing there, how concerned are you all in regard to tariffs as it pertains to the near term? Because I tell you, Josh, it seems like every morning we wake up and there's a new headline regarding tariffs and what may or may not happen. It feels like there's a lot of uncertainty out there, and I would imagine that your team is reassessing this on a daily basis.\n\nJosh Isner: Absolutely. One of the things we say a lot internally is, hey, what we value is seeing around corners. We want people to be able to predict what's going to happen into the future. Two or three years ago, between tariffs and some of the uncertainty around China and Taiwan right now, we kicked off a big project to make our supply chain more flexible. We actually feel like we're pretty well positioned regardless of what happens with the tariffs. Our guidance, I don't think would change as a result, as Brittany said on the call yesterday. But our operations team has done a great job with this, Josh Goldman and Eric Hertz at Axon. They've just really gotten out ahead of these issues to where we have multiple suppliers, and we have a lot of raw materials on hand, and we've done all the things to mitigate the really bad outcomes that tariffs could lead to at times for businesses. We're feeling OK about that.\n\nDylan Lewis: Listeners, we love getting company leadership on to help us wade through what's going on with their business. If there's a company you want us to reach out to, let us know, [email protected]. Coming up next, Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger are back with me. Let's talk about the stocks on their radar this week. That's next on Motley Fool Money.\n\nAs always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Fools, we are dive right into stocks on our radar this week as it does every week. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question after you pitch your stock. Jason, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?\n\nJason Moser: One that's probably under the radar for a lot of folks, Marqeta, ticker is M-Q. Marqeta is embedded finance. In simplest terms, they provide tools and APIs that allow its customers to create and issue customized payment cards. I think debit, credit, prepaid, all that good stuff. But those are programs that are specifically designed for the specific business needs. Their customers are companies like Block, Uber, DoorDash, even Alphabet, so they need a big name customers with a lot of folks using those networks. [inaudible] has had a great week, thanks to a strong earnings report and encouraging guidance for the coming year.\n\nAs you can ascertain, Marqeta is in fintech, and so one of the big metrics you follow there is just total processing volume, and that for the quarter clocked in at $80 billion. That represented growth of 29%, net revenue of $136 million and gross profit of $98 million were up 14 and 18% respectively. A big concern, I think, for investors early on with Marqeta story was its reliance on Block as a big customer. That continues to become less and less the case. Block revenue concentration of just 46%. This quarter was down five percentage points from a year ago. One final point, as of note here, seemingly sudden move, but CEO Simon Khalaf has stepped down. And so CFO, Mike Milotich has taken over as the interim CEO until the company finds Khalaf's replacement.\n\nDylan Lewis: Dan, I saw your eyebrows go up there when Jason said embedded finance. I'm curious. We had a question or a comment here on Marqeta, ticker M-Q.\n\nDan Boyd: I know that Jason's always ready to bring us some war on cash-based stocks here. We love to see it. Jason, this stock price has been pretty flat for the last two years. What makes you think that's going to change anytime soon?\n\nJason Moser: Well, they've re established this relationship with Block, and again, they have extended that out several years, so that's some reliability there. Again, with those big customers, I think that makes a big difference, and they continue to grow that total payment volume. It just very impressive rates quarter in and quarter out. Given the trend toward the digital movement in money, I'm encouraged.\n\nDylan Lewis: Matt, what's on your radar this week?\n\nMatt Argersinger: I'm going with EPR Properties, ticker E-P-R. If you don't know EPR, it's an experiential REIT, which means they focus on experience-based products, think restaurants, resorts, fitness centers, water parks, top golf is a big tenet, and Dan, movie theatres. The last time I brought this company up, I'm pretty sure Dan's comment was, movie theaters, are you kidding? The last movie I saw was Cats in 2019, and it was terrible. Well, it turns out you can do pretty well with movie theaters. EPR's results were great. They raised the dividend. Still one of the best bargains in Ratland as well, 7% yield.\n\nDylan Lewis: Dan, are you still anti-movie theaters?\n\nDan Boyd: It's not that I'm anti-movie theaters. It's that I have two young kids and a full time job and no time to go to the movies. Still, Cats, 2019, the last time I was in a theater.\n\nMatt Argersinger: We'll go see Superman this summer. You got to go see that one, I know. Get out of the house.\n\nDan Boyd: We'll go together, Matt, you and I.\n\nDylan Lewis: Sounds like an awesome deal. Dan, Marqeta or EPR, which one's going on your watchlist this week?\n\nDan Boyd: I'm going with Marqeta because fintech, baby. Let's go.\n\nDylan Lewis: Hey, baby. Dan, thanks for weighing in. Jason, Matt, thanks for being here. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money Radio Show. Show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. See you next.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) stock is in an upswing this month with the drugmaker recently announcing plans to invest $27 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint.\n\nThe new investment brings Lilly's total spending on manufacturing expansion to $50 billion since 2020.\n\nThree of the future sites will focus on manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients, re-shoring some of its small molecule chemical synthesis capabilities and strengthening the supply chain. The fourth site will focus on future injectable therapies.\n\nThe planned manufacturing bump follows President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Big Pharma companies that don't re-shore their manufacturing operations.\n\nIt also follows the Food and Drug Administration's decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list. This means compounding pharmacies have had to stop \u2014 or will soon have to stop \u2014 making knockoff versions of the diabetes and weight-loss drug. It also means Lilly will have to keep up with demand for the drugs it sells under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nEli Lilly stock is on a recent run. Shares have surged almost 26% from a low point at 725.01 on Jan. 17 to close at 906.02 on March 4.\n\nSo, is Lilly stock a buy or a sell right now?\n\nEli Lilly Stock: Sales Narrowly Lag\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Eli Lilly earned an adjusted $5.32 per share, soaring 114% and beating calls for $5.02 a share. Sales jumped 45% to $13.53 billion, just below expectations for $13.55 billion, according to FactSet. Despite coming up short, Mounjaro sales rocketed 124%, while Zepbound put up a triple-digit gain after launching in the year-earlier period.\n\nSales of a similar drug, Trulicity, missed expectations and tumbled 26% to $1.25 billion. Trulicity treats type 2 diabetes and, like the tirzepatide-based products, mimics the GLP-1 hormone to improve feelings of satiety and blood sugar markers.\n\nFor the year, Lilly expects $58 billion to $61 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $22.50 to $24 per share. The midpoints of Eli Lilly's outlook topped analysts' forecast. The Street projected $58.77 billion in sales and $22.76 earnings per share.\n\nEli Lilly Stock Analysis\n\nEli Lilly stock retook its 50-day moving average on Jan. 24 and topped its 200-day line on Feb. 6.\n\nShares are forming a cup base with a buy point at 972.53, according to MarketSurge.\n\nShares have an improving Relative Strength Rating of 83 out of a best-possible 99, IBD Digital shows. This puts LLY stock in the top 17% of all stocks when it comes to 12-month performance. The RS Rating was a middling 47 just three months ago.\n\nLilly stock also has a strong Composite Rating of 97, a measure of fundamental and technical metrics.\n\nRecent News Around Lilly Stock\n\nThe race to develop new weight-loss drugs continues to heat up.\n\nIn a recent study, Lilly's Zepbound topped Novo's Wegovy in the first-ever head-to-head study.\n\nParticipants with obesity and one other medical condition \u2014 but not diabetes \u2014 lost up to 20.2% of their body weight over 72 weeks. In comparison, Wegovy recipients lost 13.7% of their body weight. That translated to about 50 pounds and 33 pounds, respectively.\n\nLLY stock fell in July after Pfizer (PFE) and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) announced plans to run additional testing for obesity treatments. A weight-loss treatment study from Roche (RHHBY) also pressured Lilly shares.\n\nLilly is also working on a next-generation weekly shot called retatrutide. While tirzepatide loops in two hormonal targets to stoke weight loss, retatrutide targets three. Its oral weight-loss drug, dubbed orforglipron, is also expected to be the first weight-loss pill to hit the market.\n\nIn other news, Lilly's Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, gained FDA approval in July. It will sell under the brand name Kisunla.\n\nKisunla works by removing a built-up protein called beta amyloid. In testing, Kisunla worked better in patients whose amyloid included a protein called tau. Across all patients, donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 22% to 29% over 18 months. In patients with intermediate levels of tau, donanemab slowed the decline by 35% to 36%.\n\nIt rivals Biogen (BIIB) and Eisai's (ESAIY) Leqembi.\n\nIn the U.K., Kisunla is now approved for patients with one copy of a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease or non-carriers. People with two copies of that mutation are more likely to experience brain swelling as a result amyloid removal.\n\nIs LLY Stock A Buy Or A Sell?\n\nEli Lilly stock isn't a buy\u2014 yet. But shares are setting up nicely, ahead of their key moving averages in a cup base.\n\nNotably, the company is benefitting from its deep investments in the obesity space, having recently won FDA approval for Zepbound as a sleep apnea treatment. Growth remains strong, in double- and triple-digit ranges for its sales and adjusted profit.\n\nIt will be key to watch how the markets for weight-loss drugs and Alzheimer's treatments unfold.\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy and watch, check out IBD Stock Lists.

            "content": "ASHLAND, Ohio \u2013 Ashland University has received a grant of approximately $2.4 million from Lilly Endowment Inc., through its Ministry in Rural Areas and Small Towns Initiative. The aim of the initiative is to provide resources to help churches in rural areas and small towns enhance the vitality of their ministries and strengthen the leadership of the pastors and lay leaders who guide them.\n\n\u201cI am excited for the grant as a significant part of our reach extends into rural and small towns,\u201d said Yvonne Glass, executive dean and associate professor of counseling for Ashland Theological Seminary, which will be home to the new grant-funded project. \u201cOur founding denomination, the Brethren Church, thrives in these places. This grant allows us to have greater impact in preparation of strong, sound, theologically-prepared leaders in the local church.\u201d\n\nAshland Theological Seminary has outlined a comprehensive program, divided into three areas, to utilize the grant. The three areas are pre-seminary programming, seminary-based programming and programming that goes beyond the seminary, with the hopes of increasing youth retention in churches, improving accessibility to theological education and enhancing support for church leaders in rural and small town contexts.\n\nPre-seminary programming targets youth and aims to retain their involvement in the church and community life, while also identifying and nurturing future leaders at an early age. The funding will help expand youth programs, help younger students discern vocation and ministry calls and potentially integrate them into vocational ministry tracks.\n\nThe seminary-based programming focuses on undergraduate and seminary students, specific to student internships, stackable degree options and a Doctor of Ministry cohort. The grants support initiatives to provide practical experiences, reduce financial burdens and increase scholarship and resources for rural-based churches and communities.\n\nThe Lilly Endowment grant will also support a range of continuing education and support programs for pastors and lay leaders, such as micro-credentials, specialty certificates, virtual support groups and workshops.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that these grants will provide much needed resources and support to rural and small town churches to help them address their challenges and enhance and extend the many ways that they serve their communities,\u201d said Christopher L. Coble, Lilly Endowment\u2019s vice president for religion.\n\nAshland University is one of 20 organizations from across the U.S. receiving grants through Lilly Endowment\u2019s Ministry in Rural Areas and Small Towns Initiative, including other colleges and universities, denominational agencies, church networks and parachurch organizations.\n\nLilly Endowment Inc., is an Indianapolis-based private philanthropic foundation created in 1937 by J.K. Lilly, Sr., and his sons Eli and J.K. Jr., through gifts of stock in their pharmaceutical business, Eli Lilly and Company. Although the gifts of stock remain a financial bedrock of the Endowment, it is a separate entity from the company, with a distinct governing board, staff and location. In keeping with the founders\u2019 wishes, the Endowment supports the causes of community development, education and religion and maintains a special commitment to its founders\u2019 hometown, Indianapolis, and home state, Indiana. A primary aim of its grantmaking in religion is to deepen the religious lives of Christians, principally by supporting efforts that enhance congregation vitality and strengthen the leadership of Christian communities. The Endowment also seeks to foster public understanding about religion by encouraging fair, accurate and balanced portrayals of the positive and negative effects of religion on the world and lifting up the contributions that people of all faiths make to our greater civic well-being.",

            "content": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company is ready to shift its manufacturing operations into the U.S. should the need arise. He made the comments at the 45th TD Cowen Annual Health Care Conference in Boston.\n\nSpeaking to analyst Steve Scala on Monday, Bourla explained that Pfizer has 13 production plants in the U.S., \u201cprobably the largest manufacturing network of any other company,\u201d as per a transcript of the event from Seeking Alpha. A few of these facilities \u201care mega, mega sites,\u201d Bourla added, pointing especially to those involved in the production of antibodies and sterile injectables.\n\nSo, \u201cif something happens,\u201d Pfizer will be well-positioned to respond to potential tariffs \u201cby transferring from manufacturing sites outside, to manufacturing sites here the things that can be transferred quickly,\u201d Bourla added.\n\nBourla\u2019s comments on Monday come after he, alongside other Big Pharma CEOs, met with President Donald Trump late last month. When Trump won the election last year, many industry analysts and observers were optimistic, with some analysts raising the possibility of him repealing\u2014or at least toning down\u2014the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)\u2019s drug price negotiation program. Others, meanwhile, said the Trump administration could foster a more industry-friendly environment, particularly regarding dealmaking.\n\nThese hopes seem to have been dashed at the closed-door event, however. Reporting from Bloomberg at the time revealed that Trump threatened the pharma execs with tariffs if they continued to manufacture their drugs and other products abroad. The president also refused to give his word that he\u2019d attempt to water down the IRA.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs play a big part in what analysts at Jefferies call \u201cpolitical uncertainty.\u201d In a note to investors on Monday evening, the firm pointed to the difficult \u201cmacro backdrop\u201d this year so far, which has weighed on the industry. While big companies with solid pipelines\u2014such as Gilead, Amgen and Vertex\u2014will continue to be largely insulated from these factors, small-to-medium players are and will likely face headwinds, according to the analysts.\n\nJust a few days before the meeting, Trump also floated the idea of slapping additional duties of around 25% on imported products, including pharmaceuticals. These levies could \u201cgo very substantially higher over the course of a year,\u201d according to reporting from CNBC.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump also announced tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. Though these additional fines are related to what the White House called the \u201cextraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs\u201d without substantiation, their effects on biopharma could also be profound. Seeking Alpha analyst Edmund Ingham wrote at the time that the China tariffs are especially problematic for the industry, particularly as companies are \u201cincreasingly looking to China to find promising new drug candidates.\u201d\n\nThese tariffs\u201425% on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on goods from China\u2014began March 4.\n\nFollowing these threats, Eli Lilly last week announced that it was making a $27 billion commitment into the U.S., primarily to boost its domestic manufacturing capacity. Lilly will erect four new manufacturing facilities over the next five years, which the company says will in turn will create around 3,000 new jobs for engineers, scientists and other related workers. Construction activities will provide some 10,000 opportunities.",

Fresh off of announcing the \u201clargest rollout of a production plan for our industry in history,\u201d Lilly\u2019s CEO Dave Ricks spoke with the Washington Reporter about his conversations with the Trump administration, the importance of both securing our border and in competing with China, and what the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement looks like.\n\nRicks joined up with senior Trump administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and top Senate Republicans like Sen. Todd Young (R., Ind.) to announce that Lilly is \u201cmore than doubling\u201d its previous $23 billion of investments in America, as first covered by the Reporter.\n\n\u201cImportantly, [we\u2019re] building four new sites in to be determined locations in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the largest single company action ever taken, and will, in total, be $50 billion in nine new factories.\u201d\n\nBeyond pouring tens of billions of dollars directly into America, Ricks said that his company\u2019s \u201cmain priority is to keep our discovery engine rolling, make important medicines, and get them produced at scale.\u201d Ricks added that another priority is \u201cthe renewal of the tax program that was put in place in 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may have noticed that last week that we had a big announcement on production \u2014 we need that corporate tax rate to be competitive with Europe and other jurisdictions to lure that investment back home,\u201d Ricks said.\n\nWhen it comes to Ricks\u2019s industry specifically, he noted that he is \u201creally looking at PBM reform and seeing if we can take down list prices in the U.S. and have a more rational system for consumers, but also for everyone else in the middle of the equation.\n\n\u201cRight now, there's just too much opaque pricing and profit taking,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile many in the pharmaceutical industry were unfamiliar with Trump before his first term, Ricks said the industry is having \u201cvery good\u201d conversations with Trump and with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., this time.\n\n\u201cThe president and the industry got to know each other pretty well in his first term,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn't the case coming in; he obviously was a businessman and a real estate guy. But through COVID and so forth, I think the mutual appreciation grew and we were able to get things done, to get the vaccines approved. So that's carried over, and I think we try to press upon the economic advisors, and the rest of the White House the importance of the industry to our country, not just the economic part, which is significant. We employ over 2 million people and are a meaningful export business, but also for security back home, for the supply chain, for medical products, etc., which is an important issue, and we get into that vis a vis China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Kennedy and with the MAHA movement, at the top level, we have a huge amount of alignment. Everyone in our company wakes up every day trying to make people healthy. So that's important. I think what we need to embrace as an industry is the idea that medicine isn't always the answer. Science tells us that already, so that's easy to embrace. And on the other hand, sometimes lifestyle and prevention isn't enough, and we need medicine. And I think when we've been able to focus on that, there's just a lot of alignment with what Secretary Kennedy is trying to get done, and if we can improve obesity rates, if we improve the health of Americans, that's a powerful mission. We want to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nIn order to combat America\u2019s obesity epidemic, Ricks called for an \u201call of the above strategy,\u201d adding that \u201cto us, it's one of the most important things we could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur job is to make them work with the administration and insurance companies to make [weight loss drugs] more available and at lower cost. And we're committed to do that,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have many more coming.\u201d\n\nLilly\u2019s work in that realm mirrors Trump\u2019s desire to invest in America, with Ricks saying the company is \"making up factories to do this at scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think for the first time in my career, we could say, through lifestyle intervention and medicine, we could make this national crisis, which is driving 40 percent of our health care costs, a distant memory, and that's our goal,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring his interview with the Reporter, Ricks stressed repeated areas of cooperation with the Trump administration and faulted the previous administration for how it allowed an open border that saw untested and unapproved drugs from China and from Mexico to flow into America. Ricks said this issue \u201creally has blossomed and grown in a way that's really quite concerning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Americans know about the fentanyl issues,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThat's the illegal drug, although it's also a prescription drug. And we are now working hard to eliminate the flow of that for the weight loss drugs we make. And just to give you a sense: there may be up to one or two million Americans using these so-called drugs. They're not actually proven. Most of them are sourced out of Chinese labs that aren't even approved in China, let alone in the U.S. And they're injecting these substances into their body. It's a little frightening. Every day we get calls from poison control centers. We test this material often. It's not even close to the medicine we make.\u201d\n\nSecuring the border \u201cand policing the food and drug system is really the job of the federal government. That's one of our asks of the [this] administration,\u201d he said, allowing the problem \u201cto grow\u2026was a huge, huge mistake, and we should stop it, he said.\u201d\n\nBelow is a transcript of our interview with Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks, lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nWhat are your top priorities as Eli Lily CEO as we head into this second Trump term?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nIn general, our priorities are to make medicine for bad diseases, and that's how we create value for people. Right now, it's really a kind of a golden era. I know that's a phrase being used for medical discovery, and one example that is the work we've done in tackling the obesity crisis, another is our work with Alzheimer's disease. There are other targets we have, and so the main priority we have is to keep our discovery engine rolling, make important medicines, and get them produced at scale. Specifically to the U.S. right now, the policy priorities are ones that you'll hear from our industry a lot. One key one for us is the renewal of the tax program that was put in in 2017. You may have noticed that last week that we had a big announcement on production; we need that corporate tax rate to be competitive with Europe and other jurisdictions to lure that investment back home. So that's a key one for me. And then there's one industry one as well, which is really looking at PBM reform and seeing if we can take down list prices in the U.S. and have a more rational system for consumers, but also for everyone else in the middle of the equation. Right now, there's just too much opaque pricing and profit taking. So those are our two top priorities.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nYou just mentioned the $50 billion investment into the American economy. Tell us about what that looked like from your end, and how that happened, and what is that? How does that fit in with the priorities you were just laying out?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nThat's the execution part. Going back to just the first term, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed, and we hadn't built a new facility in the U.S. in 40 years. And the equation changed completely there to get the corporate rate down to 21 percent, maybe even going lower now. It really incentivizes domestic investment and production. So based on the success of Mounjaro and Zepbound, along with other pipeline products, we started construction on a new site just at the end of the first Trump presidency. We're now into our fifth one. By the way, these take about four years to build and be approved and so forth. We have committed so far $23 billion. So last week's announcement was more than doubling that, and importantly, building four new sites in to be determined locations in the U.S. This is the largest rollout of a production plan for our industry in history. This is the largest single company action ever taken, and will, in total, be $50 billion in nine new factories.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nYou have already met with President Trump and with his new Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert Kennedy; tell us about those discussions and what's their reception towards you been?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nI think overall, very good. The president and the industry got to know each other pretty well in his first term. That wasn't the case coming in; he obviously was a businessman and a real estate guy. But through COVID and so forth, I think the mutual appreciation grew and we were able to get things done, to get the vaccines approved. So that's carried over, and I think we try to press upon the economic advisors, and the rest of the White House the importance of the industry to our country, not just the economic part, which is significant. We employ over 2 million people and are a meaningful export business, but also for security back home, for the supply chain, for medical products, etc., which is an important issue, and we get into that vis a vis China. With Kennedy and with the MAHA movement, at the top level, we have a huge amount of alignment. Everyone in our company wakes up every day trying to make people healthy. So that's important. I think what we need to embrace as an industry is the idea that medicine isn't always the answer. Science tells us that already, so that's easy to embrace. And on the other hand, sometimes lifestyle and prevention isn't enough, and we need medicine. And I think when we've been able to focus on that, there's just a lot of alignment with what Secretary Kennedy is trying to get done, and if we can improve obesity rates, if we improve the health of Americans, that's a powerful mission. We want to be a part of that.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nYou were just alluding to the counterfeit drugs and ingredients from who knows where that are still pouring into America from China through Mexico. Can you talk about this from your standpoint as a CEO of pharmaceutical company, and about the damage that this does? What are the concerns here and how can it be stopped?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nIt really has blossomed and grown in a way that's that's really quite concerning. Of course, Americans know about the fentanyl issues. That's the illegal drug, although it's also a prescription drug. And we are now working hard to eliminate the flow of that for the weight loss drugs we make. And just to give you a sense: there may be up to one or two million Americans using these so-called drugs. They're not actually proven. Most of them are sourced out of Chinese labs that aren't even approved in China, let alone in the U.S. And they're injecting these substances into their body. It's a little frightening. Every day we get calls from poison control centers. We test this material often. It's not even close to the medicine we make. This was allowed to grow in the last three years under the last administration. That was a huge, huge mistake, and we should stop it. We're now in a good supply position, which was the loophole used that these guys exploited to profit on Americans, and kind of their lack of knowledge about how the FDA-approved medicines work. But we need help in the government, because controlling the border and policing the food and drug system is really the job of the federal government. That's one of our asks of the incoming administration, too.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nYou had already mentioned the Make America Healthy Again movement that Secretary Kennedy really kicked off. And you mentioned that medicine isn't always the answer, but how do you look at the obesity crisis? From your standpoint, where do you fit in? How can America tackle that?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nTo us, it's one of the most important things we could do. We need an all of the above strategy. We've spoken to the Secretary as well as to others on his team, and that starts with healthy living choices and with food, in particular for children, that area is something that we would support greatly. The science tells us, though, that if people have been overweight or obese for most of their adult life, reducing it without the help of medicine is really difficult for most, so we need a strategy that embraces that as well. Our job is to make them work with the administration and insurance companies to make them more available and at lower cost. And we're committed to do that. And just pointing out here, Lily is the company that invented the best selling one right now. We have many more coming. We're doing this in America. We're making up factories to do this at scale. And I think for the first time in my career, we could say, through lifestyle intervention and medicine, we could make this national crisis, which is driving 40 percent of our health care costs, a distant memory, and that's our goal.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nGiven both Trump's priorities and the priorities that you were laying out, what other opportunities do you see to work with the Trump administration on furthering American pharmaceutical leadership?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nHelping out gaining value abroad is one of the key topics we discussed in our meeting recently. We need to own part of this in industry. Obviously, there's price differences in developed countries from the U.S. And one of the reasons for that is that we're not in a real negotiation there. The government's dictating our price abroad. And often we accept that your choice is to not sell a product. So we need trade tools to overcome that. That's a company to government discussion that we're never going to win, but a government to government discussion, we could win. So that would be a trade policy issue for the incoming U.S. Trade Representative and the White House. We need their help with this. The second is really to embrace the moment right now. As I said, we're in a golden age of medical discovery, but we're sort of in the dark ages of medical reimbursement, and a strategy to change for the better, both life expectancy in our country, but also the trajectory of spending. We're spending way too much on acute diseases that were caused by actions years ago. We need to move to prevention and move to technology, which is both medical technology as well as information technologies, so that people can have the tools to help themselves. I think if we can make that pivot in the next four years, the idea of MAHA or Making America Healthy Again, could be a reality, but we need to also, in addition to talking about the right things to do, we need to move the resources in the system. So that's a big idea, but I think this could be a moment to do that, where we could imagine something like conquering obesity. I think that we have the tools already to do that. We need to just rearrange the resources. We need to have coverage at the national level for employers and the government, and we need to have the prevention strategies. But we're also working on a similar thing for preventing Alzheimer's. Will we embrace that? I don't know. Right now, the easiest thing develop products for or charge the government services for, are acute illness, and that seems like really a mismatch between the goals we should have and where the resources are going.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nI didn't watch the Oscars, but Eli Lilly ran another ad campaign about promoting this healthy skepticism, in the words of the ad, towards these non-FDA approved medicines. Can you talk about that strategy of non-traditional outreach? And what else you think comes next towards that healthy skepticism towards these types of treatments that people are taking?\n\nDave Ricks:\n\nI'm glad you noticed that. Since last year, we really started a corporate campaign to really talk about what the company does at a company level, and take a point of view on controversial issues, but ones we really believe in, and during the Oscars we ran a campaign to talk about the question you asked earlier, which is that people are pursuing improvement in their health, but there's a scientifically-based way to go about developing health products. People should educate themselves on that. And if things seem too good to be true, they probably are. And unfortunately, lots of people are spending time and money online with really questionable things, including, as you mentioned earlier, illegally imported and fake medicine. And so part of the MAHA movement that's interesting is people wanting to take charge of their own decision making in health. And I think what we're saying here is we think that's awesome, that people should investigate. They should read about the science. They should be skeptical about claims that seem over the top or illegitimate, but in doing so, we cannot embrace a world of totally unregulated, non-transparent source of medicines because it's cheap or sounds good. That's not the way. And so in our business, because it's a science process, we're skeptical of everything until proven and repeated results are done in a controlled way. This is the start of educating the public on how science works and why it's great to be a healthy skeptic.\n\nWashington Reporter:\n\nThanks so much for chatting, Dave, and thanks for investing billions in America.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor the best stocks to invest in according to billionaires, we analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings. We selected the 30 best stocks to invest in based on the highest number of billionaire investors, updated as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the aforementioned metrics.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNo. of Billionaire Investors: 23\n\nTotal Value of Billionaire Holdings: $13.74 Billion\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a leading American multinational pharmaceutical company, with a global presence in 18 countries. Its products are distributed in approximately 125 countries, showing its global reach. Eli Lilly and Company aims to pioneer pharmaceutical advancements, as well as focuses on inclusive clinical trials and is committed to ensuring its medicines are both accessible and affordable for diverse populations.\n\nOn February 3, Truist Securities analyst Srikripa Devarakonda increased the price target on LLY shares from $1,029 to $1,038 per share, maintaining a Buy rating on the shares. Devarakonda is optimistic regarding the company\u2019s future on the back of strong Q4 and full-year 2024 results. The company posted Q4 revenue of $13.53 billion, surging 45% year-over-year, and full-year revenue increased 32% compared to 2023. The strong growth was driven by the increased sales volume of Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company\u2019s quarterly earnings per share more than doubled, rising 114% to $5.32 per share.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stays on the growth trajectory and projects 2025 revenue between $58 billion and $61 billion, reflecting a 32% year-over-year increase. LLY estimates EPS in the range of $22.05 to $23.55, reinforcing confidence in its financial trajectory and continued innovation.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 11th on our list of the best stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company said it wants consumers to be more discerning when considering treatments, especially if the drugs aren\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (MM+M is PRWeek's sister business media outlet at Haymarket Media).\n\n\u201cWe are referring to both compounded products and any products that are marketed like medicine, reference medicine and even sound like medicine, but are not held to the same scientific standards or safety measures as tested, trialed and approved medicine,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe print ads claim that \u201cskepticism is essential to making medicine,\u201d underscoring that questioning whether a drug actually works is how drugmakers gain peer-reviewed proof that a medicine is safe and effective.\n\nLilly also unveiled a film that plays on the skepticism theme, noting that consumers should be cautious even when family, friends and podcast hosts peddle unapproved or non-traditional medications.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re feeling a little big? Anxious? Tired? I know just the thing. It\u2019s all natural,\u201d the narrator notes in the video. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a prescription, and those government regulators have no hand in it. They don\u2019t even want you to know.\u201d The film questions those claims, arguing that \u201creal medicine doesn\u2019t need your faith.\u201d\n\nThe marketing push underscores Lilly\u2019s efforts to define itself as a reliable developer and distributor of its approved weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, by contrasting them with compounded GLP-1s that are not regulated by the FDA.\n\n\u201cRather than comply with the law, compounders have raised nearly identical, meritless challenges to FDA\u2019s decisions resolving the tirzepatide and semaglutide shortages, all to continue profiting from the mass production of risky unapproved knockoffs that threaten the health and safety of Americans,\u201d Lilly said in a statement.\n\nThe ads direct consumers to a page on Lilly\u2019s website dedicated to \u201ccounterfeit, fake and unsafe or untested compounded products,\u201d where people can check the authenticity of their medications.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Novo Nordisk launched its own print ad in response to Hims & Hers\u2019 compounded GLP-1 ad at Super Bowl LIV. Novo\u2019s ad was underscored by a tagline urging consumers to \u201ccheck before you inject.\u201d\n\nCompounding battles\n\nThe campaigns from both Lilly and Novo rolled out amid the battle between the Big Pharma companies and compounded GLP-1 providers.\n\nCompounding pharmacies and telehealth platforms have offered compounded versions of GLP-1s since the FDA listed Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, as well as Novo\u2019s semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, in shortage.\n\nAccording to the FDA, compounding pharmacies are permitted to sell compounded drugs in certain cases, such as when a patient can\u2019t be treated with an FDA-approved drug or when the drug is in shortage. The agency notes on its website that compounded drugs should only be used in those limited scenarios because unnecessary use \u201cmay expose patients to potentially serious health risks.\u201d\n\nHowever, compounding pharmacies and telehealth platforms like Hims & Hers, which spent millions of dollars on that Super Bowl ad, have argued that their medications are safe and effective.\n\n\u201c[T]hese medications are prepared by state-licensed compounding pharmacies or FDA-registered outsourcing facilities to meet specific patient needs when commercially available options are unavailable or unsuitable,\u201d compounding trade group, Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, said in a statement this month.\n\nCompounded drugs are \u201cstill subject to state board of pharmacy oversight and must comply with USP compounding standards and Sections 503A and 503B of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,\u201d APC continued.\n\nChanges at the federal level have had a cascading effect on compounders and their dynamic with drugmakers like Lilly and Novo. Earlier this month, the FDA officially took semaglutide off the shortage list, giving compounding providers up to 90 days to remove their products from the market in what could potentially spell the end of the saga.\n\nThose in support of compounded GLP-1s aren\u2019t giving up without a fight. Compounding industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association has since launched a lawsuit against the FDA over the decision, arguing it was \u201creckless and arbitrary.\u201d\n\nBoth Lilly and Novo have initiated lawsuits against med spas and other providers of compounded GLP-1s over the past few years.\n\nThis story first appeared on MM+M.",

Our confidence positions us to help reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, benefiting hard-working American families and increasing exports of medicines made in the USA.\n\nThe fourth facility will expand the company\u2019s global parenteral manufacturing network to support the production of future injectable therapies\n\nAdditionally, the new facilities are expected to create over 3,000 jobs for highly skilled workers, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel, and lab technicians.\n\nThe development of these sites could also generate nearly 10,000 construction jobs.\n\nEdgardo Hernandez, Executive VP and President of Lilly Manufacturing Operations, said: \u201cTo deliver on our big bets on next-generation modalities like small molecules, biologics, and nucleic acid therapies, Lilly is investing in the state-of-the-art manufacturing infrastructure needed to deliver tomorrow's safe and reliable medicines.\n\n\u201cWe are not just building facilities. We are creating a future where British innovation leads the world in pharmaceutical manufacturing, requiring a highly skilled workforce prepared to shape the future of healthcare.\u201d\n\nBeyond job creation, these new sites are expected to bring economic benefits to their local communities, including increased local spending, tax revenue, economic diversification, improved infrastructure, population growth, and workforce training opportunities.",

            "content": "AbbVie on Monday jumped into the hot weight-loss space, looking to gain ground on its Big Pharma peers, with a licensing deal with Danish company Gubra that aims to bring a long-acting amylin drug to the market.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, AbbVie will front $350 million and put up to $1.875 billion on the line for development, commercial and sales milestones. Gubra, a service provider for pre-clinical research and peptide-based drug discovery, will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales of GUB014295, the asset at the center of Monday\u2019s partnership.\n\nDesigned to be administered via an injection under the skin, GUB014295 is a long-acting analog of the amylin hormone, which acts on corresponding receptors to elicit feelings of satiety and suppress appetite, in turn lowering the overall intake of food. Amylin agonists such as GUB014295 also exert an inhibitory effect on the gastrointestinal system, helping to slow the emptying of the stomach, according to AbbVie\u2019s press announcement.\n\nThe current obesity landscape is dominated by GLP-1 medicines like Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide brands Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide franchise of Mounjaro and Zepbound. But recently, more and more companies have been looking to amylin agents as an alternative weight-loss treatment.\n\nAccording to a December 2024 note from Leerink Partners, which called amylin the \u201chottest new mechanism for obesity,\u201d targeting this pathway could potentially improve the quality of weight loss, with greater reductions in fat instead of lean muscle. Amylin agonists could also be safer and more tolerable than GLP-1 drugs, the analysts said.\n\nAt the forefront of the amylin push is Novo, which is advancing CagriSema, a combo regimen of its semaglutide, with the long-acting amylin drug cagrilintide. Late last year, however, the pharma unveiled Phase III data for CagriSema, baring an efficacy estimate that fell below its own prior projections and sending its shares crashing 20%. The readout wiped some $72 billion off Novo\u2019s market cap.\n\nFellow obesity leader Eli Lilly is also working on its own set of amylin programs, of which the mid-stage eloralintide is closest to the market. The pharma is testing a combination of the amylin drug eloralintide with tirzepatide in participants with obesity but without diabetes, for which data is expected in mid-2025. Eloralintide is also being assessed in patients with obesity and overweight with type 2 diabetes.\n\nSeveral other biopharma players are advancing their own amylin hopefuls, including Zealand Pharma and AstraZeneca.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nAbbVie is joining the industry\u2019s rush to develop new obesity medicines, announcing Monday a deal with Denmark-based Gubra to license a drug that could compete with experimental therapies being developed by Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Zealand Pharma.\n\nPer deal terms, AbbVie will pay Gubra $350 million up front and offer up to $1.9 billion in additional payments tied to the achievement of development and sales milestones. AbbVie will assume responsibility for development and commercialization.\n\nGubra is developing a type of drug called an amylin analog that regulates appetite and blood sugar levels. If successful, these drugs could be used as alternatives to or in combination with marketed drugs like Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to increase weight loss or reduce side effects.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly and Novo have a significant lead on the obesity field, as they market the only two blockbuster drugs proven in testing to result in double-digit percentage weight loss. But those GLP-1 drugs have drawbacks, including side effects like nausea and vomiting in many people who take the once-weekly shots. They also have high discontinuation rates due to those side effects as well as their costs.\n\nThose shortcomings, along with the draw of a market forecast to exceed $100 billion annually by the 2030s, have energized obesity drug research and dealmaking. Even companies like AbbVie and Amgen that don\u2019t have a long track record in metabolic drugs are getting involved.\n\nAbbVie found an attractive deal with Gubra, which is developing an agent it calls GUB014295 or GUBamy. The experimental drug has completed a Phase 1 dosing trial in men considered lean or overweight by body-mass index. Trial volunteers who received the highest dose lost an average of 3% of their body weight over six weeks.\n\nAn additional dosing trial is underway, with results from various parts of that study due to be available throughout 2025.\n\nAt this stage of development, Gubra\u2019s candidate is around a year and a half behind Zealand, which has an amylin-targeting drug in a Phase 2 trial due to read out in 2026, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Prakhar Agrawal wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNovo, meanwhile, already has Phase 3 data on its amylin drug cagrilintide, which was assessed in a trial alone and as part of a combination with Wegovy called CagriSema. Lilly has an amylin drug in Phase 2, and AstraZeneca and Metsera are developing similar agents.\n\nWhile the Gubra trial results so far suggest the drug is active, Agrawal added that it\u2019s \u201chard to know whether it\u2019s differentiated in any way.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gubra developed its drug to be more stable than other amylin-targeting drugs, Agrawal wrote. Those drugs commonly undergo a chemical reaction called \u201cfibrillation\u201d that can reduce potency, raise the risk of side effects and affect quality.",

            "content": "The R&D World Index saw a slight gain of 0.22% last week, closing at 4,163.38 points. Corporate actions focused heavily on new manufacturing investments, with Apple doubling its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and Eli Lilly announcing plans for four new U.S. drug manufacturing plants. Technology companies continued their push in advanced computing, with Amazon and Google making significant moves in quantum computing and AI services. Meanwhile, global R&D center expansions continued with new facilities announced in Indonesia, Qatar, and China.\n\nTech & manufacturing\n\n1. Apple doubles Advanced Manufacturing Fund for U.S. expansion\n\nRDW Index member Apple, Cupertino, California, announced last week that it will double its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to drive technological advancements in Texas. The investment will support advances in artificial intelligence (AI), silicon engineering, and workforce development. As part of this investment, Apple will build a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas (opening in 2026), to manufacture servers supporting Apple Intelligence. This personal intelligence system helps users with writing, self-expression, and productivity. The company will also open an academy in Michigan to help train the next generation of manufacturers. The company said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, hire 20,000 new employees over that period (with most new positions focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, AI, and machine learning), and support 24 U.S. factories producing silicon for new Apple products. The company also plans to increase data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada. The company also plans to invest in manufacturing advanced silicon devices at TSMC Fab 21 (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) in Arizona. Apple is TSMC Fab 21\u2019s largest customer and supports more than 2,000 chip production workers in the U.S.\n\n2. Apple establishes first Asian R&D software center in Indonesia\n\nIn other Apple news, the tech company announced last week that it plans to establish an R&D center in Jakarta, Indonesia, the first Asian country to have an Apple R&D software center. This R&D center represents an Apple investment of about $150 million, giving the company a Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certificate valid for 2023 to 2028. It will be the basis for Apple\u2019s marketing of its products, including its iPhone 16 in Indonesia.\n\n3. Amazon unveils first quantum computing chip\n\n4. Google offers expanded free tier of AI coding assistance\n\nAmazon.com announced last week the unveiling of its first quantum computing chip, Ocelot. According to Amazon, the chip can supposedly lower the costs of reducing errors by up to 90%. This announcement comes just a week after Microsoft claimed a quantum computing breakthrough by creating a new state of matter. Alphabet/Google also said it developed a new chip called Willow in December 2024, which marked an advance in solving quantum computing\u2019s error correction issues.\n\nGoogle, Mountain View, California, also announced last week that it is adding a free tier of its Gemini Code Assist service that includes 180,000 snippets of AI-generated code per month, which is roughly 90 times what Google\u2019s competitors are offering. This is being done to help Google catch up to Microsoft in a growing business for AI providers. Google was slower than its competitors in releasing an AI coding tool and hoped its free usage limits would lure new customers. More than a quarter of Google\u2019s new code is now AI-generated.\n\nGlobal R&D expansion\n\n5. Energy X opens R&D center in Qatar\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s AI-driven software firm, Energy X, announced last week that it is opening an R&D center in Qatar, as it plans a significant expansion into the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, where it plans to invest more than $100 million over the next five years. Qatar is renowned for its advanced R&D and innovation ecosystem, according to Energy X. The company aims to strengthen its research capabilities in Qatar and unveil cutting-edge technologies for its self-sufficient buildings. Talks regarding their registration and licensing are already in the advanced stages with the Qatar Financial Centre.\n\n6. Hyundai establishes AI-focused subsidiary in Shanghai\n\nAutomaker Hyundai, Seoul, South Korea, announced last week that it has established a subsidiary in Shanghai, China, CoMo, that is focused on AI-based R&D as it steps up its development of software-defined vehicles for China\u2019s large automobile marketplace. The company plans for CoMo to focus on AI-based solutions for autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT). CoMo looks to align Hyundai\u2019s new product development with Shanghai\u2019s plans to build a smart transport ecosystem, including software-defined vehicles. The city is expanding its autonomous driving infrastructure and has recently opened 2,200 km of its roads for autonomous driving tests.\n\nHealthcare & pharmaceuticals\n\n7. Eli Lilly announces four new U.S. manufacturing plants\n\nDrug maker and RDW Index member Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, announced last week that it plans to build four new drug manufacturing plants in the U.S., a $27 billion investment that the company expects will create more than 3,000 highly skilled jobs and employ 10,000 construction workers. Three new sites will produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for its drugs, while the fourth will produce sterile injectable medicines, such as Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro diabetes drug. The company has not finalized the sites for these plants but expects them to be making drugs within five years. Lilly and other pharma companies hope their actions for building domestic plants will entice the Trump administration to extend the corporate tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration. Lilly had not constructed a new manufacturing plant in the U.S. in 40 years, so it hopes this action will be rewarded.\n\nThe R&D World Index\n\nR&D World\u2019s R&D Index is a weekly stock market summary of the top international companies involved in R&D. The top 25 industrial R&D spenders in 2020 were selected based on the latest listings from Schonfeld & Associates\u2019 June 2020 R&D Ratios & Budgets. These 25 companies include pharmaceutical (10 companies), automotive (6 companies), and ICT (9 companies), which invested a cumulative total of nearly 260 billion dollars in R&D in 2019, or approximately 10% of all the R&D spending in the world by government, industries, and academia combined, according to R&D World\u2019s 2021 Global R&D Funding Forecast.

            "content": "It's hard to argue with the kinds of results Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) has produced over the past five years. The company has been one of the best-performing pharmaceutical giants, with its shares leaving the broader market in the dust.\n\nSome might argue that it's too late for investors to get in on Eli Lilly, while others could feel that its work in the diabetes and obesity markets still makes it an attractive long-term option. Which side is right? Let's figure out how Lilly could perform through the end of the decade, and decide whether it's still worth investing in the stock.\n\nExpect strong revenue growth throughout\n\nFirst, let's consider how Eli Lilly's newest products will affect its performance in the next half-decade. These new medicines include Alzheimer's disease treatment Kisunla, ulcerative colitis medication Omvoh, and cancer drug Jaypirca.\n\nOf course, Lilly's most important new products are diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight management medicine Zepbound, which share the active ingredient tirzepatide. In 2024, Eli Lilly's revenue increased by 32% year over year to $45 billion. The tirzepatide franchise contributed about $16.5 billion -- despite having been on the market for less than three years.\n\nAnalysts have predicted peak annual sales of $25 billion for this compound. They may have been lowballing it. I expect Zepbound and Mounjaro to continue on their upward trajectory through 2030, although increased competition will probably lead to their delivering less impressive sales growth.\n\nHowever, the other medicines in Lilly's new portfolio, which aren't yet contributing much, will rise in prominence. Consider Kisunla, which fills a significant need in treating Alzheimer's disease. According to some estimates, it could generate about $2.5 billion in revenue by 2030. Jaypirca and Omvoh should also contribute meaningfully through the end of the decade.\n\nIn other words, Eli Lilly's revenue should continue growing at a good clip. The midpoint of the company's guidance for 2025 implies sales growth of about 32% for the year, a terrific performance for a pharmaceutical giant. I'd be surprised if its annual top-line growth goes lower than 15% in any year through 2030.\n\nThere will be solid pipeline progress\n\nEli Lilly has several exciting products in its pipeline, some of which are likely to earn approval in the next five years. Consider two of the company's leading candidates in weight loss: orforglipron and retatrutide. Both medicines are in phase 3 studies, but not just as weight loss management products: They're being developed as potential therapies for diabetes, sleep apnea, and several other conditions.\n\nWhat makes them so promising? Consider retatrutide, a triple agonist -- it mimics the action of three hormones: GLP-1, GIP, and GCG. That could be an improvement on even tirzepatide, which mimics GLP-1 and GIP. Tirzepatide was the first of its kind. Retatrutide still has to prove its worth in clinical trials.\n\nThe point is that Lilly's pipeline in the increasingly competitive GLP-1 market looks stronger than that of any of its peers not named Novo Nordisk. According to some estimates, retatrutide could generate $5 billion by 2030, while orforglipron might reach $8.3 billion in sales by then.\n\nNaturally, other new Lilly products could see the light of day by 2030, and others will progress to late-stage studies. That could be the case for the drugmaker's highly promising investigational gene therapy for deafness. Furthermore, many of its existing products will likely earn label expansions. The lineup should look even stronger by the end of the decade.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nBears might point out Eli Lilly's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 39.\n\nThe healthcare industry's average is 17.7 as of this writing. If Lilly is overvalued right now, it might underperform broader equities in the medium term. Would it be best for investors to wait for a better entry point?\n\nMy view is that the stock is fairly valued. Lilly's revenue and earnings have been growing much faster than those of most of its similarly sized peers in the healthcare industry, so it only makes sense that it has a higher forward P/E.\n\nI expect Eli Lilly to beat the market through the next five years. Beyond that, considering its incredible innovative abilities, it will still be an excellent stock.",

Could the high cost of hugely popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy be coming down in the near future? Cheddar\n\nMany Americans have turned to compounding pharmacies to get popular weight-loss drugs due to lack of availability or expensive retail price tags. But this option will soon close for consumers.\n\nThe federal government allows compounding pharmacies to sell copies of drugs when the medications are in short supply. Yet federal regulators recently declared the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Zepbound are no longer in shortage. That means consumers who use telehealth companies or medical spas to get less expensive, compounded versions will need to get their medications elsewhere.\n\nThat has panicked consumers such as Amanda Bonello, a Marion, Iowa, mother of three, who worries the supply cutoff will force her to buy the brand-name version of a drug she can't afford. She takes a compounded version of tirzepatide, Eli Lilly's drug sold under the name Mounjaro to treat diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The average retail price for Zepbound is nearly $1,300, according to GoodRx, a prescription drug discount provider.\n\n\"It leaves me up a creek without a paddle,\" Bonello said. \"It feels like we're all on an island and Big Pharma has the only food source, and they're letting everyone who can't afford it starve.\"\n\nIndustry groups that represent compounding pharmacies and suppliers have sued to continue selling these drugs. And patients have started an online petition to extend the time in which they can use compounded GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1, medications. Alternatively, the petition requests the Food and Drug Administration authorize generic versions or encourage drugmakers to lower retail prices. The petition also seeks to compel health insurers to cover these drugs.\n\nWhat's status of compounded Wegovy and Zepbound?\n\nCompounding suppliers and pharmacies will soon no longer be allowed to make and sell weight-loss drugs for the mass market. The federal government has authorized a transition period that's already partly closed for compounded versions of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Consumers will have a bit longer to get compounded semaglutide, which is sold under the brands Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for diabetes.\n\nIn December, the FDA declared Eli Lilly's tirzepatide was no longer in short supply. The FDA said pharmacies had until Feb. 18 to discontinue compounding, distributing or dispensing tirzepatide. Suppliers that produce batches of the drug and sell to others have until March 19 to cease distribution. The industry trade group Outsourcing Facilities Association sued the FDA in U.S. District Court in Texas and filed a motion seeking to delay such enforcement.\n\nIn a legal response to the industry trade group's motion, the FDA urged the court to reject the group's request. The agency argues rejecting the request would \"maximize patient safety\" and adhere to Congress' intent to incentivize drug development while allowing compounding during temporary drug shortages.\n\nLast month, the FDA said the shortage of shortage of Novo Nordisk's semaglutide is over. Pharmacies must cease selling compounded semaglutide by April 22. Facilities that supply compounded semaglutide injections must cease distributing the drug by May 22.\n\nI take compounded weight-loss drugs: What will my doctor or pharmacist tell me?\n\nPharmacists who supply compounded weight-loss and diabetes drugs already are discussing the situation with customers. Some aren't refilling prescriptions. Others don't want to start new customers on the compounded medications because they'll soon need to switch to brand-name medications.\n\nWithin a year of discontinuing semaglutide, a group of 327 patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan regained two-thirds of weight lost while on the medication, one study found. The study also said the patients were less healthy than they were while on the medication.\n\nJennifer Burch, who runs an independent compounding pharmacy in North Carolina, said she informs all her patients about how compounded drugs are available only when a brand name is on the FDA's shortage list.\n\nShe fields questions from people who are interested in starting on compounded tirzepatide. With the drug shortage ending, she advises patients to not start taking compounded drugs if they won't be able to access or afford the brand-name drugs.\n\n\"We try to make sure they know that up front,\" said Burch, who is president of the Pharmacy Compounding Foundation. \"We don't want to pull the rug out from under them.\"\n\nBurch added some patients want doctors to write longer-term prescriptions so they can stockpile the compounded medication for up to one year. But doctors are reluctant to do that because they must monitor patients' weight loss and overall health while on the medication, she said.\n\n\"I had a provider yesterday who said, 'I'm really scared to write 12 months for a patient. They'll come back to me and they'll weigh 100 pounds. That's not really what I want,'\" Burch said.\n\nThe industry group Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding urged the FDA to approve the transition period for people taking compounded weight-loss medications to give them time to prepare for such as change, said CEO Scott Brunner.\n\nBrunner said patients often must go back to their doctor or telehealth provider and get a new prescription for their weight-loss medications. This transition period gives pharmacies enough time to prepare for the change without abruptly changing patients' prescriptions.\n\n\"This is all about continuation of care, assuring patients don't experience some interruption of therapy,\" Brunner said. \"Abruptly ending these GLP-1 drugs can have potential health consequences.\"\n\nWhat's being done to make brand-name versions of weight-loss drugs more affordable?\n\nMost large companies that provide health insurance benefits for workers and private insurance companies cover diabetes drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro.\n\nBut a survey last year by the benefits consultant Mercer said less than half of large employers covered GLP-1 drugs for obesity. That means consumers often face large bills for drugs that retail for about $1,300 per month, before rebates or discounts.\n\nWhile Congress has scrutinized pharmaceutical companies over the retail price of these medications, drugmakers have rolled out some discounted, direct-to-consumer options.\n\nLast week, Eli Lilly slashed the monthly price for lower-dosage vials of Zepbound by $50 for consumers who pay cash via the drugmaker's LillyDirect website. Consumers who buy a month's supply of 2.5 mg vials will pay $349 and 5 mg vials will cost $499. Lilly also announced higher dosages of 7.5 mg and 10 mg at monthly prices of $599 and $699 respectively. Those higher dosage prices will be discounted to $499 per month for the first fill, as well as refills within 45 days.\n\nMeanwhile, drug compounders are still pressing legal challenges to the FDA's decision to declare the weight-loss drug shortages over. The Outsourcing Facilities Association sued the FDA on Monday over its decision to declare Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic are no longer in shortage. The industry group earlier sued the agency over declaration that Lilly's tirzepatide was no longer in short supply.\n\nIn the tirzepatide lawsuit, the OFA filed a motion arguing the FDA's shortage decision was effectively a new rule that requires a more comprehensive regulatory process. A federal judge has not yet ruled on the motion. The FDA said it won't enforce its Feb. 18 deadline for compounding pharmacies to discontinue the drug until the court rules on the motion.\n\nAfter the FDA declared the tirzepatide shortage over, Bonello said she planned to ask her doctor to switch her to compounded semaglutide. Now, she realizes that's not a lasting solution, either.\n\nHer workplace insurance plan covers GLP-1 diabetes medications but it doesn't cover weight-loss medications. Although she has elevated blood sugar, she doesn't have diabetes, even though other family members have been diagnosed.\n\nEven with Lilly's discounted price of $499 for the higher dosages announced this week, Bonello said she can't afford that amount and still pay daily living expenses.\n\n\"That's more than my phone bill and car insurance combined,\" she said.",

            "content": "William Howard Cordell Jr., M.D., 73 years old, passed away peacefully Sunday, March 2nd, 2025, at home surrounded by family following an extended illness. William is survived by his wife Terri Cordell, son Corey Cordell (Caroline), two grandchildren - Nicholas and Julia Cordell, and his brother, James Cordell (Betsy), his nephew Will Cordell (Madeline), and his loving nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his father, William Howard Cordell Sr., and his mother, Carrie Marie Cordell.\n\nWilliam, lovingly known as Bill (among many other nicknames), was a creative and compassionate physician, husband, and father. He enjoyed teaching, mentoring, and entertaining everyone who knew him, including the residents, nurses, and fellow doctors during his time in the Emergency Department. Bill never failed to add his witty and quick sense of humor. He loved exploring and trying new experiences with his family and grandchildren.\n\nBill graduated from Broad Ripple High School in 1969 and continued on to pursue a degree in medicine from IU School of Medicine in 1977. Bill worked 25 years at Methodist Hospital in the Emergency Medicine and Trauma Center as a clinical physician and research director. He was involved with the startup of many new medical advances, including the beginning of LifeLine Helicopter. In 2002, he became a research scientist at Eli Lilly and remained there until his retirement.\n\nBill had a passion for art and music and enjoyed playing the piano, synthesizer, and keyboards. He helped form a band called the Cousins from Venus, and his stage name was Mr. Peabody. They played regular gigs at the Vogue, Patio, weddings, and parties. Beyond music, his love of art was often seen in small comic-style sketches, which often highlighted his witty sense of humor.\n\nBill loved his family and enjoyed numerous vacations spent with them, especially on the most recent family Disney Cruise vacation. He loved spending time with his grandchildren. In his spare time, Bill was an avid reader and enjoyed watching movies, especially those pertaining to World War II history. He had a special place in his heart for historical airplanes like the B-17, B-25, and specifically the B-24 Liberator because of his Uncle Homer.\n\nFuneral arrangements are at Indiana Funeral Care on Wednesday, March 19th, 2025, from 2-4 pm, with a prayer service from 4-5 pm. A Celebration of Life will follow at George\u2019s Neighborhood Grill at 6 pm.

(NASDAQ: BIOA) and certain of its senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in BioAge, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nInvestors have until March 10, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of investors who purchased stock pursuant and/or traceable to BioAge\u2019s registration statement for its initial public offering held on or about September 26, 2024. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Soto v. BioAge Labs, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-196.\n\nWhy was BioAge Sued under the Federal Securities Laws?\n\nBioAge Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of therapeutic products for metabolic diseases, with a primary focus on obesity. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, azelaprag, is an orally available small-molecule agonist of the apelin receptor (APJ), designed to enhance weight loss.\n\nAs alleged, BioAge\u2019s IPO documents discussed its ongoing STRIDES Phase 2 trial of azelaprag in combination with GLP-1R agonists for enhanced weight loss. BioAge stated that it was collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cLilly\u201d) in connection with STRIDES, and that Lilly would be advising and assisting on all aspects of the trial\u2019s design and execution. BioAge also stated that it anticipated topline results in Q3 2025 and discussed the potential for a second Phase 2 clinical trial. As alleged, BioAge\u2019s statements conveyed to investors that there were no safety concerns and that it expected top line results to meet its primary endpoint goals.\n\nIn truth, BioAge was forced to discontinue the STRIDES Phase 2 trial after several subjects exhibited elevated liver enzyme levels, indicating potential organ damage. Consequently, the Company terminated the trial and ceased further enrollment.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn December 6, 2024, BioAge announced that it discontinued its STRIDES Phase 2 trial for azelaprag, citing safety concerns, after liver transaminitis was observed in subjects receiving azelaprag. The Company stated that the decision to discontinue the STRIDES trial of azelaprag \u201cbecame clear\u201d due to \u201cthe emerging safety profile of the current doses tested[.]\u201d This news caused the price of BioAge stock to decline over 76%, from a closing price of $20.09 per share on December 6, 2024, to $4.65 per share on December 9, 2024.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in BioAge you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts on the US government and how action against smaller agencies such as USAID can translate into action against larger agencies and programs.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\"But I do think that when the Defense Department is on the [inaudible], and then Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, Medicare, Medicaid, I don't know a soul who thinks that there isn't fat in there. And I also think that, kind of like the labor department, with the unemployment number we really don't know what it is we have big revisions, if we had, if we gave to Salesforce, I don't know. . .I think that, if we gave these companies, literally outsourced these companies, I know people are going to say, Jim you are like, that is so right wing, but if there's, the machines are better. . \"\n\nCramer also commented on recent Bitcoin price action which saw the cryptocurrency dip below the $90,000 mark. He linked Bitcoin as being a \"proxy for the fact that we have thirty-six trillion in debt.\" Cramer also wondered how much of the gain in Bitcoin's price was due to Michael Saylor's firm adding the currency to its balance sheet.\n\nCramer added that his team has concluded that so much of the \"froth\" in the market in untested areas such as quantum computing came from Bitcoin. He outlined: \"The reason why we've had so much froth . . .we think that Bitcoin got people very excited about things that are space age and that the fundament of speculation is Bitcoin. That's what turned it all on.\"\n\nAnother topic that caught the CNBC TV host's attention was the mergers and acquisition environment in the Trump administration. After the President's election victory in November, investors were ecstatic as they believed that the new administration could create a healthy environment for deals. Commenting on how the rules of the market still remained the same, Cramer outlined:",

(Even though experts widely acknowledge that plant-based meat would, in fact, better help feed a growing population, as it requires less land and water and generates far less greenhouse gas emissions than animal meat.)\n\nBut take a closer look at Elanco, and Simmons\u2019s opposition isn\u2019t all that surprising. The company he runs, which spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in 2019, is a world leader in developing and marketing pharmaceuticals \u2014 including antibiotics and vaccines \u2014 for both pets and livestock.\n\nIn the US, nearly all meat, milk, and eggs come from factory farms, which are prone to being overcrowded, stressful, disease-ridden environments where animals are especially susceptible to infections. Products from companies like Elanco are integral to preventing and treating those inevitable infections, serving an essential role in industrial animal agriculture.\n\nPigs at a factory farm in North Carolina.

Rudy Malmquist\n\nIf plant-based meat were ever to displace some of the conventional meat supply, it would mean fewer factory-farmed animals, and thus less profit for Elanco.\n\n\u201cAlternatives to animal-derived protein,\u201d among other things, the company wrote in a 2019 financial report, \u201ccould negatively affect the market for our products.\u201d\n\nIn the press and on social media, Simmons has also exaggerated the potential of technology to slash livestock emissions. In 2021, he claimed \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that some cattle operations could reach net zero emissions within a decade, and that we shouldn\u2019t expend energy on changing people\u2019s diets to fight climate change. That flies in the face of consensus from climate scientists and agriculture experts, who, in a 2021 survey, overwhelmingly agreed that rich- and middle-income countries need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, which currently account for about 15 to 20 percent of global emissions, and that slashing meat and dairy consumption is the most effective way to do it.\n\nOn conference stages, Simmons has criticized Bill Gates\u2019s bullish support for meat alternatives and a Chipotle marketing campaign critical of factory farming, while another Elanco executive criticized raising animal welfare standards for chickens.\n\nElanco declined an interview request for this story and didn\u2019t respond to a list of detailed questions. \u201cFor 70 years, Elanco has pioneered ways to improve animal health and wellbeing and raise livestock more sustainably,\u201d the company wrote in a statement to Vox. \u201cWe work alongside farmers and veterinarians to bring forward leading innovations in nutrition and diet management, digestion optimization as well as on-farm sustainability solutions.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s work can be thought of as part of the \u201canimal-industrial complex\u201d \u2014 a network of companies, governments, and public and private research centers that, according to sociologist Richard Twine at Edge Hill University in the UK, make up the factory farm system, promote its continued existence and expansion, and defend it from criticism.\n\nJeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco Animal Health Inc., center, applauds while ringing the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of effort being put into protecting business as usual,\u201d Twine said.\n\nThat animal-industrial complex encompasses meat, milk, and egg companies and their trade associations, pharmaceutical companies like Elanco, genetics companies that breed farm animals to grow bigger and faster, and the seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment companies involved in growing animal feed. It also includes public institutions, such as industry-friendly agencies like the US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration, and even land-grant universities that receive funding from and partner with the meat industry on its research priorities.\n\nThe entities within this ecosystem work to boost meat production and sales, shape public policy, and amplify messaging that improves consumer perception of animal products. Both money and personnel flow between the different players.\n\nElanco, for example, sponsors meat industry conferences and awards, funds livestock industry groups and serves on their boards, and has published research with industry-friendly academics claiming that US dairy farming can achieve \u201cclimate neutrality.\u201d\n\nElanco isn\u2019t alone. Merck Animal Health \u2014 a division of Merck, one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies \u2014 and Zoetis, which in 2013 spun off from the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, engage in some of the same activities, like sponsoring meat industry conferences.\n\nZoetis didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and Merck Animal Health declined an interview request. The Animal Health Institute, a trade group that represents the animal pharmaceutical industry, didn\u2019t respond to a list of detailed questions about the industry and pointed me to progress reports from the intergovernmental World Organization for Animal Health and the trade group HealthforAnimals.\n\nProcessing Meat A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

That system helped make meat, milk, and eggs more affordable and abundant, and lower their per-pound carbon footprint.\n\nBut it also has contributed to serious animal welfare, environmental, and public health concerns, including antimicrobial-resistant germs or \u201csuperbugs,\u201d which adapt and build resilience against the antibiotics laced in farmed animals\u2019 feed and water. When these germs escape the farm and infect humans, antibiotics are ineffective at treating them, which can make common ailments difficult or even impossible to heal. Heavy antibiotic use in livestock, along with overuse of antibiotics in humans, is a significant driver of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, which killed over one million people worldwide in 2019 and played a role in an additional 4.95 million deaths.\n\nAround 70 percent of antibiotics important in human medicine are fed to farmed animals, both in the US and globally. The World Health Organization has called for significant reductions and considers antimicrobial resistance \u201cone of the top global public health and development threats.\u201d\n\nThat crisis can be partly pinned on the pharmaceutical companies that helped to build factory farming, undermining their stated missions of improving human and animal health. After decades of increasing pressure from consumers, public health experts, and US policymakers, some of these pharma companies have in recent years pledged to move away from antibiotics, but little progress has been made. And through it all, animal pharma companies have remained set on further expanding factory farming in the US and around the globe.\n\nHow Big Pharma helped build factory farming\n\nIn the interwar period, the discovery of antibiotics like Prontosil and penicillin led to a pharmaceutical revolution, enabling doctors to quickly heal common bacterial infections in humans that until then had often been life-threatening. The drugs soon became mass-produced and affordable, and more antibiotic discoveries followed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long until pharmaceutical leaders like Pfizer looked for markets beyond human medicine. They found it on the farm, according to Claas Kirchhelle, a medical historian at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research who documents the rise of antibiotics in agriculture in his book Pyrrhic Progress: The History of Antibiotics in Anglo-American Food Production.\n\nBy the late 1940s, researchers came to understand that when farmed animals are fed regular, low doses of certain antibiotics, they gain weight faster on less feed and better stave off disease, Kirchhelle explains in his book.\n\nThis one-two punch of disease prevention and rapid weight gain suddenly made it more feasible to pack large numbers of animals in barns, while having fewer animals die from infectious diseases and shortening the amount of time it took for animals to reach their \u201cmarket weight.\u201d These became two hallmarks of factory farming, enabling farmers to squeeze more meat out of each animal and increase profits.\n\nAntibiotic adoption in the meat industry was swift: By 1951, around 16 percent of antibiotics sold in the US went to livestock; by 1970, it reached 43 percent.\n\nA veterinarian preparing a vaccine for a dairy cow. Sutthichai Supapornpasupad\n\nAmerica\u2019s precipitous increase in meat production after World War II, facilitated in part by antibiotics, was widely celebrated as a solution to Malthusian fears that humanity wouldn\u2019t be able to feed a rapidly growing global population. \u201cFor patriotic US researchers, politicians, and journalists, promulgating agricultural plenty and efficiency-boosting technologies like antibiotics became a moral duty,\u201d Kirchhelle writes.\n\nBy the 1960s, scientists paid increasing attention to the antimicrobial resistance threat posed by animal agriculture. Strains of bacterial diseases like salmonella and E. coli can adapt and build resistance to those antibiotics and then leave the farm and infect humans in a number of ways: improperly cooked meat, livestock manure leaching into drinking water or rivers and streams, or on the clothes of a farm owner or worker.\n\nBut the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees animal pharmaceuticals, for decades failed to take the issue seriously and downplayed warnings. In the 1970s, the agency did make an earnest attempt to limit the use of two classes of human-critical antibiotics in livestock, but it was thwarted by a burgeoning coalition of livestock and pharmaceutical business interests. According to Kirchhelle, this coalition also funded a separate organization to conduct \u201ccounter science\u201d to muddy the scientific debate over the proposed ban, which included organizing experts to write a report that was then edited without the researchers\u2019 consent.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the mid-2010s that the FDA took two basic but important actions to meaningfully address the problem: requiring farmers to get veterinarian prescriptions for medically important antibiotics, and asking \u2014 though not requiring \u2014 animal pharmaceutical companies to remove language on product labels about antibiotics\u2019 ability to make animals grow faster. Sales of antibiotics soon fell rapidly.\n\nIt represented progress, but not enough, according to Gail Hansen, an antimicrobial expert and former state public health veterinarian in Kansas. Hansen told me the agency\u2019s actions represented a compromise that was favorable to industry compared to what some high-ranking members of Congress were pushing for at the time: significant antibiotic use restrictions and increased transparency from drug makers on how their antibiotics were used in livestock.\n\nPharma companies wanted to change antibiotic use \u201con their own terms and not the government telling them what to do,\u201d according to Hansen. \u201cIf they could show just a little bit of good faith,\u201d by complying with the FDA, they could stave off stricter regulation.\n\nPharma and Big Ag still can\u2019t quit antibiotics\n\nOver the last decade, livestock pharma companies have found themselves at a crossroads. Under growing scrutiny from public health experts and policymakers, the biggest players in the sector have committed to \u201cantimicrobial stewardship,\u201d promising to wean farmers off medically important antibiotics by investing in vaccine development, nutritional supplements like enzymes and probiotics, and animal-only antibiotics, which aren\u2019t used in human medicine.\n\nBut while the FDA\u2019s actions cut antibiotic use on farms from 2015 to 2017, corporate efforts since then have seemingly failed to move the needle: Sales of medically important antibiotics increased 10 percent from 2017 to 2023, and the US remains far behind Europe, where in 2020, antibiotic use per animal was about half that of the US. The continent slashed antibiotic use through tougher regulations, better farm hygiene, and relying more on vaccines, enzymes, probiotics, and other products to prevent disease, according to Leon Marchal, a Netherlands-based innovation director at IFF Health & Bioscience, which develops and sells animal health products.\n\nDespite the animal pharmaceutical industry\u2019s stated commitments to antimicrobial stewardship, some of their actions have suggested a reluctance to move away from the drugs. In 2023, the share of Elanco\u2019s revenue from medically important antibiotics, for both pets and livestock, stood at 10 percent, down just 2 percent from 2018.\n\nIn 2018, the company ran an advertising campaign designed to assuage consumer concerns over antibiotics in meat production. And at a major pork industry conference the same year, Elanco handed out brochures encouraging farmers to feed pigs a pair of antibiotics to make the animals grow fatter. But a few years earlier, the FDA had told one of Elanco\u2019s subsidiaries that drug combination was unsafe and shouldn\u2019t be promoted to increase weight gain. Elanco committed to stop distributing the brochures after the New York Times inquired about it.\n\n\u201cFor more than 15 years, we\u2019ve been focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use, reducing the need for antibiotics and improving the health of animals through vaccines, nutrition and other efforts,\u201d Elanco wrote in a statement to Vox. \u201cMost importantly, Elanco has focused on expanding access to animal-only antibiotics, which don\u2019t create a threat to human resistance, and creating antibiotic alternatives, including vaccines, enzymes, probiotic and prebiotics.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Zoetis was using similar messaging when selling human-relevant antibiotics to farmers in India, where, like in other middle-income countries, poultry factory farming is quickly expanding. The company told the press that it was following India\u2019s antibiotics regulations.\n\nRelated How factory farming built America\n\nAs the reputational risk of selling medically important antibiotics in the US rises, some of the biggest animal pharmaceutical companies are moving on to what Elanco has called its \u201cnext economic opportunity\u201d: mitigating climate change. In 2018, the company gained FDA approval for a drug that reduces ammonia emissions in cattle; Zoetis has also announced research efforts to develop a similar product. Last year, the FDA completed its review of Elanco\u2019s Bovaer product \u2014 a powder that when fed to dairy cows daily can reduce emissions from their methane-rich burps \u2014 and deemed it safe and effective.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to bringing innovative solutions that allow farmers and ranchers to reduce and measure emissions,\u201d the company wrote in a statement to Vox.\n\nThese products have the potential to reduce some types of cattle-caused emissions, but by much less than we could by simply eating far fewer animal products and more of the plant-based foods that Elanco executives have attacked. But companies that depend on factory farming would prefer we keep engineering animals\u2019 diets for maximum productivity, and now, minimal environmental liability, rather than reach for a veggie burger or glass of soy milk.\n\nThis new class of emission-reducing feed products may come with a sustainable sheen, but they\u2019re in keeping with how the industry views animals \u2014 not as living, feeling creatures, but as machines whose diets and environments must be endlessly fine-tuned with chemical inputs to compensate for unhygienic farms, poor animal welfare, and a sizable carbon footprint. Even as policy leaders in wealthy countries begin to wake up to the costs of this system, it continues to grow bigger and more entrenched.\n\nThis \u201cmodel of food production,\u201d Kirchhelle said, \u201cis becoming more and more the dominant mode of producing animals worldwide.\u201d",

Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors.

Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants touted its lead product candidate azelaprag in connection with BioAge\u2019s ongoing STRIDES clinical trial with expectations of topline results in 2025. Defendants also mentioned its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s (\u201cLilly\u201d) Chorus clinical development organization who would be advising and assisting on all aspects of the STRIDES trial design and execution. Defendants further discussed the potential for a second Phase 2 clinical trial combining azelaprag and semaglutide to treat obesity in individuals ages 18 years and older. Therefore, the IPO represented to the public that there were no safety concerns and BioAge expected top line results and to meet its primary endpoint goals in connection with its STRIDES clinical trial.\n\nContrary to these representations, BioAge discontinued the ongoing STRIDES Phase 2 study of its investigational drug candidate azelaprag after several subjects showed elevated levels of liver enzymes warning of potential organ damage. As a result, defendants discontinued the clinical trial and halted further enrollment. Given the fact that defendants failure to disclose the potential for liver transaminitis in any of its previous clinical Phase 1 trials and various preclinical tox studies, defendants\u2019 statements in BioAge\u2019s registration statement were false and/or materially misleading at the time of the IPO.

            "content": "Editor\u2019s note: Variety has revived its \u201cTenpercenteries\u201d column that chronicles the inner-workings and client signings of Hollywood\u2019s top talent agencies and management firms. Tenpercenteries was a staple of Variety from the mid-1990s through the early 2010s. We\u2019re happy to bring it back with a heightened focus on deals and dish involving showbiz\u2019s top talent representation firms.\n\nThe young (and the frugal) staff members at United Talent Agency were up in arms last week, sources told Tenpercenteries, over news from leadership that the company was suspending its free lunch service.\n\nWhat began as a post-pandemic perk to lure staff back into the office had miraculously and generously lasted until 2025. UTA was serving up dishes from Leora, the restaurant that sits in the agency\u2019s shadow in Beverly Hills. A turkey club sandwich will run you $15 and a sesame ginger salad sets you back $22 (very modest prices for Los Angeles eateries, btw).\n\nAlisa Gao for Variety\n\nThe free chow was served daily, except on Fridays, and continued through a brutal period of industrywide cost-cutting that persists to this day. Free catered lunches were introduced to Hollywood\u2019s office culture by Silicon Valley, where companies like Facebook would install shopping mall-style food courts to keep programmers fed and happy. Netflix still boasts an impressive menu of cuisine (hot and takeaway) at its Sunset Boulevard headquarters.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIf UTA\u2019s biggest rivals \u2014 CAA and WME \u2014 ever did offer free lunch, they certainly don\u2019t now. Sources at UTA said agency heads are currently cooking up supplements like coupons, to roll out in the coming weeks. Some UTA assistants wondered aloud to their bosses if they would be compensated for the lunch loss, estimating the meals would introduce a financial burden they haven\u2019t had to carry in years.\n\nWe would happily pay for lunch to hear how those conversations went.\n\nNotable talent agency and management signings:\n\nKamala Harris has signed with CAA for representation in all areas, with a focus on speaking engagements and publishing. She was repped by the agency before becoming Vice President in 2021.\n\nConstance Wu Mark Seigler\n\nGersh has signed Constance Wu. She\u2019s best known for her roles in 2018\u2019s \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d 2019\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d and the 2015-2020 ABC comedy series \u201cFresh Off the Boat.\u201d\n\nUTA has signed seven-time Grammy- and Academy Award-winning artist Jon Batiste for representation in all areas.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden has signed with CAA. Biden was represented by the agency from 2017 to 2020, following his two terms as Vice President under President Barack Obama.\n\nUTA has signed digital media company Jubilee Media and its founder Jason Y. Lee for representation in all areas. In addition to the popular format \u201cSurrounded,\u201d Jubilee\u2019s YouTube channels feature such series as \u201cMiddle Ground,\u201d \u201cOdd One Out,\u201d \u201cVersus 1,\u201d \u201c30 vs 1,\u201d and \u201cRanking.\u201d\n\nQuvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis Getty Images\n\nQuvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis has signed with Gersh for representation in all areas. She is the youngest person to be nominated for best actress at the Oscars, for her turn in 2012\u2019s \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild.\u201d\n\nAlmost Friday Media, the digital content network and comedy production hub born out of the Instagram meme account Friday Beers, has signed with Range Media Partners. Almost Friday Media is working on a TV pilot with Danny McBride\u2019s Rough House Pictures.\n\nWriter, director and executive producer Matt Hastings has signed with Gersh. Hastings continues to also be repped by attorney Bob Getman and The Gotham Group. Hastings\u2019 latest drama series, \u201cFallen,\u201d premiered last month on Sundance Now and AMC+.\n\nMatt Donnelly is senior entertainment and media writer for Variety.\n\nKatcy Stephan is a film reporter for Variety.\n\nTenpercenteries also runs in Variety\u2018s weekly magazine",

After traveling from Ukraine to the United States to discuss a negotiation to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the Ukrainian President\u2019s time at the White House was cut short.\n\n\"Mr. President, do you think your relationship with Donald Trump \u2014 President Trump \u2014 after today can be salvaged?\" FOX News chief political anchor Bret Baier asked Zelenskyy.\n\n\"Yes, of course, because it's relations more than two presidents.

Your people helped save our people we wanted very much to have all these strong relations, and where it counted, we will have it.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, Zelenskyy took to social media to thank the United States and Trump emphasizing how crucial Trump\u2019s support is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for us to have President Trump\u2019s support. He wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do. We are the ones living this war in Ukraine. It\u2019s a fight for our freedom, for our very survival,\u201d he wrote in a social media thread on X.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to sign the minerals agreement, and it will be the first step toward security guarantees. But it\u2019s not enough, and we need more than just that. A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. We\u2019ve been fighting for 3 years, and Ukrainian people,\u201d he added.\n\nZelenskyy was about what set him off during the exchange between the leaders to which he responded the incident was \u201cnot good for both sides anyway.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted to social media, Trump said Zelenskyy can come back when he is \u201cready for Peace.\u201d\n\nThe Oval Office exchange led to a canceled joint press conference between the world leaders, an unsigned minerals deal and Trump asking the Ukrainian president to leave earlier than planned.",

(NASDAQ:COLL) stands against the other small cap pharma stocks.\n\nImpact of US Tariffs and Obesity Drug Performance on the Pharmaceutical Industry\n\nEmily Field, Head of European Pharma Research at Barclays, spoke on CNBC on February 20 about the performance of obesity medications, the effects of US tariffs, and the dynamics of the pharmaceutical industry. According to her, the industry might not perform poorly at least in the first half of this year. The effectiveness of obesity medications is still up for debate, though, as leading companies in the field have shown inconsistent results.\n\nSpeaking about the tariffs, she stated that since some businesses assemble their products in the US after producing them overseas, their implementation raises several unanswered questions for the pharmaceutical industry. These businesses therefore have relatively low manufacturing costs, which is an important factor to take into account when assessing the effects of tariffs. She thought that these businesses could easily absorb the higher expense of the tariffs. The topic hasn't come up much on earnings calls this quarter, and the market is nearing the end of the reporting season.\n\nEli Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer spoke with CNBC's Health and Pharma correspondent Angelica Peebles about the weight reduction industry. The domain presents opportunities for easier-to-use treatments, including tablets, and medications that help individuals lose weight, she noted based on the conversation. How much weight reduction users need to observe on top of what they already have is another topic of discussion about the subject. According to Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer of Eli Lilly, the majority of the audience seems to benefit from medications that provide about 20% weight loss. According to him, the market for stronger medications that offer at least 25% is smaller.\n\nHe also believed that the potential benefits of these weight reduction medications for a wide range of illnesses were the most fascinating thing he had witnessed in his work as a scientist and doctor. The patterns they have been observing in the answers from patients serve as their current source of knowledge.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we selected stocks with a market capitalization between $250 million and $2 billion and ranked them based on the highest hedge fund sentiment according to Insider Monkey's database, as of Q4 2024.",

The CHMP opinion is an important step toward bringing Jaypirca to patients in the European Union .\"\n\nFollowing this positive opinion, the application for the use of Jaypirca in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL who have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor is now referred to the European Commission for final action. The European Commission's decision is expected in the next one to two months. Jaypirca has also previously received a conditional marketing authorization by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.\n\nThe positive opinion is supported by data from the BRUIN CLL-321 clinical trial, the first randomized Phase 3 study in CLL ever conducted exclusively in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. The study's primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was met at the prespecified time of final analysis ( Aug. 29, 2023 ), based on independent review committee (IRC) assessment, demonstrating pirtobrutinib was superior to investigator's choice of idelalisib plus rituximab (IdelaR) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR), both global standards of care.1 At an updated analysis ( Aug. 29, 2024 ), pirtobrutinib reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 46% compared to IdelaR or BR (median PFS: 14.0 vs. 8.7 months), consistent with the primary analysis. PFS results were consistent across key subgroups, including patients who received prior venetoclax and across subgroups associated with poor prognosis, including those with TP53 mutations and/or 17p deletions, unmutated IGHV status and complex karyotype. Additionally, the median time to next treatment or death (TTNT), a prespecified, descriptive secondary endpoint in the trial that can serve as a surrogate marker for disease control outcomes, was 24 months compared to the control arm of 11 months (63% improvement; HR=0.37 [95% CI, 0.25-0.52]). The overall safety profile for patients treated with pirtobrutinib in BRUIN CLL-321 was consistent with safety data from the Phase 1/2 BRUIN study, including adverse events of special interest. The most common adverse reactions of any grade were neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea, anemia, rash, and contusion.\n\nResults from the BRUIN CLL-321 study were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024 .\n\n\"We are pleased to receive a positive opinion from the CHMP, signaling that the European Union may lead the way in broadening patient access to Jaypirca for those with relapsed or refractory CLL in the post-BTK inhibitor setting,\" said Jacob Van Naarden , executive vice president and president of Lilly Oncology. \"There are currently no treatment options that have been specifically studied in a randomized Phase 3 trial in this patient population, and we are hopeful Jaypirca will be a meaningful new option for patients. We look forward to the European Commission's decision in the coming months.\"\n\nIn addition to this positive opinion in CLL and conditional approval in MCL in the EU, Jaypirca was approved in the U.S. in 2023 under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Accelerated Approval pathway for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor, and adult patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy including a BTK inhibitor and BCL-2 inhibitor. Lilly has submitted supplemental marketing applications for Jaypirca in the post-BTK inhibitor setting for CLL/SLL patients around the globe, including in the U.S.\n\nAbout BRUIN CLL-321\n\nBRUIN CLL-321 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study of pirtobrutinib versus investigator's choice of idelalisib plus rituximab (IdelaR) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in BTK inhibitor pre-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The trial enrolled 238 patients, who were randomized 1:1 to receive pirtobrutinib (200 mg orally, once daily) or investigator's choice of either IdelaR or BR per labeled doses. This trial's primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) per 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria, as assessed by blinded independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints include PFS, as assessed by investigator; overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR); event-free survival; overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TTNT); safety and tolerability; and patient-reported outcomes (PRO).\n\nAbout Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib)\n\nJaypirca (pirtobrutinib, formerly known as LOXO-305) (pronounced jay-pihr-kaa) is a highly selective (300 times more selective for BTK versus 98% of other kinases tested in preclinical studies), non-covalent (reversible) inhibitor of the enzyme BTK.2 BTK is a validated molecular target found across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).3,4 Jaypirca is a U.S. FDA-approved oral prescription medicine, 100 mg or 50 mg tablets taken as a once-daily 200 mg dose with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAbout Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)\n\nCLL is a form of slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma that develops from white blood cells known as lymphocytes.5,6 CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults.5 There are roughly 100,000 new cases of CLL globally each year, and the overall incidence of CLL in Europe is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year.7,8 In CLL, the cancer cells are present in the blood.5\n\nINDICATIONS FOR JAYPIRCA (pirtobrutinib) (in the United States )\n\nJaypirca is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of\n\nAdult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor.\n\nAdult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.\n\nThese indications are approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR JAYPIRCA (pirtobrutinib)\n\nInfections: Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, fungal) and opportunistic infections occurred in Jaypirca-treated patients. In a clinical trial, Grade \u22653 infections occurred in 24% of patients with hematologic malignancies, most commonly pneumonia (14%); fatal infections occurred (4.4%). Sepsis (6%) and febrile neutropenia (4%) occurred. In patients with CLL/SLL, Grade \u22653 infections occurred (32%), with fatal infections occurring in 8%. Opportunistic infections included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and fungal infection. Consider prophylaxis, including vaccinations and antimicrobial prophylaxis, in patients at increased risk for infection, including opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms, evaluate promptly, and treat appropriately. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.\n\nHemorrhage: Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred with Jaypirca. Major hemorrhage (Grade \u22653 bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3% of patients, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred (0.3%). Bleeding of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred (17%). Major hemorrhage occurred in patients taking Jaypirca with (0.7%) and without (2.3%) antithrombotic agents. Consider risks/benefits of co-administering antithrombotic agents with Jaypirca. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue Jaypirca. Consider benefit/risk of withholding Jaypirca 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending on type of surgery and bleeding risk.\n\nCytopenias: Jaypirca can cause cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. In a clinical trial, Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including decreased neutrophils (26%), decreased platelets (12%), and decreased hemoglobin (12%), developed in Jaypirca-treated patients. Grade 4 decreased neutrophils (14%) and Grade 4 decreased platelets (6%) developed. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.\n\nCardiac Arrhythmias: Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in patients who received Jaypirca. In a clinical trial of patients with hematologic malignancies, atrial fibrillation or flutter were reported in 3.2% of Jaypirca-treated patients, with Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or flutter in 1.5%. Other serious cardiac arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest occurred (0.5%). Patients with cardiac risk factors such as hypertension or previous arrhythmias may be at increased risk. Monitor for signs and symptoms of arrhythmias (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea) and manage appropriately. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.\n\nSecond Primary Malignancies: Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinomas, developed in 9% of Jaypirca-treated patients. The most frequent malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (4.6%). Other second primary malignancies included solid tumors (including genitourinary and breast cancers) and melanoma. Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor for development of second primary malignancies.\n\nHepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI): Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of DILI, has occurred in patients treated with BTK inhibitors, including Jaypirca. Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout Jaypirca treatment. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after Jaypirca, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold Jaypirca. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue Jaypirca.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity: Jaypirca can cause fetal harm in pregnant women. Administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 3-times the recommended 200 mg/day dose. Advise pregnant women of potential fetal risk and females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after last dose.\n\nAdverse Reactions (ARs) in Patients Who Received Jaypirca\n\nThe most common (\u226520%) ARs in the BRUIN pooled safety population of patients with hematologic malignancies (n=593) were decreased neutrophil count (46%), decreased hemoglobin (39%), fatigue (32%), decreased lymphocyte count (31%), musculoskeletal pain (30%), decreased platelet count (29%), diarrhea (24%), COVID-19 (22%), bruising (21%), cough (20%).\n\nMantle Cell Lymphoma\n\nSerious ARs occurred in 38% of patients. Serious ARs occurring in \u22652% of patients were pneumonia (14%), COVID-19 (4.7%), musculoskeletal pain (3.9%), hemorrhage (2.3%), pleural effusion (2.3%), and sepsis (2.3%). Fatal ARs within 28 days of last Jaypirca dose occurred in 7% of patients, most commonly due to infections (4.7%), including COVID-19 (3.1% of all patients).\n\nDose Modifications and Discontinuations: ARs led to dose reductions in 4.7%, treatment interruption in 32%, and permanent discontinuation of Jaypirca in 9% of patients. ARs resulting in dosage modification in >5% of patients included pneumonia and neutropenia. ARs resulting in permanent discontinuation in >1% of patients included pneumonia.\n\nMost common ARs (\u226515%), excluding laboratory terms (all Grades %; Grade 3-4 %): fatigue (29; 1.6), musculoskeletal pain (27; 3.9), diarrhea (19; -), edema (18; 0.8), dyspnea (17; 2.3), pneumonia (16; 14), bruising (16; -).\n\nSelect Laboratory Abnormalities (all Grades %; Grade 3 or 4 %) that Worsened from Baseline in \u226510% of Patients: hemoglobin decreased (42; 9), platelet count decreased (39; 14), neutrophil count decreased (36; 16), lymphocyte count decreased (32; 15), creatinine increased (30; 1.6), calcium decreased (19; 1.6), AST increased (17; 1.6), potassium decreased (13; 1.6), sodium decreased (13; -), lipase increased (12; 4.4), alkaline phosphatase increased (11; -), ALT increased (11; 1.6), potassium increased (11; 0.8). Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities in >5% of patients included neutrophils decreased (10), platelets decreased (7), lymphocytes decreased (6).\n\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma\n\nSerious ARs occurred in 56% of patients. Serious ARs occurring in \u22655% of patients were pneumonia (18%), COVID-19 (9%), sepsis (7%), and febrile neutropenia (7%). Fatal ARs within 28 days of last Jaypirca dose occurred in 11% of patients, most commonly due to infections (10%), including sepsis (5%) and COVID-19 (2.7%).\n\nDose Modifications and Discontinuations: ARs led to dose reductions in 3.6%, treatment interruption in 42%, and permanent discontinuation of Jaypirca in 9% of patients. ARs resulting in dose reductions in >1% included neutropenia; treatment interruptions in >5% of patients included pneumonia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and COVID-19; permanent discontinuation in >1% of patients included second primary malignancy, COVID-19, and sepsis.\n\nMost common ARs (\u226520%), excluding laboratory terms (all Grades %; Grade 3-4 %): fatigue (36; 2.7), bruising (36; -), cough (33; -), musculoskeletal pain (32; 0.9), COVID-19 (28; 7), pneumonia (27; 16), diarrhea (26; -), abdominal pain (25; 2.7), dyspnea (22; 2.7), hemorrhage (22; 2.7), edema (21; -), nausea (21; -), pyrexia (20; 2.7), headache (20; 0.9).\n\nSelect Laboratory Abnormalities (all Grades %; Grade 3 or 4 %) that Worsened from Baseline in \u226520% of Patients: neutrophil count decreased (63; 45), hemoglobin decreased (48; 19), calcium decreased (40; 2.8), platelet count decreased (30; 15), sodium decreased (30; -), lymphocyte count decreased (23; 8), ALT increased (23; 2.8), AST increased (23; 1.9), creatinine increased (23; -), lipase increased (21; 7), alkaline phosphatase increased (21; -). Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities in >5% of patients included neutrophils decreased (23).\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nStrong CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use with Jaypirca increased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure, which may increase risk of Jaypirca ARs. Avoid use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Jaypirca. If concomitant use is unavoidable, reduce Jaypirca dosage according to approved labeling.\n\nStrong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Concomitant use with Jaypirca decreased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure, which may reduce Jaypirca efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of Jaypirca with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inducers is unavoidable, increase Jaypirca dosage according to approved labeling.\n\nSensitive CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP Substrates: Concomitant use with Jaypirca increased their plasma concentrations, which may increase risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates for drugs that are sensitive to minimal concentration changes. Follow recommendations for these sensitive substrates in their approved labeling.\n\nUse in Special Populations\n\nPregnancy and Lactation: Due to potential for Jaypirca to cause fetal harm, verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to starting Jaypirca and advise use of effective contraception during treatment and for one week after last dose. Presence of pirtobrutinib in human milk is unknown. Advise women not to breastfeed while taking Jaypirca and for one week after last dose.\n\nGeriatric Use: In the pooled safety population of patients with hematologic malignancies, patients aged \u226565 years experienced higher rates of Grade \u22653 ARs and serious ARs compared to patients <65 years of age.\n\nRenal Impairment: Severe renal impairment increases pirtobrutinib exposure. Reduce Jaypirca dosage in patients with severe renal impairment according to approved labeling.\n\nPT HCP ISI MCL_CLL AA JUN2024\n\nPlease see Prescribing Information and Patient Information for Jaypirca.\n\nAbout Lilly\n\nLilly is a medicine company turning science into healing to make life better for people around the world.

            "content": "Eli Lilly announced Tuesday that it is selling higher-dose vials of Zepbound at lower prices in its direct-to-consumer program.\n\nThe program offers self-administered vials for people whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover the cost of the drug, such as those on Medicare. The vials are only available to people who pay out of pocket on the company\u2019s direct-to-consumer website, Lilly Direct.\n\nThe move could attract people who had been taking a compounded version of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound. Many people opt for non-branded versions of the drug, which are often sold at a fraction of the price of the FDA-approved branded version from Lilly.\n\nAs with compounded tirzepatide, people who use Lilly\u2019s self-pay vials need to administer the drug themselves using a needle and syringe. Participants receive four single-dose vials per month.\n\nThe company is now offering 7.5-milligram and 10-milligram vials for $499 per month when patients fill their first prescription or refill any time within 45 days of their last delivery. Otherwise, the prices increase to $599 and $699, respectively.\n\nLilly started selling self-administered 2.5-milligram and 5-milligram vials last August. The company is now reducing the cost of those doses by $50 each, bringing them to $349 and $499, respectively.\n\nExpanding Single-Dose Vials for Zepbound Users\n\nA Lilly spokesperson told Verywell that about 10% of people who start taking Zepbound for the first time enroll in the self-pay program. This includes people who previously used compounded tirzepatide.\n\nFor more than a year after Zepbound hit the market in 2022, persistent shortages made it difficult for patients to find the drugs at pharmacies. Telehealth companies like Hims & Hers and Ro partnered with compounding pharmacies to sell off-brand tirzepatide to their members.\n\nLegally, when a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in shortage, compounding pharmacies can produce alternative versions of the drug. Providers usually prescribe a compounded medication when a patient needs a different dose or formula than the approved drug. In the case of GLP-1 drugs, compounded versions are often much cheaper than branded ones.\n\nIn December, the FDA said the tirzepatide shortage had been resolved and removed it from the shortage list. In response, the Outsourcing Facilities Association, a compounding pharmacy trade group, filed a lawsuit against the FDA. The organizations claim that tirzepatide was still not widely available and removing it from the shortage list is \u201creckless and arbitrary,\u201d in part because the FDA did not originally allow for a transition period.\n\nThis week, the FDA also removed Ozempic and Wegovy from the drug shortage list. The agency gave compounding pharmacies a 30- to 60-day off-ramp period to help patients transition to the brand-name version.\n\n\u201cI do question whether in resolving the shortage FDA has taken into account demand for the compounded drug\u2014the number of patients who\u2019ll need to be transitioned from compounded version to FDA-approved version,\" Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, said in a statement. \"There\u2019s likely to be some sticker shock for many, and whether they\u2019ll be able to continue to afford the therapy remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nDifferences Between Zepbound Vials and Pens\n\nZepbound typically comes in an auto-injector pen prefilled with a set dose that patients can administer under their skin with the press of a button.\n\nPatients using Lilly\u2019s self-pay program receive single-dose vials instead. They must use a syringe and needle to draw up the medication and inject themselves. Lilly provides instructions on how to properly fill the syringe, tap out air bubbles, and inject the medication to ensure you get the full dose.\n\nBrintha Vasagar, MD, MPH, a family medicine doctor in Wisconsin, recommends that people who are trying self-injection for the first time speak with their healthcare team for tips on where and how to inject the medication.\n\n\u201cThe needles for these types of injections are small, but you can also make the process more comfortable by using an ice pack for a few minutes prior to numb the skin,\u201d Vasagar told Verywell in an email. \u201cSelf-injecting from a single-use needle versus an autoinjector usually takes a little more preparation to make sure you are taking the right dose, but both feel similar when you are getting the injection.\u201d\n\nCompounded tirzepatide products may contain different ingredients depending on the pharmacy that made it. Vasagar said that patients may experience different side effects when transitioning from a compounded version to the brand-name version.\n\n\u201cBoth the branded and the compounded medications require physician oversight and a prescription,\u201d she said. \u201cYour family medicine physician can help you manage any side effects, make sure you are on the right dose for your body, and ensure you are successful in making lifestyle changes to maintain a healthy weight.\u201d",

            "content": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company\u2019s Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024. - Image: Bloomberg / Contributor (Getty Images)\n\nEli Lilly (LLY), the maker of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound, launched a new advertising campaign on Friday warning patients about off-brand versions of its treatments, saying \u201cthey put people at risk.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, titled \u201cHealthy Skepticism,\u201d will appear in print ads in select national newspapers and a video version is already live on the pharma giant\u2019s website.\n\nThe video ad takes aim at knockoff versions of Eli Lilly\u2019s patented treatments \u2014 even when they\u2019re recommended by friends, family, or \u201cyour favorite podcast.\u201d The ad ends with text stating that real, tested, and federally approved medicine doesn\u2019t require \u201cfaith.\u201d It urges the viewer to be \u201ca healthy skeptic.\u201d\n\nThe campaign comes as Eli Lilly steps up its crackdown on unauthorized versions of its weight-loss drugs and as Zepbound emerges from a prolonged stint on the FDA\u2019s drug-shortage list.\n\nZepbound belongs to a popular class of medications known as GLP-1 drugs, which also includes Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs have been in short supply since 2022. That designation allowed pharmacies, telehealth companies, and other providers to sell compounded versions of the patented drugs, which are customized formulations of approved medications.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are identical to commercially available medications. However, when a drug is officially in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer considers it \u201ccommercially available,\u201d creating a temporary loophole for compounders.\n\nNow, that loophole is closing. The FDA recently declared the shortages of Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy over \u2014 meaning companies that have been selling off-brand versions will soon have to stop.\n\nIn December, the agency also warned that it has \u201cidentified some areas of concern for compounded GLP-1 drugs.\u201d It alerted consumers that compounded medications \u201cdo not undergo FDA\u2019s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.\u201d\n\nBut the fight isn\u2019t over, yet. A group representing compounding pharmacies has filed two lawsuits against the FDA over its decision to remove the medications from its shortage list. The Outsourcing Facility Association (OFA) argues that the agency is ignoring evidence that shortages persist and claims its decision will prevent patients from accessing medicine they need. Some doctors have come out in support of compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs.\n\nEli Lilly has asked to join one of the lawsuits to protect its interests. The pharma giant\u2019s stock price has risen more than 50% since the FDA approved Zepbound on Nov. 8, 2023 \u2014 to around $905 per share, driving its market cap north of $800 billion.",

Trump made the warning during a closed-door event on Saturday, in front of some of the biggest names in the industry, including Merck CEO Robert Davis and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. Lilly\u2019s head David Ricks was also in attendance.\n\nA few days earlier, Trump said he was considering a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical products\u2014alongside other imports such as semiconductors and automobiles\u2014as reported by CNBC. These duties, Trump said, could \u201cgo very substantially higher over a course of a year.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump likewise revealed steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Though these levies weren\u2019t aimed specifically at the pharma industry, some analysts raised concerns that they could still pose some problems for the industry. The tariffs on China are particularly worrisome, Seeking Alpha analyst Edmund Ingham wrote at the time, because biopharma is \u201cincreasingly looking to China to find promising new drug candidates.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the press on Wednesday, Lilly CEO Ricks said it plans to spread its $27 billion commitment across four new manufacturing facilities, which it plans to build over the next five years, according to reporting from Reuters. The exact locations of these plants have yet to be revealed, but the pharma believes they will create over 3,000 new jobs for engineers, scientists and other skilled workers, as well as 10,000 construction openings.\n\nLilly is no stranger to hefty domestic investments. In October 2024, the pharma pumped $4.5 billion into its operations in Indiana, earmarked for the construction of a hybrid facility that will house both research and manufacturing activities. Lilly has previously made several multi-billion investments in its home state, including a $2.1 billion commitment in May 2022 and a $5.3 billion infusion in May 2024, both to boost production capacity.\n\nThese manufacturing investments have paid off for Lilly, with the FDA in December 2024 formally ending the shortage of its blockbuster GLP-1 therapy tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly will invest tens of billions more dollars in U.S. drug manufacturing in a significant enlargement of plans the Indianapolis company had already described as historic.\n\nLilly, which makes the popular obesity medicine Zepbound, previously pledged to spend $23 billion on constructing and refurbishing factories in the U.S. to churn out the company\u2019s new pills and injections. On Tuesday, the company more than doubled that target. Including commitments made since 2020, it expects to pour over $50 billion into U.S. capital expenditures.\n\nAccording to Lilly, the planned spending is the largest pharmaceutical investment in domestic manufacturing of the past decade.\n\nThe $27 billion in new investment will go toward building four drug production facilities, three of which will be dedicated to making the active pharmaceutical ingredients the industry regularly imports from abroad. Specifically, Lilly said its investment will help to reshore \u201ccritical capabilities of small molecule chemical synthesis.\u201d The fourth site will support the company\u2019s global manufacturing network for injectable therapies.\n\nOverall, Lilly expects the four facilities will eventually employ more than 3,000 technicians, scientists and other personnel, as well as create nearly 10,000 construction jobs.\n\nLilly announced its plans at a press conference in Washington, D.C., six days after company head David Ricks, along with his CEO peers at Pfizer and Merck & Co., met with President Donald Trump at the White House. According to Bloomberg, Trump warned the executives their industry could face tariffs if they don\u2019t move manufacturing back to the U.S. Earlier last week, Trump had said he would impose tariffs \u201cin the neighborhood of 25%\u201d on pharmaceuticals, among other goods.\n\nIn a statement, Ricks said the company\u2019s decision to further invest in domestic manufacturing capacity reflected its conviction in its drug pipeline. But his statement included an economic message, too: \u201cOur confidence positions us to help reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, which will benefit hard-working American families and increase exports of medicines made in the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nRicks also called for an extension of tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term, calling them \u201cfoundational\u201d to Lilly\u2019s domestic investment. In addition to lowering corporate levies, that law also reduced the rate at which profits earned overseas would be taxed upon repatriation to the U.S., aiding drugmakers in particular.\n\nLilly, and the pharmaceutical industry more broadly, hope to secure similar benefits from this administration, as well as to revise a Biden-era law that for the first time allowed Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices. Earning Trump\u2019s support may be harder, however. Per Bloomberg, Trump didn\u2019t commit to making changes in his meeting with Ricks last week, and expressed dissatisfaction at the higher costs of drugs in the U.S. versus overseas.\n\nThe commercial success of Zepbound has played a major role motivating Lilly\u2019s manufacturing spending. The company initially struggled to keep up with demand, only recently resolving shortages that had opened the door for compounding pharmacies to make off-brand copies. Previously announced investments in Indiana and in Wisconsin were aimed at expanding production of Zepbound and drugs like it.\n\nLilly hasn\u2019t yet finalized the locations for the four new factories. The company is currently in negotiations with several states and expects to announce the future site locations this year. It anticipates the new facilities will begin making drugs for patients within five years.\n\nPrior to 2022, Lilly averaged about $1.4 billion in annual capital expenditures. Spending increased to $3.45 billion in 2023 and $5.06 billion last year. Analysts expect Lilly sales, which reached $45 billion in 2025, to grow substantially on the back of Zepbound and successor obesity drugs the company is developing.",

The goal of this shift in representation is to reduce public stigma of a variety of conditions.\n\nDespite millions of Americans dealing with diseases, the study found a lack of presence of these health conditions in content. When they do show up, there are mis-portrayals which often do not reflect the true patient experience.\n\nOnly 2.8% of speaking characters across 2023\u2019s most popular TV shows and films had obesity, despite 37% of the U.S. population living with obesity, the study found. Of the characters with obesity, nearly half (46.2%) were depicted as \u201cbeing unlikable,\u201d and they were rarely shown in multidimensional roles. Only 4.6% held high-status jobs (neurosurgeon, Chief of Police, etc.), while 18.4% were portrayed as unemployed.

The company\u2019s fourth-quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial.\n\n\n\nStrengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Amazon\u2019s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\n\n\nHowever, Amazon announced disappointing guidance for the first quarter. Management cited foreign exchange headwinds and the absence of an extra Leap Year Day as factors likely to impact growth in the current quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\n\n\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+12.1% vs. +1.3%). The company\u2019s Q4 earnings beat estimates while sales missed the same. Demand for popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers.\n\n\n\nIn the past two years, Lilly received approvals for some new drugs like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024. It is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\n\nHowever, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of S&P Global have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +18%). The company remains well-poised to gain from the growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop products.\n\n\n\nThe latest service launches have been aiding the company's growth and enhancing its market reach. The stock is appealing for the dividend-seeking investors. Share buybacks boost investors' confidence and positively impact earnings per share.\n\n\n\nOn the flip side, growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses. A highly competitive environment strains the company's market share. Declining liquidity position due to reduction in cash troubles the company. The stock has gained 23.3% in a year and we have a Neutral recommendation on it in anticipation of a correction.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on S&P Global here >>>)\n\n\n\nCVD Equipment\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the past year (-37.3% vs. +3.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $21.2 million faces challenges from silicon carbide (SiC) market overcapacity, fluctuating revenues and declining liquidity, as cash fell to $10 million in third-quarter 2024. The volatile semiconductor sector pressures margins, with a $1 million inventory write-down on PVT150 systems.\n\n\n\nDespite setbacks, it reported a 31.4% year-over-year third-quarter revenue growth to $8.2 million, driven by demand in aerospace, defense and high-power electronics. Innovations like the PVT200 for 200mm SiC wafers and PowderCoat systems for EV materials position CVD Equipment for growth in high-demand markets.\n\n\n\nIts shift to a make-to-order model enhances scalability, aligning with industry tailwinds in semiconductors, EVs and energy storage. Despite competition and geopolitical risks, R&D investments target growth in EV, aerospace and high-power electronics.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on CVD Equipment here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Stryker Corp.

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY-2.59% ), the maker of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound, announced Wednesday that it plans to invest $27 billion in four new manufacturing sites in the United States.

President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal critic of the pharmaceutical industry, was just confirmed as health secretary. The timing suggests Eli Lilly is looking to align itself with the new administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement also comes as Lilly recovers from a recent supply shortage of Zepbound, one of its top-selling drugs, which accounted for about 10% of its sales in 2024. With demand for weight-loss treatments soaring, the company, which is already working on next-gen versions, appears to be taking steps to prevent future shortages that could create opportunities for other companies to sell cheaper, off-brand alternatives of its patented meds.\n\nStill, Lilly isn\u2019t hiding the fact that its investment may depend on tax policy.\n\n\u201cThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation passed in 2017 during President Trump\u2019s first term in office has been foundational to Lilly\u2019s domestic manufacturing investments, and it is essential that these policies are extended this year,\u201d Ricks said in the company\u2019s press release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe went even further in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, saying, \u201cWe need to see those [tax cuts] either extended or improved to support this.\u201d",

            "content": "Eli Lilly will invest tens of billions more dollars in U.S. drug manufacturing in a significant enlargement of plans the Indianapolis company had already described as historic.\n\nLilly, which makes the popular obesity medicine Zepbound, previously pledged to spend $23 billion on constructing and refurbishing factories in the U.S. to churn out the company\u2019s new pills and injections. On Tuesday, the company more than doubled that target. Including commitments made since 2020, it expects to pour over $50 billion into U.S. capital expenditures.\n\nAccording to Lilly, the planned spending is the largest pharmaceutical investment in domestic manufacturing of the past decade.\n\nThe $27 billion in new investment will go toward building four drug production facilities, three of which will be dedicated to making the active pharmaceutical ingredients the industry regularly imports from abroad. Specifically, Lilly said its investment will help to reshore \u201ccritical capabilities of small molecule chemical synthesis.\u201d The fourth site will support the company\u2019s global manufacturing network for injectable therapies.\n\nOverall, Lilly expects the four facilities will eventually employ more than 3,000 technicians, scientists and other personnel, as well as create nearly 10,000 construction jobs.\n\nLilly announced its plans at a press conference in Washington, D.C., six days after company head David Ricks, along with his CEO peers at Pfizer and Merck & Co., met with President Donald Trump at the White House. According to Bloomberg, Trump warned the executives their industry could face tariffs if they don\u2019t move manufacturing back to the U.S. Earlier last week, Trump had said he would impose tariffs \u201cin the neighborhood of 25%\u201d on pharmaceuticals, among other goods.\n\nIn a statement, Ricks said the company\u2019s decision to further invest in domestic manufacturing capacity reflected its conviction in its drug pipeline. But his statement included an economic message, too: \u201cOur confidence positions us to help reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, which will benefit hard-working American families and increase exports of medicines made in the U.S.A.\u201d\n\nRicks also called for an extension of tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump\u2019s first term, calling them \u201cfoundational\u201d to Lilly\u2019s domestic investment. In addition to lowering corporate levies, that law also reduced the rate at which profits earned overseas would be taxed upon repatriation to the U.S., aiding drugmakers in particular.\n\nLilly, and the pharmaceutical industry more broadly, hope to secure similar benefits from this administration, as well as to revise a Biden-era law that for the first time allowed Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices. Earning Trump\u2019s support may be harder, however. Per Bloomberg, Trump didn\u2019t commit to making changes in his meeting with Ricks last week, and expressed dissatisfaction at the higher costs of drugs in the U.S. versus overseas.\n\nThe commercial success of Zepbound has played a major role motivating Lilly\u2019s manufacturing spending. The company initially struggled to keep up with demand, only recently resolving shortages that had opened the door for compounding pharmacies to make off-brand copies. Previously announced investments in Indiana and in Wisconsin were aimed at expanding production of Zepbound and drugs like it.\n\nLilly hasn\u2019t yet finalized the locations for the four new factories. The company is currently in negotiations with several states and expects to announce the future site locations this year. It anticipates the new facilities will begin making drugs for patients within five years.\n\nPrior to 2022, Lilly averaged about $1.4 billion in annual capital expenditures. Spending increased to $3.45 billion in 2023 and $5.06 billion last year. Analysts expect Lilly sales, which reached $45 billion in 2025, to grow substantially on the back of Zepbound and successor obesity drugs the company is developing.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.\n\nIt comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies \u2014 and pharmaceutical businesses in particular \u2014 with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.\n\nEli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. \u2014 emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump's policies.\n\nLutnick said the investment is \"exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.\" He thanked Eli Lilly for \"doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.\"\n\nLutnick added that \"if you want to understand the tariff policy\" of the U.S., \"I have just articulated it.\"\n\nThe move brings Eli Lilly's total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company's investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.\n\n\"This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. \"We're making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.\"\n\nShares of the company closed more than 1% higher on Wednesday.\n\nThree of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a \"real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.\"\n\nThe fourth site will extend the company's global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.\n\nEli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.\n\nEli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company's other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.\n\nThe new investments aren't solely dedicated to Eli Lilly's current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions.\n\nRicks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.\n\nStill, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.\n\nDuring the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying \"America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.\"\n\nEli Lilly's efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments.\n\nThe FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats.\n\nHassett said the issue also \"disturbs the White House\" because offshore producers of copycat drugs are \"threatening lives in the U.S.\"",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nEli Lilly, the maker of blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro, said it will invest an additional $27 billion to build four new manufacturing plants in the United States, shoring up domestic manufacturing as President Donald Trump threatens new tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\n\nThree of the sites will make active pharmaceutical ingredients, the foundational materials of medicines, while the fourth will make injectable products, the Indianapolis-based drug giant said Wednesday.\n\nTrump said this month that he planned to impose tariffs of about 25% on goods including pharmaceuticals starting as early as April 2, and he warned drug industry executives in a private meeting last week that they should move production to the US, according to Bloomberg News. This week, Apple said it would invest $500 billion to expand US facilities after Trump announced 10% tariffs on imports from China.\n\nDavid Ricks, Eli Lilly\u2019s chief executive officer, told CNN that the company \u2013 whose revenue grew 32% to $45 billion last year on the back of its diabetes and weight loss drugs \u2013 wanted to create more manufacturing capacity and add redundancy to strengthen its supply chain. But he also noted that the \u201cpolicy environment \u2026 is a major contributor\u201d to the plans.\n\n\u201cIf the wishes of this administration come true, you could see where most industries will need to reshore a lot of investment,\u201d said Ricks, who attended last week\u2019s meeting with the president. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this quickly, because I think there will be constraints in everything from supply chain of building materials to energy.\u201d\n\nRicks emphasized that the plan to build so many new plants in the US relies on renewal of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in Trump\u2019s first term, which lowered the corporate tax rate in the US to 21% from 35%.\n\nIf those policies aren\u2019t extended, he said, \u201cWe\u2019d have to re-look at the whole thing.\u201d\n\nIncreasing US manufacturing of pharmaceuticals emerged as a more urgent priority during the Covid-19 pandemic as supply disruptions and concerns about access to crucial medicines laid bare the vulnerability of relying on imports from other countries.\n\nStill, much of that reliance \u2013 in particular, on China and India \u2013 is for generic medicines, Ricks pointed out, noting that Lilly doesn\u2019t make those drugs. The new plants will largely support new medicines, including future drugs in the same class as Zepbound and Mounjaro as well as medicines for cancer, immunology and neuroscience, Ricks said.\n\n\u201cThat said,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s dangerous for our country to have offshored production for whole types of technology like small-molecule synthesis, which is really not happening in our country at all anymore.\u201d\n\nSmall-molecule drugs typically include oral tablets, using chemistry for manufacturing.\n\n\u201cLilly here, now, will have three massive plants,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in a time of a pandemic or something like that, could we repurpose it? Sure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not determined where the new plants, which are expected to start making medicines within five years, will be; Lilly said it\u2019s in negotiations with several states and welcomes expressions of interest until March 12. The company estimates that the plants will create 13,000 jobs in manufacturing and construction.\n\nThey add to the US manufacturing sites Lilly\u2019s built since 2020, with commitments to invest a total of $50 billion with Wednesday\u2019s pledge. The company has been rapidly working to increase manufacturing capacity to meet outsized demand for Zepbound and Mounjaro, which \u2013 along with competitor drugs in the GLP-1 class, Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy \u2013 spent two years in shortage.\n\n\u201cRight now, for good or bad, we\u2019re running our plants globally 24/7, 365,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single hour of any day that every machine isn\u2019t working at Lilly right now, and that\u2019s not a sustainable thing for our teams and for doing the right scheduled maintenance and those sorts of things, but we\u2019re keeping up with runaway demand.\u201d\n\nRicks said \u201cnext-generation projects\u201d aim to build on the weight-loss success of Zepbound, including a pill in development called orforglipron that\u2019s expected to have results from a late-stage clinical trial \u201cin the next three months or so\u201d and a medicine called retatrutide that Ricks called \u201csort of the next super weight-loss drug from Lilly.\u201d\n\nUsed by millions of Americans, approved medicines in the class have revolutionized the way doctors approach weight loss, something Ricks pointed to as a way to help meet the Make America Healthy Again goals of the Trump administration and its health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n\u201cWhat could be more important than controlling obesity?\u201d Ricks said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the single biggest lever that exists\u201d for affecting health outcomes, \u201cand we\u2019re at the forefront of that.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Kennedy has sent mixed messages about his support for obesity medicines, saying in October that drugmakers sell them to Americans \u201cbecause we\u2019re so stupid and addicted to drugs.\u201d\n\nAsked about them during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy called them \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d but said they shouldn\u2019t be \u201cthe first front-line intervention for 6-year-olds, for whom they are currently\u201d \u2013 a false statement, as the medicines approved for kids are cleared starting at age 12.\n\n\u201cI find him to ask good questions and be a good listener; I think he\u2019s hungry for information,\u201d Ricks said of his interactions with Kennedy. \u201cWe\u2019ll push back when the science is clear and collaborate where we can. I think there\u2019s a lot more of the second than the first, from my initial impressions.\u201d",

At the time, Lilly said the doses were also \"priced at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of all other incretin (GLP-1) medicines for obesity.\"\n\nGLP-1 agonists are a class of Type 2 diabetes drugs that improve blood sugar control but may also lead to weight loss.

            "content": "Eli Lilly on Tuesday released higher doses of its weight loss drug Zepbound in single-dose vials at as much as half its usual monthly list price to reach more patients without insurance coverage for the blockbuster injection, such as those with Medicare.\n\nIt expands the company's effort to boost the U.S. supply of Zepbound as demand soars, and to ensure eligible patients are safely accessing the real treatment instead of cheaper compounded versions.\n\nEli Lilly is now offering higher doses of Zepbound in single-dose vials through a \"self-pay pharmacy\" section on its direct-to-consumer website, LillyDirect, which began offering lower doses of the drug in vials in August. Eligible patients diagnosed by a health-care provider with obesity alone or along with obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 Zepbound's newly approved use \u2014 can pay for those vials themselves on the site.\n\nThe company is selling 7.5 milligram and 10 milligram vials of Zepbound for $499 per month when patients fill their first prescription, and any time they refill within 45 days of their previous delivery. Otherwise, those two doses will cost $599 and $699, respectively.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Eli Lilly said it is lowering the price of both of the lower-dose vials of Zepbound by $50. The 2.5 milligram vial will now cost $349, and the 5 milligram vial will now be priced at $499, according to a release.\n\nPatients must use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine from a single-dose vial and inject themselves. That differs from single-dose autoinjector pens, the currently available form of all Zepbound doses, which patients can directly inject under their skin with the click of a button.\n\nEli Lilly has said those vials will make more of the medication available because they are easier to manufacture than autoinjector pens, which cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance.\n\nPatients typically start treatment with a 2.5 milligram dose for four weeks, then gradually increase the amount per week and later take so-called maintenance doses to keep the weight off. Eli Lilly does not currently offer the highest doses of Zepbound \u2014 12.5 milligrams and 15 milligrams \u2014 in single-dose vials.\n\nThe lower price points for each of the single-dose vials will benefit patients who are willing to pay for Zepbound themselves and are enrolled in Medicare or employer-sponsored health plans that do not cover obesity treatments.\n\n\"We are, in the absence of full coverage for people suffering from obesity like other chronic diseases, we are just trying to fill that room and provide a more affordable solution, particularly for the Medicare population because none of our affordability solutions can be applied to them,\" said Patrik Jonsson, president of Eli Lilly diabetes and obesity, in an interview.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries are also not eligible for Eli Lilly's savings card programs for Zepbound. Jonsson said \"in an ideal world,\" the Trump administration will enact a proposed rule from the Biden administration to have Medicare cover obesity medications. Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been skeptical of weight loss drugs.\n\nSome people turned to compounding pharmacies that make even cheaper copies of Zepbound because the branded treatment has been too costly and was in shortage until recent months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has since declared the Zepbound shortage over, however, which will soon bar many compounding pharmacies from making those versions of the drug.\n\nJonsson said Eli Lilly is \"not price competing with the compounders,\" adding that the company does not believe \"there is still a market for the mass compounding anymore.\"\n\nHe said Tuesday's announcement helps to ensure that patients \"don't rely on knockoffs that are not approved by the FDA for safety, efficacy and quality.\"",

Lilly also launched larger-dose vials of 7.5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, each costing $499 per one-month supply.\n\nWhat this means for Eli Lilly\n\nRegarding the first news item, Lilly said it will pay Organovo an up-front payment of an unspecified amount, as well as milestone payments (also unspecified), which will be paid out \"as FXR314 achieves key regulatory and commercial milestones.\" Lilly will acquire \"all commercial and intellectual property rights to Organovo's FXR program for worldwide development.\"\n\nOn the higher-profile GLP-1 diet drug news, Lilly cut the monthly, four-dose price of:\n\n5 mg Zepbound to $349 per month, and\n\n5 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10 mg Zepbound to $499 per month.\n\nThe 7.5-mg and 10-mg doses of Zepbound will be sold as part of \"the Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program.\" Lilly advised that the prices for these higher-dose formulas will be for the first fill of a prescription, and for refills that occur within 45 days of the first delivery.

Late last year, GSK made headlines for being a serial collaborator, but now there\u2019s a new sheriff in town \u2013 Eli Lilly. This year has seen the U.S.-headquartered biopharma sign several licensing deals to bolster its position across a range of therapeutic areas.\n\nTable of contents\n\nThe Eli Lilly and Alchemab partnership to discover treatments for ALS\n\nEli Lilly kicked off the year collaborating with British startup Alchemab Therapeutics to discover and develop five antibodies with the help of the latter\u2019s antibody discovery platform to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare neurological condition that has no cure to date.\n\nEarly symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, gradually increasing weakness, and muscle wasting that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles, leading to difficulties in speaking, swallowing, walking, and breathing. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, although this can vary.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s place in the ALS space is growing since it paid $45 million to Massachusetts-based QurAlis for its preclinical antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to restore UNC13A function \u2013 a gene linked to ALS in June. It also joined the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) on its quest to track down biomarkers for ALS last year.\n\nThe Eli Lilly-Alchemab partnership came as the therapeutic area faced a blow with California-based Calico Labs\u2019 and Denali Therapeutics\u2019 ALS drugs failing in phase 2/3 trials.\n\nEli Lilly partner with Mediar to tackle lung disease\n\nSoon after the deal with Alchemab, Eli Lilly announced its $99 million collaboration with Massachusetts-based Mediar Therapeutics for yet another antibody, but this time around, for the chronic respiratory illness idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The candidate MTX-463 is a human IgG1 antibody designed to neutralize WISP1-mediated fibrotic signaling in IPF. The phase 1 study recently ended, and Eli Lilly will begin phase 2 trials for the drug, after which, if successful, it will complete clinical development and take on commercialization.\n\nApart from the upfront payment, Eli Lilly will spend up to $687 million in milestone payments. Mark Genovese, senior vice president of Eli Lilly Immunology development, expressed that Eli Lilly is keen on \u201cfostering innovation\u201d through the partnership.\n\nEli Lilly buys Scorpion\u2019s PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor drug for breast cancer\n\nAlso in January 2025, Eli Lilly bet big on breast cancer therapeutics. It penned a deal to buy Massachusetts-based Scorpion Therapeutics\u2019 PI3K\u03b1 pipeline for up to $2.5 billion to beat fellow market rivals Novartis and Roche, which own PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors Piqray and Itovebi \u2013 both U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breast cancer drugs \u2013 respectively.\n\nNow owned by Eli Lilly, STX-478 is a once-daily oral, mutant-selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial for breast cancer and other advanced solid tumors.\n\n\u201cPI3K\u03b1 mutations occur in a meaningful proportion of hormone-positive breast cancers, and there is significant unmet need for new treatment options that effectively and safely target this pathway,\u201d said Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president and president of Eli Lilly Oncology. \u201cThe selectivity profile of STX-478 has led to a differentiated clinical profile, enabling use in combinations with standard-of-care therapies to potentially deliver meaningful impact in earlier treatment settings when there is the best opportunity to improve outcomes for patients.\u201d\n\nThe candidate STX-478 is believed to have an edge over Piqray and Itovebi after phase 1 results revealed that a 23% overall response rate (ORR) was achieved in breast cancer, 21% in all tumors, and 72% of patients on STX-478 had tumor reductions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Eli Lilly\u2019s first time testing a PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor for breast cancer. It canned its PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor LOXO-783 in August for not being efficacious enough.\n\nEli Lilly nabs rights to MASH drug\n\nThen, this month, Eli Lilly invested in yet another cancer drug as well as in the field of cardiometabolic disorders. Its pact with South Korean biotech OliX Pharmaceuticals was in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a chronic liver disease that occurs when fat builds up in the liver and the liver becomes inflamed.\n\nThe partnership gives Eli Lilly the global licensing rights of OLX75016, which is meant to reduce liver fat content as well as inflammation and liver fibrosis. A phase 1 trial is ongoing for OLX75016 in Australia.\n\nIn MASH, this isn\u2019t Eli Lilly\u2019s first rodeo. Its candidate tirzepatide was found to have had \u201cclinically meaningful\u201d results in a phase 2 trial in patients with MASH last year. Tirzepatide is the active substance in Lilly\u2019s GLP-1 agonist diabetes and obesity drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nRadiopharma: The big pharma making its mark\n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly seems to have a stronghold in the cancer therapeutics space, particularly in radiopharmaceuticals. Its licensing agreement with Australian startup AdvanCell was revealed two weeks ago. Leveraging AdvanCell\u2019s Pb-212 production technology and radionuclide development infrastructure and Eli Lilly\u2019s drug candidate programs, the two will create radiopharmaceutical therapies.\n\n\u201cBy combining our groundbreaking isotope production capabilities, our team\u2019s expertise and infrastructure with Eli Lilly\u2019s pharmaceutical and oncology expertise and global scale, we aim to bring transformative treatments to patients with hard-to-treat cancers. It is especially pleasing to continue and expand our existing relationship,\u201d said Andrew Adamovich, CEO of AdvanCell.\n\nLast year, the pharma giant paid $60 million to Massachusetts-based Aktis Oncology and $140 million to California-based Radionetics to pursue radiopharmaceutical development. This was following its $1.4 billion acquisition of American radiopharmaceuticals developer Point Biopharma in 2023. It\u2019s safe to say ELi Lilly isn\u2019t in the dark about R&D in the radiopharmaceutical space.\n\nBehind the scene: GLP-1 gives Eli Lilly a boost\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s 2024 fourth quarter could point to why Eli Lilly has been enthusiastic about ramping up R&D partnerships. Its revenue almost doubled \u2013 45% \u2013 to $13.53 billion since last year. Much of this is thanks to the whopping sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro alone brought in $3.5 billion towards the end of 2024.\n\n\u201c2024 was a highly successful year for Eli Lilly,\u201d said David A. Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly in a press release. \u201cWe had major data readouts for tirzepatide in treating chronic disease associated with obesity, invested billions more in expanding our manufacturing capacity, and launched Kisunla and Ebglyss \u2013 important drivers of our long-term balanced growth outlook. We enter 2025 with tremendous momentum and look forward to strong financial performance and several important phase 3 readouts, which, if positive, will further accelerate our long-term growth.\u201d\n\nEven its non-tirzepatide drugs had a 20% growth in sales since the fourth quarter of 2023. This includes its breast cancer drug Verzenio and its diabetes medicine Jardiance, which reaped about $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter of 2024, respectively.\n\nWhat makes licensing deals a good idea for the big pharma?\n\nEnthused by growing sales, Eli Lilly\u2019s recent deal-making spree may not come as a surprise. Just like GSK, which was signing licensing agreements while amassing \u00a331.4 billion ($39.69 billion) in 2024 \u2013 a 7% increase at constant exchange rates (CER).\n\nLicensing deals are actually a great way to enter the market and R&D horizon while decreasing risks, according to a report by EY. In the biopharma industry, the risk here is \u201cscience,\u201d explained a BioSpace report.\n\nSince new therapeutic technologies are cropping up, particularly in areas where there are no or few treatments, it can be less risky to forge licensing deals compared to mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Pharmas typically pay an upfront amount, then \u201clayer the deal on the back end with payments for development, regulatory, and commercial milestones,\u201d explained the BioSpace report.\n\nAlthough the milestone payments are often quoted in the billions, rarely do they end up getting paid out. Plus, the onus is on the biotech creating the technology or therapy to make their products a commercial success. However, M&As are often the approach taken when big pharmas want to fend off competition from smaller biopharmas in certain high-growth drug markets.\n\nAs Eli Lilly has signed nine major licensing deals in the past six months, it has been dipping its toes in a number of therapeutic areas such as cancer care, neurology, metabolic disorders, and heart diseases. It is investing in various technologies to potentially gain a significant hold in these markets in the future.",

            "content": "Few big pharma stocks have been bigger winners over the last three years than Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Lilly now ranks as the largest drugmaker in the world, with a market cap of $844 billion, after its shares skyrocketed more than 270%. Novo Nordisk stock is up around 75% despite a pullback in recent months.\n\nThere's no secret to their success: Both companies have blockbuster weight-loss drugs. But the obesity market could soon have a new contender. Wall Street thinks this weight-loss drug stock could more than 3x over the next 12 months -- and it's not Eli Lilly or Novo Nordisk.\n\nAnalysts are bullish about this biotech stock\n\nViking Therapeutics' (VKTX 0.61%) share price currently hovers around $32. The average analysts' 12-month price target for the biotech stock is $99.29 -- more than 200% higher.\n\nThe great expectations for Viking Therapeutics aren't limited to only a few outlier analysts, though. Of the 17 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February who cover the stock, seven rated it as a \"strong buy.\" Another nine analysts viewed Viking as a \"buy.\" The remaining analyst recommended holding the stock.\n\nThis optimism on Wall Street remains pretty solid despite Viking's less-than-stellar performance over the past few months. The small drugmaker's share price has plunged nearly 60% since late October 2024.\n\nWhy the steep decline? Some investors were concerned about the outlook for weight-loss drugs after Donald Trump won a second term as president. Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Kennedy has expressed skepticism in the past about relying on medications to lose weight.\n\nAlso, Viking was seen by some as a potential acquisition target for Merck. However, Merck announced in December 2024 it was licensing Hansoh Pharma's obesity drug HS-10535. This move added a new (and potentially formidable) competitor for Viking and greatly reduced the likelihood that Merck would acquire the company.\n\nViking's promising pipeline\n\nWhy do many Wall Street analysts like Viking Therapeutics so much? It has an especially promising pipeline.\n\nThe company's lead pipeline candidate is subcutaneous VK-2735. Viking plans to advance the drug into phase 3 clinical studies in treating obesity in the second quarter of this year. VK-2735 is a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This is the same mechanism of action as Lilly's tirzepatide, which is marketed as Mounjaro in the U.S. for treating type 2 diabetes and as Zepbound for treating obesity.\n\nViking is also evaluating an oral tablet formulation of VK-2735 in phase 2 testing. The company thinks this tablet could be more attractive for patients who are reluctant to receive injections, or for those trying to maintain weight loss achieved with an injection.\n\nUnlike many clinical-stage biotech companies, though, Viking isn't a one-trick pony. Its pipeline includes another candidate that could soon advance into late-stage studies -- VK-2809. This experimental therapy targets the severe liver disease metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which is also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nAs they say on the infomercials, \"But wait! There's more!\" Viking is also evaluating VK-0214 in a phase 1 clinical trial as a potential treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a rare neurodegenerative disease. There are currently no approved drugs for treating X-ALD.\n\nShould you buy Viking Therapeutics stock?\n\nYou shouldn't buy Viking stock solely because Wall Street likes it. Clinical-stage biotech stocks aren't well-suited for risk-averse investors, and Viking is no exception. There's no guarantee that the company's pipeline programs will be successful.\n\nHowever, I think Viking Therapeutics could be a great pick for aggressive investors. The prospects for VK-2735 and VK-2809 appear to be good based on their phase 2 results. Viking's market cap is below $3.6 billion right now. If either or both of these drugs fulfill their potential, the company should be worth a lot more in a few years.",

This shortage opened a temporary but lucrative opportunity for compounding pharmacies, which the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits to produce copycat versions of branded drugs during officially declared shortages. In December 2024, the FDA abruptly determined that the tirzepatide shortage had resolved and removed these products from its shortage list, effectively terminating compounders' legal authority to produce these drugs. With the recent transition to the Trump administration\u2014whose leader has repeatedly criticized pharmaceutical companies for \"getting away with murder\" on pricing and specifically targeted the cost of weight loss medications\u2014I have wondered whether the FDA might reverse course under new leadership and side with compounders offering lower-priced alternatives. The FDA's new court filing indicates that the agency is standing firmly with patent holders and the drug approval system that grants market exclusivity. [FDA Brief ZepBound]\n\nThe compounding pharmacies have been providing much cheaper versions of the drugs and apparently different dosing regimens.\n\nA number of plaintiffs sued the FDA in 2024, seeking a preliminary injunction to permit ongoing compounding. Outsourcing Facilities Ass'n v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., No. 4:24-cv-00953-P (N.D. Tex. filed 2024). In its brief opposing the preliminary injunction, the FDA defends its data-driven conclusion that \"Lilly's supply is currently exceeding demand and will meet or exceed projected demand across all strengths of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\" The FDA's determination relied heavily on confidential data provided by Lilly. I expect that this brief will effectively end the case for the plaintiffs, although they will likely continue to fight for some time.",

            "content": "Supplies of high-demand obesity treatments are improving, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easier to get them.\n\nMany employers and insurers are scaling back coverage of Wegovy and Zepbound and a key government program, Medicare, doesn\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity. Meanwhile, some big employers are adding coverage, but their commitment isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nTreatment prices that can top hundreds of dollars monthly even after discounts make it hard for many people to afford these drugs on their own. That can make the life-changing weight loss that patients seek dependent on the coverage they have and how long it lasts.\n\nCoverage complications are not unusual in the U.S. health care system. But the challenge is magnified for these obesity treatments because a wide swath of the population could be eligible to take them, and patients have to stay on the drugs to keep the weight off.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people right now who want access to the medication and can\u2019t get it,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation senior policy adviser.\n\nCoverage varies depending on who pays the bill\n\nPaul Mack dropped about 70 pounds after he started taking Wegovy. The Redwood City, California, resident said food noise \u2014 constant thoughts of eating \u2014 faded, and he was able to have a heart procedure.\n\nThe treatment was covered by California\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. Then the 50-year-old security guard got a raise. He no longer qualified for Medi-Cal and lost coverage of the drug for several months starting last summer.\n\nHe regained two pants sizes.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t control the eating,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the noise came back.\u201d\n\nCoverage of these drugs remains patchy more than a year after Zepbound entered the market to challenge Wegovy.\n\nThe benefits consultant Mercer says 44% of U.S. companies with 500 or more employees covered obesity drugs last year. It\u2019s even more common with bigger employers.\n\nMore than a dozen government-funded Medicaid programs for people with low incomes also cover obesity treatments.\n\nBut few insurers cover the drugs on individual insurance marketplaces. And some plans restrict their coverage with things like requests for prior authorization or pre-approval.\n\nThe lack of Medicare coverage remains a concern as well, especially for people who retire and move to the government-funded program from employer-sponsored coverage.\n\n\u201cPatients come to us terrified about switching to Medicare and losing coverage,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and cofounder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. \u201cWe start talking about backup plans a year before they transition.\u201d\n\nCost and uncertain payoff loom as concerns payer concerns\n\nPhiladelphia-area insurer Independence Blue Cross dropped coverage of the drugs solely for weight loss for some customers starting this year. Company officials say the insurer worried about premium hikes it would have to impose on all customers if it continued.\n\nCost also was a factor in decisions by West Virginia and North Carolina officials to end similar programs that provided coverage for state employees.\n\nThese concerns make Vanderbilt University researcher Stacie Dusetzina wonder how long employers who have added coverage will keep it, now that the drugs are no longer in short supply.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to spike spending,\u201d said Dusetzina, a health policy professor who studies drug costs.\n\nDrugmakers tout the savings these drugs can provide by improving patient health and warding off future serious medical conditions like heart attacks or strokes.\n\nBut health care experts note that there are no guarantees that the employer or insurer who covers the drug will eventually reap those benefits because people may change jobs or insurers.\n\nWill coverage ever become consistent?\n\nThere\u2019s no clear path toward widespread coverage of these drugs for obesity, even as polls show Americans favor having Medicaid and Medicare cover the costs.\n\nLeaders at Zepbound maker Eli Lilly have seen coverage grow steadily for their drug, and they\u2019re optimistic that will continue.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a rule that would allow for Medicare and broader Medicaid coverage. Its fate remains uncertain in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nA bill calling for Medicare coverage has been floating around Congress for years. But it isn\u2019t scheduled for a vote.\n\nDrugmakers are currently testing several additional obesity treatments. Such potential competition could reduce prices and prompt more coverage.\n\nPatchy coverage complicates treatment plans\n\nDr. Amy Rothberg says the lack of consistent coverage leaves her conflicted about writing prescriptions because she\u2019s not sure how long patients will be able to take the drug.\n\n\u201cWe know from the studies that people go off these medications, they regain their weight,\u201d said Rothberg, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s weight-management program. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do harm.\u201d\n\nSome insurers require diet and exercise changes for the patient before they will cover a weight-loss medication. Those changes should happen in conjunction with starting the medicine, said Dr. Lydia Alexander, president of the Obesity Medicine Association.\n\nShe\u2019s also seen requirements for a body mass index of 40 or more, which equates to severe obesity, before coverage can start.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying that obesity is a disease, but we\u2019re not treating it like a disease,\u201d she said.\n\n____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other top stocks to buy according to sustainable insight capital management.\n\nSustainable Insight Capital Management (SICM) focuses on institutional investments, offering both long-only and long-short strategies in public equities. Established by an experienced leadership team with deep institutional knowledge, the hedge fund is committed to providing investment solutions that emphasize sustainability. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, SICM reported managing nearly $228.52 million in 13F securities, with its top 10 holdings making up 56.36% of its portfolio.\n\nKevin Edward Parker is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sustainable Insight Capital Management LLC, which he established in 2013. He also founded Sustainable Insight Capital Management (UK) Ltd. that same year and serves as its CEO as well. Parker earned his undergraduate degree from New York University in 1981.

Before launching SICM, Kevin Parker played a key role at Deutsche Bank, where he was a member of the Group Executive Committee from 2001 to 2004 and led its asset management division as Global Head from 2004 to 2012. His extensive expertise in sustainable investing and institutional asset management has positioned SICM as a leader in responsible investment strategies.\n\nBeyond his work at SICM, Parker holds several leadership positions in various organizations. Since 2004, he has also served as Vice Chairman of the New York Police & Fire Widow\u2019s & Children\u2019s Benefit Fund. Additionally, he has been an Independent Director at The Westaim Corporation since 2020, an Independent Non-Executive Director at United Co.

They are compiled in the ascending order of Sustainable Insight Capital Management\u2019s stake in them as of the fourth quarter of 2024. In order to assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1008 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 363.5% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 115\n\nSICM\u2019s Equity Stake: $6.54 Million\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has been at the forefront of scientific innovation for nearly 150 years, utilizing biotechnology, chemistry, and genetic medicine to address some of the world\u2019s most pressing health challenges. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) operates in 18 countries, with its products available in approximately 125 countries. In addition to its groundbreaking pharmaceutical developments, it also prioritizes inclusive clinical trials and strives to make its medicines accessible and affordable to diverse populations.\n\nOver the years, Lilly has developed a strong reputation for pioneering treatments, particularly in diabetes and mental health. It introduced widely used medications such as Prozac in 1986 for depression, Zyprexa in 1996 for schizophrenia, and Cymbalta in 2004 for depression and anxiety. In the field of diabetes care, Lilly\u2019s Humalog and Trulicity have been major revenue drivers. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was also the first to mass-produce both the polio vaccine and insulin. More recently, the company has made significant strides by developing more best-selling drugs such as Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nCurrently, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is making a significant investment in its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, by accumulating nearly $550 million in pre-launch inventory ahead of its expected 2026 release. This move, which was revealed in a recent financial filing, is uncommon as most pharmaceutical companies typically build inventory closer to regulatory approval. The strategy suggests that the company is aiming for a strong market entry to gain an early advantage over competitors in the weight-loss treatment sector. Currently, the company and Danish rival Novo Nordisk dominate this market with injectable medications, while Novo and other firms like AstraZeneca are also working on oral obesity treatments. Analysts estimate that Lilly\u2019s pre-launch inventory could translate into $10 billion in sales based on 2024 figures, with expectations of further expansion. The company\u2019s confidence in orforglipron is reinforced by promising mid-stage trial results, which showed a 14.7% weight reduction at the highest dose over 36 weeks. With late-stage data anticipated by April, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is already scaling up manufacturing to ensure a timely launch.\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company best known for developing and selling GLP-1 medications for diabetes and obesity. Shares detracted from performance as recent GLP-1 revenue results missed heightened expectations. We view Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro/Zepbound GLP-1/GIP drug as an important treatment for diabetic and non-diabetic obese patients and see Lilly continuing to innovate and develop more effective and convenient next-generation medications. Although manufacturing supply and access is limited in the near term, we think this class of drug should be the standard of care for both diabetes and obesity and will become a $150 billion category. We think the recent revenue miss related to the mistiming of demand-generation activities with supply increases and elevated investor expectations after a very strong result in the prior quarter. We think this market is in the early innings of uptake and the adoption of GLP-1s will triple Lilly\u2019s total revenues by 2030.\u201d\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 10th on our list of top stocks to buy according to sustainable insight capital management. While we acknowledge the potential for LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "The country\u2019s foremost expert on obesity has urged the Health Service Executive to make the \u2018King Kong\u2019 of weight loss drugs available free of charge.\n\nIt comes as the Irish Mail on Sunday has learned the drugs regulatory authority has received almost 900 reports of people suffering side effects from weight loss jabs such as Ozempic.\n\nToday's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProfessor Donal O\u2019Shea, a consultant endocrinologist and the HSE\u2019s National Clinical Lead for Obesity, said Mounjaro, which went on sale here this week, is \u2018a life-changing drug\u2019 that should not just be available to those who can afford to pay for the monthly jab.\n\nProfessor Donal O\u2019Shea, a consultant endocrinologist and the HSE\u2019s National Clinical Lead for Obesity, said Mounjaro, which went on sale here this week, is \u2018a life-changing drug\u2019 that should not just be available to those who can afford to pay for the monthly jab. Pic: Tom Honan\n\nDeveloped by pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, it can currently only be given to those who can get a private prescription at a cost of between \u20ac250 and \u20ac280 a month.\n\nProf O\u2019Shea told the MoS: \u2018Having Mounjaro available is very positive, we\u2019re delighted. But making it available only to people who can afford it, we are obviously very unhappy about that, and we would want to see that situation change as soon as is possible.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not the kind of society we want where inequality becomes greater with the emergence of these drugs. That\u2019s not something anybody working in the health system wants to see.\n\n\u2018We will be asking that the company make a submission to the HSE [for it to be on the Drugs Reimbursement Scheme] and the obesity programme will be strongly supporting the availability of this drug and other drugs that are going to be coming for the treatment of obesity.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not everybody with obesity has complications and these drugs are cost-effective for patients with complicated obesity. We\u2019ve been looking at obesity rates climbing for 30 years. Prevention is important in stopping people developing this disease. But once they have it, \u2018eat less, move more\u2019 is not the treatment.\n\nThey either need access to surgery or access to medication that is effective. \u2018But there haven\u2019t been effective medications until the last few years so getting access to it and having availability is a really important first step.\u2019\n\nMounjaro was dubbed the \u2018King Kong\u2019 of weight loss medication because of its effectiveness in treating obesity. After a year of monthly injections a severely overweight person can lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight \u2013 twice that of alternatives on the market such as Ozempic.\n\nAnd according to Prof O\u2019Shea, this is what makes the drug such a \u2018life-changing\u2019 medication. The lead clinician at Dublin\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s and St Columcille\u2019s hospitals said: \u2018With previous medicines you could hope somebody could lose 10 per cent maybe at best, sometimes five per cent would be very effective. With Mounjaro you are looking at 15 per cent weight loss and that\u2019s very significant clinically for somebody\u2019s health trajectory. It\u2019s life-changing.\u2019\n\nOzempic was developed to treat diabetes but has been hailed as a wonder weight-loss treatment and used by celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. Instead of taking a pill daily, those prescribed the medication have a weekly injection.\n\nA month\u2019s supply usually costs around \u20ac150 to buy here but is available for much less in some other countries. Wegovy, a version of Ozempic specifically for weight loss, has since been developed.\n\nHowever, Mounjaro can be given to people with type 2 diabetes as well as those who are obese or overweight. The dose given varies depending on whether it is prescribed for diabetes or weight loss.\n\nMounjaro only became legally available in Ireland on Monday.\n\nHowever, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) have been seizing illicit stocks of the drug for the past year.\n\nFigures provided by the HPRA show that, between January and November 2024, up to 1,469 units of Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro were seized. Most of these medications were bought online.\n\nA HPRA spokeswoman said: \u2018These prescriptions are all illegal prescription medicines. There is limited information about their sources, manufacturing conditions or safety. Any such products promoted online are likely falsified and potentially dangerous to those who take them.\u2019 The HPRA also confirmed it has been notified of 859 reports of suspected side effects \u2018associated with semaglutide-containing medicine\u2019, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nCommon side effects from taking weight loss medications such as Ozempic include nausea, dehydration, diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\nAn inquest into the death of Cork grandmother Breeda O\u2019Donoghue last month found the 66-year-old died from total organ failure less than three months after being prescribed Ozempic.\n\nThe mother-of-two had type 2 diabetes and had been taking separate medication for this condition. She was prescribed Ozempic in September 2023 after gaining weight. State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster, said she died from total organ failure. Cork City Coroner Philip Comyn concluded her death was caused by a known complication of a prescribed medication.\n\nWeight loss expert Dr Ninnette de Klerk of the Ailesbury Clinic in Dublin this weekend warned about the use of Ozempic and Mounjaro as \u2018skinny jabs\u2019, and urged severely overweight people to seek medical advice if they want to avoid developing saggy skin and the dreaded \u2018Ozempic\u2019 wrinkly skin from drastic weight loss.\n\nDr de Klerk told the MoS: \u2018People should not see these drugs as a skinny jab and as a way of losing a few kilos with these injections. That is not what they are for.\n\n\u2018These drugs are to treat the disease of obesity, and they are not for people who are a little overweight and want to lose a few kilos. If it\u2019s prescribed to the right people, it\u2019s life changing.\u2019\n\nEli Lilly yesterday confirmed it was seeking HSE approval for the medication to be included in the Drug Refund Scheme. A spokeswoman told the MoS: \u2018We are fully engaged and working with the NCPE (National Centre of Pharma Economics) to make Mounjaro available as widely as possible, in line with its therapeutic indication.\u2019 A HSE spokeswoman said that \u2018applications for Mounjaro remain under consideration\u2019.",

(NASDAQ: BIOA) pursuant and/or traceable to BioAge\u2019s registration statement for the initial public offering conducted on September 26, 2024 (the \u201cIPO\u201d), of the important March 10, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased BioAge stock you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the BioAge class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=33167 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 10, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants touted its lead product candidate azelaprag in connection with BioAge\u2019s ongoing STRIDES clinical trial with expectations of topline results in 2025. Defendants also mentioned its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s (\u201cLilly\u201d) Chorus clinical development organization who would be advising and assisting on all aspects of the STRIDES trial design and execution. Defendants further discussed the potential for a second Phase 2 clinical trial combining azelaprag and semaglutide to treat obesity in individuals ages 18 years and older. Therefore, the IPO represented to the public that there were no safety concerns and BioAge expected top line results and to meet its primary endpoint goals in connection with its STRIDES clinical trial.\n\nContrary to these representations, BioAge discontinued the ongoing STRIDES Phase 2 study of its investigational drug candidate azelaprag after several subjects showed elevated levels of liver enzymes warning of potential organ damage. As a result, defendants discontinued the clinical trial and halted further enrollment. Given the fact that defendants failure to disclose the potential for liver transaminitis in any of its previous clinical Phase 1 trials and various preclinical tox studies, defendants\u2019 statements in BioAge\u2019s registration statement were false and/or materially misleading at the time of the IPO. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the BioAge class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=33167 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm, on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) share price is up a whopping 593% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 17% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.\n\nSince the stock has added US$25b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Eli Lilly\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Eli Lilly achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 47% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 74.10.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nNYSE:LLY Earnings Per Share Growth February 22nd 2025\n\nWe know that Eli Lilly has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Eli Lilly, it has a TSR of 637% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.",

            "content": "In a sense, every investor is a growth investor. Even those who are primarily seeking income enjoy when the stocks they buy increase in value. But which stocks are likely to deliver growth over the next few years?\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors think they've found magnificent growth stocks to buy right now. Here's why they picked AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX).\n\nAstraZeneca is an underrated growth stock with tons of potential\n\nDavid Jagielski (AstraZeneca): One of the best growth stocks right now is AstraZeneca. The stock hasn't been the hottest buy of late, and entering trading this week it was down more than 11% over the past six months. But there's tremendous value here if you're willing to buy and hold.\n\nThe company wrapped up a solid year in 2024 where its revenue rose by 21% (when excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to $54 billion. And for this year, it's projecting its top line to continue to increase in the high single digits. But the real upside is for investors who are willing to buy and hold. That's because by 2030, AstraZeneca expects sales to soar to $80 billion as it launches new medications in the years ahead.\n\nAstraZeneca sees significant growth opportunities in expanding its oncology, biopharmaceutical, and rare-disease portfolios. With a diversified product mix, it's in an excellent position to continue growing at a rapid pace, and acquisitions have played a big part in its growth. It has closed multiple deals within the past 12 months, including for Amolyt Pharma and Fusion Pharmaceuticals. It's working on next-gen cancer treatments involving radioconjugates.\n\nNot only are the company's growth prospects promising, but the stock's valuation also looks incredible as it's trading at a price-to-earnings-growth multiple of around 0.9, which tells investors that there's excellent value here given the long-term potential for the business to grow its bottom line in the years ahead. Plus, with a dividend that yields 2%, there's some good incentive for investors to buy and wait for this magnificent growth stock to realize its potential and rise higher in value in the future.\n\nNot just a diabetes and weight loss company\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): The title of \"largest therapeutic area in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of revenue\" might go to oncology or immunology, but right now, the weight loss space may be the fastest-growing.

            "content": "NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against BioAge Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIOA) and certain of its senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in BioAge, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nInvestors have until March 10, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of investors who purchased stock pursuant and/or traceable to BioAge\u2019s registration statement for its initial public offering held on or about September 26, 2024. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Soto v. BioAge Labs, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-196.\n\nWhy was BioAge Sued under the Federal Securities Laws?\n\nBioAge Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of therapeutic products for metabolic diseases, with a primary focus on obesity. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, azelaprag, is an orally available small-molecule agonist of the apelin receptor (APJ), designed to enhance weight loss.\n\nAs alleged, BioAge\u2019s IPO documents discussed its ongoing STRIDES Phase 2 trial of azelaprag in combination with GLP-1R agonists for enhanced weight loss. BioAge stated that it was collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cLilly\u201d) in connection with STRIDES, and that Lilly would be advising and assisting on all aspects of the trial\u2019s design and execution. BioAge also stated that it anticipated topline results in Q3 2025 and discussed the potential for a second Phase 2 clinical trial. As alleged, BioAge\u2019s statements conveyed to investors that there were no safety concerns and that it expected top line results to meet its primary endpoint goals.\n\nIn truth, BioAge was forced to discontinue the STRIDES Phase 2 trial after several subjects exhibited elevated liver enzyme levels, indicating potential organ damage. Consequently, the Company terminated the trial and ceased further enrollment.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn December 6, 2024, BioAge announced that it discontinued its STRIDES Phase 2 trial for azelaprag, citing safety concerns, after liver transaminitis was observed in subjects receiving azelaprag. The Company stated that the decision to discontinue the STRIDES trial of azelaprag \u201cbecame clear\u201d due to \u201cthe emerging safety profile of the current doses tested[.]\u201d This news caused the price of BioAge stock to decline over 76%, from a closing price of $20.09 per share on December 6, 2024, to $4.65 per share on December 9, 2024.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in BioAge you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

            "content": "Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Zepbound cost $900 to $1,500 for a month's supply.\n\nThey cost so much partly because of the time and money it took to develop them, Eli Lilly's CEO said.\n\nDrugmakers want to capture a fair share of the value they create before patents expire, David Ricks said.\n\nThe latest weight-loss drugs including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound have list prices ranging from $900 to $1,500 for a one-month supply.\n\nDavid Ricks, the CEO of Mounjaro and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly, explained why these medications are so expensive on the \"In Good Company with Nicolai Tangen\" podcast this week.\n\n1. Time and money\n\nDeveloping a new drug costs about $3 billion, takes around 15 years, and has a high chance of failing, Ricks said.\n\nThe huge costs, long timeframes, and slim probability of success means \"the return on that risk needs to be substantial,\" said the boss of America's 10th-largest company that's worth nearly $830 billion. The stock has risen 17% in the past year, and more than 500% since 2019.\n\nOnce a drug is approved and being used by millions, there will often be calls for cost-plus pricing, Ricks said. But without the prospect of large profits, \"no one would have undertaken the risks to invent it.\"\n\n2. Profit window\n\nBy the time their latest wonder drug is approved and hits the market, pharma companies only have about 10 to 12 years to cash in before their patent expires and rivals can produce cheaper generics, Ricks said.\n\nDrug pricing reflects the limited timeframe they have to recoup their investment, earn sufficient profits to satisfy shareholders, and offset the cost of their many failed medications.\n\nDavid Ricks is CEO of Eli Lilly, one of America's biggest companies. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\n3. Broad benefits\n\nWhen a drug patent expires, other drugmakers quickly roll out generics at a fraction of the price, stopping the inventor from earning monopoly profits but making the medication accessible to almost anyone who needs it.\n\n\"One of the great gifts of our industry is that everything we invent goes to zero for us and goes to infinity for society because generic drugs are such a great deal,\" Ricks said.\n\nRicks pointed to Prozac, which Eli Lilly introduced in the late 1980s. The antidepressant is sold around the world and \"virtually free\" as it costs only four or five cents a day in major markets, he said. He called it a \"tremendous gift to society,\" and said his company deserves more credit for those long-term benefits while their drugs are under patent.\n\n4. Fair share\n\nWhen a new medication reduces costs for entire healthcare systems, its creators deserve a share of the savings, Ricks said.\n\nHe highlighted research suggesting the new generation of weight-loss drugs reduces worker absences, results in fewer hip and knee replacements, and can help with conditions ranging from alcoholism and depression to schizophrenia.\n\nTheir effectiveness in fighting conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes could eat into 40% of the total healthcare costs of developed countries, Ricks said.\n\nEli Lilly aims to \"capture some, not all, of the direct and indirect value we create,\" he added.\n\nRelated stories\n\n5. Ethics and regulation\n\nPharma companies could price their drugs based on what the market can bear, but Ricks said that would be unwise.\n\nThere could be \"desperate people who need a medication to survive,\" meaning \"you can get into price points that are really exorbitant and maybe make a short-term return, but you'll probably be either legislated or sued out of business if you pursue that forever,\" he said.\n\nRicks said his team consults with healthcare systems and weighs financial, scientific, and customer perspectives to ensure its prices reflect the value of its drugs without being exploitative and inviting legal or regulatory backlash.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +13.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Lilly falls in, has gained 10.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLilly is expected to post earnings of $4.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +75.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.48 points to a change of +80.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.12 indicates a change of +32.5% from what Lilly is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lilly.",

            "content": "New York, USA, Feb. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evolving Landscape of Obesity: Key Market Insights of Latest Published Different Types of Obesity | DelveInsight\n\nThe obesity market size is projected to witness growth from 2024 to 2034 due to the rising prevalence of obesity. This expansion is expected to be further influenced by the extensive pipeline of emerging drugs, characterized by lower safety risks and improved profiles, throughout the study period.\n\nObesity is the second leading cause of preventable death and is linked to the development of inflammatory conditions that contribute directly and indirectly to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disorders, psychological challenges, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, cancer, and hyperlipidemia. It represents a major public health crisis that has steadily worsened over the past 50 years.\n\nThe prevalence of obesity has risen among both children and adults, affecting individuals of all genders in both developed and developing nations. In 2023, the total Prevalent population of Obesity in the United States was ~114 million cases, which as per DelveInsight\u2019s estimates, is expected to increase by 2034.\n\nObesity management primarily focuses on reducing body weight and fat percentage to lower related health risks. Approaches include dietary changes, various forms of exercise, behavioral therapy, lifestyle modifications, medication, and surgical procedures such as intragastric balloons, bariatric surgery, and laparoscopic gastric banding.\n\nDespite the availability of approved obesity treatments, particularly pharmacotherapy, their usage remains limited due to factors like insurance coverage, cost, safety concerns, and doubts about effectiveness. FDA-approved medications include CONTRAVE (naltrexone-bupropion), SAXENDA (liraglutide), XENICAL (orlistat), QSYMIA (phentermine-topiramate), WEGOVY (semaglutide), and IMCIVREE (setmelanotide). Since obesity is not an immediate life-threatening condition, ensuring the safety of these drugs is a top priority.\n\nSeveral pharma companies such as Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, MedImmune, Boehringer Ingelheim, Raziel Therapeutics, Altimmune, Saniona, YSOPIA Bioscience, Innovent Biologics, Glaceum, Shionogi, Aardvark Therapeutics, NuSirt Biopharma, Novartis, CSPC Baike (Shandong) Biopharmaceutical, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Carmot Therapeutics, Pfizer, Sciwind Biosciences, Empros Pharma, and others are involved in developing drugs for obesity.\n\nThe expected launch of potential therapies in the market by key players during the forecast period (2024\u20132034), shall create a positive impact on the market size of Obesity in the 7MM. Moreover, the dynamics of the Obesity market are anticipated to change in the coming years owing to the development of disease-modifying treatment options.\n\nDiscover more about the obesity market in detail @ Obesity Market Report\n\nDelveInsight has expertise in the nutritional disorders market, and an experienced team handles the nutritional disorders domain proficiently. DelveInsight has recently released a series of epidemiology-based market reports on different types of obesity including Hypothalamic Obesity, Pediatric Obesity, HET Obesity/POMC Deficiency Obesity, Syndromic and Monogenic Obesity, and Pro-Opiomelanocortin (POMC) Deficiency Obesity & Leptin Receptor (LEPR) Deficiency Obesity. These reports include a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, emerging drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2020 to 2034 segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\n\nAdditionally, the reports feature an examination of prominent companies working with their lead candidates in different stages of clinical development. Let\u2019s deep dive into the market assessment of these obesity types individually.\n\nHypothalamic Obesity Market\n\nHypothalamic obesity is characterized by excessive weight gain resulting from damage to the hypothalamus, a crucial brain region responsible for various functions. The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating both food intake and energy expenditure. When it is damaged, the balance between calorie consumption and burning is disrupted, often leading to increased food intake, reduced energy expenditure, and rapid weight gain.\n\nAccording to findings, in the United States, a variety of etiologies causing hypothalamic obesity were reported out of which 86% of patients reported having developed hypothalamic obesity as a result of a brain tumor or tumor treated by surgery, with or without associated cranial radiation.\n\nDiagnosis of hypothalamic obesity involves a physical examination, including anthropometric measurements and vital signs, as well as a review of medical history, previous weight management efforts, exercise habits, and family history. Laboratory tests may also be conducted to identify potential complications such as fatty liver disease and obesity-related diabetes.\n\nCurrently, there are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for hypothalamic obesity. Management primarily focuses on addressing the underlying condition and associated health issues while exploring various strategies to control obesity. However, the condition is often resistant to treatment. The approach includes optimizing pituitary hormone replacement, implementing dietary strategies (such as controlled carbohydrate intake and portion control), promoting physical activity, and incorporating mental and behavioral health interventions.\n\nIn some cases, weight-loss medications or metabolic/bariatric surgery may be considered. While surgical interventions tend to have the most significant impact, other treatments generally offer only modest benefits, which may not be effective for all patients. Certain medications, including stimulants, metformin, and GLP1R agonists, have shown potential benefits for some individuals.\n\nCompanies like LG Chem and Rhythm Pharmaceuticals are actively developing and testing new treatment candidates at various clinical stages, aiming to provide effective therapeutic options for hypothalamic obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a comprehensive view of the hypothalamic obesity market, check out the Hypothalamic Obesity Market Assessment\n\nPediatric Obesity Market\n\nPediatric obesity is typically determined using body mass index (BMI), which measures weight relative to squared height. In the US, the CDC classifies pediatric obesity as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, while severe obesity is defined as exceeding 120% of the 95th percentile or surpassing 35 kg/m\u00b2, based on age- and sex-specific growth charts. This condition represents a major public health issue, necessitating a comprehensive strategy for prevention and treatment.\n\nIn 2023, there were approximately 8 million prevalent cases of obesity among children aged 5 to 19 in the 7MM. Given current lifestyle trends, this number is expected to increase at a significant rate. Early detection and intervention are essential to mitigating the long-term health risks associated with childhood obesity.\n\nObesity and related non-communicable diseases can largely be prevented and managed. Individuals can lower their risk by adopting preventive measures throughout different life stages, starting from pre-conception and continuing through early childhood. Treatment for pediatric obesity involves a multifaceted approach, including lifestyle modifications, medications, and, in some cases, weight-loss surgery.\n\nFor adolescents aged 12 and older, the FDA has approved medications such as XENICAL, SAXENDA, and WEGOVY to support weight management when combined with lifestyle changes, helping to achieve significant weight loss. Early intervention remains key to reducing long-term complications and enhancing overall health outcomes.\n\nPharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly and others, are actively developing treatments for pediatric obesity, with various candidates in different phases of clinical trials. However, the current pipeline of emerging therapies remains insufficient to address the increasing demand, highlighting the urgent need for more advanced and effective treatment options for children with obesity.\n\nDiscover more about pediatric obesity drugs in development @ Pediatric Obesity Clinical Trials\n\nProopiomelanocortin (POMC) Deficiency Obesity Market\n\nPOMC deficiency obesity is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, resulting in severe early-onset obesity. Affected individuals typically experience rapid weight gain during infancy and significant obesity from a young age. Approximately 100-500 people are living with POMC deficiency in the United States.\n\nCurrently, treatment options are limited and primarily focus on symptom management through dietary and lifestyle modifications. The only approved therapy for POMC deficiency-related obesity is IMCIVREE (setmelanotide), developed by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.\n\nMelanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists are being explored as potential treatments, aiming to restore the disrupted melanocortin pathway. These therapies have shown promise in reducing appetite and supporting weight loss, with some advancing in clinical trials. However, the pipeline for POMC deficiency obesity remains underdeveloped, with few key players involved. The most notable drug currently in development is LB54640 (LR19021) by LG Chem/Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDespite the limited pipeline, the market for POMC deficiency obesity is projected to grow, driven by advancements in targeted therapies such as MC4R agonists like setmelanotide. Greater awareness and improved genetic testing are expected to lead to earlier and more frequent diagnoses, thereby increasing the patient population.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the POMC obesity market, be sure to explore the Proopiomelanocortin Deficiency Obesity Market Outlook\n\nSyndromic and Monogenic Obesity Market\n\nSyndromic and monogenic obesity represent rare, genetically driven forms of the condition, distinct from polygenic or lifestyle-related obesity. Monogenic obesity results from single-gene mutations, typically affecting pathways related to appetite regulation, energy expenditure, and fat storage. Syndromic obesity, on the other hand, is associated with additional clinical manifestations such as developmental delays, dysmorphic features, and endocrine abnormalities.\n\nThe prevalence of monogenic obesity is estimated to be around 2\u20135% of severe early-onset obesity cases, whereas syndromic obesity is even rarer. Due to its genetic underpinnings, these forms of obesity often remain resistant to conventional weight management strategies like diet, exercise, and general anti-obesity medications. Currently, treatment options are limited, with lifestyle interventions proving largely ineffective. Bariatric surgery may be considered in severe cases, but its applicability is constrained in pediatric populations. Pharmacologic interventions are emerging, with targeted therapies aiming to address the underlying genetic causes.\n\nKey players, such as LG Chem, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Soleno Therapeutics, and Company, and others are evaluating their candidates in different stages of clinical development. They aim to investigate their products for the treatment of syndromic and monogenic obesity. The market for syndromic and monogenic obesity therapeutics is still in its nascent stages but is expected to grow due to increasing awareness, advancements in genetic screening, and regulatory incentives for orphan diseases.\n\nHowever, challenges remain, including the high cost of therapies, limited patient identification, and the need for long-term efficacy data. As precision medicine gains traction, the development of gene-editing and RNA-based therapies could further expand the treatment landscape, potentially transforming the standard of care for these rare but severe obesity disorders.\n\nExplore in-depth for a comprehensive understanding of the Syndromic and Monogenic Obesity Clinical Trials\n\nAbout DelveInsight\n\nDelveInsight is a leading Business Consultant and Market Research firm focused exclusively on life sciences.

            "content": "Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (LLY) has been raking it in lately thanks to its two flagship products: Mounjaro and Zepbound. These two have brought in staggering amounts of cash, but what will Lilly be doing with all that money? It has plans, and investors are reasonably pleased, with shares up fractionally in Thursday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nEli Lilly now plans, reports note, to put that massive weight loss windfall to use on several major diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, ALS, and \u201cchronic pain.\u201d It already may have an Alzheimer\u2019s preventative drug in play with Kisunla, and is putting its windfall to work on several other fronts.\n\nThese are the huge problems, and indeed, they are sitting right in plain sight. But the problem is, reports note, that they are big problems and as such might not be solved for several years. Given that Eli Lilly is flush with cash, though, it can afford a payback period that stretches into years, and is still uncertain at best.\n\nKeeping the Cash Flowing\n\nBut Lilly knows that, in order to pursue these far-off and somewhat amorphous goals of future cures, it will need to be backstopped by plenty of cash. Thus it, along with Merck (MRK), got together to create the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium.\n\nThe consortium in question will work to develop new ways to produce pharmaceuticals, which will hopefully help meet rising demand for several types of drugs. That development has been hotly anticipated thanks in part to the rise of compounding pharmacies, which have been able to produce a kind of generic weight-loss drug to fill the gap between supply and demand that Eli Lilly has had a much harder time filling.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on LLY stock based on 16 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After an 17.45% rally in its share price over the past year, the average LLY price target of $1,016 per share implies 16.2% upside potential.\n\nSee more LLY analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Goodes Prize to Daniel M. Skovronsky, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Lilly, and President, Lilly Research Labs, at the Inaugural ADDF Scientific Summit on Wednesday, March 5th. Skovronsky will be recognized for his groundbreaking work to develop critical diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's in addition to his leadership in developing and commercializing Kisunla, one of the first disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's patients.\n\nDaniel M. Skovronsky, MD, PhD, of Eli Lilly & Company, announced as the 2025 Melvin R. Goodes Prize\n\nThe game-changing diagnostics developed with Skovronsky's help include the Amyvid PET scan, the first FDA-approved diagnostic test for Alzheimer's; the Tauvid PET scan, the first and only FDA-approved diagnostic for Tau in the brain; and a blood biomarker test for p-tau217 for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The Goodes Prize, referred to as the Nobel Prize of Alzheimer's research, is presented annually to a leading scientist to mark exceptional contributions to the Alzheimer's field. This international award was established by the late Melvin R. Goodes to advance critical science aimed at fighting Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.\n\n\"Dan is the epitome of a Goodes Prize awardee, a leading scientist who has advanced innovative and bold ideas to transform how we diagnose and develop new treatments for Alzheimer's,\" said Howard Fillit, MD, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer at the ADDF. \"The Goodes Prize emphasizes our ongoing commitment to accelerating drug development for Alzheimer's and honors the legacy of Mel Goodes, a trailblazer in the pharmaceutical industry. We are thrilled to recognize Dan's outstanding work and partnership with the ADDF, which spans more than 20 years. His efforts to develop the Amyvid PET scan made recent Alzheimer's drug approvals possible, including Lilly's Kisunla, and will benefit patients now and for years to come.\"\n\nThe Amyvid PET scan, which received early seed funding from the ADDF, is a brain imaging test that helps detect Alzheimer's disease by combining a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and an injection of Amyvid, a radioactive tracer. Amyvid was instrumental in the approval of the first disease-modifying Alzheimer's drugs \u2013 Aduhelm in 2021, Leqembi in 2023, and Kisunla in 2024 \u2013 providing the biomarker data needed for regulatory approval.\n\n\"Over the past decade, we have witnessed remarkable advances in Alzheimer's research,\" said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer, Lilly, and President, Lilly Research Labs. \"It is my belief that through early detection and early intervention we can someday make Alzheimer's a preventable disease. I am deeply honored to receive the prestigious Goodes Prize award and look forward to joining fellow recipients who are leading the way in developing new treatments for Alzheimer's. The early support from the ADDF for my work, which aimed to revolutionize how we diagnose patients to ensure the right ones were included in our studies, was crucial to advancing the field, and I will always be grateful for that support.\"\n\nThe Goodes Prize, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year in Stockholm with a program featuring Queen Silvia of Sweden and U.S. Ambassador to Sweden Erik Ramanathan, honors scientists who are leading new approaches to developing Alzheimer's therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\n\"To have pioneering scientists like Dan who have received this award out there in the field, pushing research forward, is truly a gift,\" said Nancy Goodes, ADDF Board Member. \"The breakthroughs being made in the name of the Goodes Prize are the most meaningful legacy for my husband.\"\n\nThe 11th annual Goodes Prize will be presented at 6:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 5, 2025 during the inaugural ADDF Scientific Summit. This celebration of Alzheimer's science will be hosted by Dr. Howard Fillit and features a keynote address from Dr. Sanjay Gupta, MD, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, bestselling author and practicing neurosurgeon. The summit will highlight nine world-renowned scientists and recipients of the Melvin R. Goodes Prize discussing therapeutics, biomarkers, prevention, and what is coming next in the field. Skovronsky will be the latest to join the ranks of these accomplished scientists who have helped bring the biology of aging to the forefront of Alzheimer's research.\n\n\"The Goodes Prize represents our mission to treat, prevent, and ultimately cure Alzheimer's disease,\" commented Mark Roithmayr, ADDF Chief Executive Officer. \"We support one of the largest and most diverse clinical development portfolios for Alzheimer's disease, and pioneering research, like Dan's, is critical to our goal of driving meaningful innovation and change in drug development.\"\n\nThe Melvin R. Goodes Prize for Excellence in Drug Development was established in 2015 in honor of Melvin R. Goodes, former CEO of Warner-Lambert Company, who channeled his unique knowledge of the drug industry into Alzheimer's advocacy after being diagnosed with the disease. The award recognizes individual researchers whose work has significantly advanced our understanding of Alzheimer's, paving the way for potential breakthroughs in treatment and prevention. Previous Goodes Prize recipients have demonstrated tremendous innovation and perseverance in the quest for effective treatment options for Alzheimer's. Internationally lauded as the highest recognition in Alzheimer's research, the Goodes Prize has helped move the field forward by facilitating thought provoking discussions among leading scientists from academia, industry, and philanthropy in pursuit of a future free of Alzheimer's.\n\nAbout The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF)\n\nFounded in 1998 by Leonard A. and Ronald S.

It\u2019s not certain if that was due to the weight loss, but a recent observational study linked GLP-1 drugs to an increased rate of kidney stones.\n\nA third patient, whose weight plunged 31% over a similar span, has been constantly making himself eat calorie-dense foods like peanut butter to avoid losing more. \u201cI go to my visits and they\u2019re like, \u2018make sure you eat as much as you can,\u2019\u201d he said.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Bill Barker. Bill, good to see you. Thanks for being here.\n\nBill Barker: Thanks for having me.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I want to get back to this DeepSeek story because this one trillion-dollar market crash seems to be not really talked about anymore. Fewer than two weeks ago, the market panicked when this large language model that was released by a Chinese hedge fund went into the open world. The company claimed that it has trained its model for less than six million dollars, and this revelation created basically a one trillion dollar market wipeout, hitting companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and NVIDIA. Now we're a little under two weeks away. I think it's time to do a retrospective and look back on this. Bill, was this an overreaction, an underreaction, or did we find the porridge just right on this reaction?\n\nBill Barker: Well, I think it was a large reaction fueled by not enough information and too many people trading as if they understood the story in the moment, which was impossible given the parts of the story that were left out and the inadequacy and unpreparedness for most people to take in the details of what is going on in AI models. I think that there are parts of the story which entirely deserved a large and significant stock reaction, and parts which did not. We're two weeks away, and those things have sorted each other out far better than they did in the moment, but I don't think that we're exactly finished with this story.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I think one of my favorite reactions was from OpenAI, who was upset that possibly DeepSeek used some of its technology to train its model, and they didn't do it with OpenAI's permission. They were very upset about that. But the news today is that lawmakers are looking to ban DeepSeek on government devices under the appropriately titled No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act. You're also seeing corporations, not just the United States, but across the world concerned about having this application on their employees' phones. One cybersecurity firm, Armis said that roughly 70% of its corporate clients requested blocks. I think what we're going to see is, A, the technology seems to be catching up, and the costs seem to be going down. But as you mentioned, this story is developing really rapidly, and investors seem to be reacting as if they know when they don't have all the information. Taking all this into consideration, how do you think investors can prepare for what I would describe a more violent market with stories that seem to be quickly moved on from?\n\nBill Barker: Well, you can always be better prepared from the risk of volatility by being more disciplined in having holdings across many sectors and being more diversified. If everything you own is AI or proximate to it, then you're going to enjoy increased volatility going forward. But I think the story that there was potential massive improvements on OpenAI's work through just tweaking some of the algorithms or not tweaking, a lot of work goes into these things, and that there are efficiencies out there that were not in any way being pursued and now they will be pursued is a big part of the story that DeepSeek used openAI's work seems to be the most obvious thing possible to start with looking into.\n\nI also think that the government and corporate reaction to, we don't need DeepSeek immediately today, there are any number of AI programs from non-Chinese entities that we can use on our computers, on our phones, why don't we do that until we know more, and I think that the reaction is in part fueled by how impossible it is to do things later as exemplified by TikTok, which has too many passionate users to effectively shut down without massive disruptions to many voters, really. If DeepSeek were allowed to be as entrenched in people's lives as TikTok, when perhaps it doesn't need in the short term to be, why not just act out of abundance of caution both as a government and as a corporate entity and keep it off the systems today, and when it's proven that it's safe, come back to it?\n\nRicky Mulvey: Nip it in the bud early. Let's get into some earnings coverage. Hershey reported this morning big headlines, Bill. Americans still like chocolate and salty snacks. Hershey reported that sales are up 9% on a constant currency basis, net income more than doubled. This was a little bit of a surprise for me because, Bill, I thought healthier eating and weight loss drugs were going to sink demand for Hershey. What's happening here?\n\nBill Barker: Welcome to America, I suppose. I don't think that healthy eating is going to be something that ever in our lifetimes, replaces eating for taste and enjoyment. It may supplement it, it may make some inroads, and GLP-1 drugs have certainly impacted what the future of this company looks to be. But at the moment, people are eating about the same amount of chocolate as last year. A little bit better. They've had some acquisitions that fueled some of that 9% top line increase that you're talking about on the revenue side. Also a little bit of inflation. You subtract those things, the growth is pretty modest as one would expect it to be with a mature company like this that really has very little inroads in the international markets. Hershey's is almost entirely an American story. Europeans turn their noses up at Hershey's chocolate. It's really impacted going forward by the cost of cocoa and sugar, which are extremely impactful, as one might imagine to chocolate.\n\nRicky Mulvey: The new information was the popularity of salty snacks, things like Dot's pretzels. This is actually one where not even tongue in cheek, I would have expected a larger pullback given the interest in healthier eating and weight loss drugs. Chocolate's more of the treat. These are the hyperpalatable foods that a lot of these weight loss drugs are alleviating the cravings for. Yet, Hershey grew sales of North American salty snacks by more than a third, 36%. I was wrong. What did Hershey get right here?\n\nBill Barker: A little bit of market share. These are some companies that Hershey acquired, not major brands in the salty snack space and Hershey's distribution has improved sales there, so it's good diversification. Acquisition for Hershey's is the owner now of the Pirate Snacks, Pirate Booty, if you've got kids that love that stuff. It's not all chocolate, despite the name, and the salty snacks had a better year and their availability to grow market share, given Hershey's many distribution channels. But still, as you can see from the guidance for next year, it's going to be the cocoa and sugar. Chocolate is going to be the biggest driver of the bottom line for this company.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I know you also like to talk about Hershey's unique ownership structure, because it's unlike a lot of other companies. How is the ownership structure of Hershey set up? Why is it interesting to you?\n\nBill Barker: Well, it's a great story. Milton Hershey passed away about 100 years ago, didn't have children, and gave his fortune, really, to establish a school, the Milton Nursery School. At the time, it was for orphan boys, I think, and over the years, it's expanded beyond that. But this is basically they've held onto the stock for 100 years, and as you can imagine, the compounding on that's pretty good. The endowment for this school, 2,000 students out in Central Pennsylvania around Hershey has got an endowment that I think 14 or 15 billion would place it in terms of US universities in or near the top 10, I think, right between University of Michigan and Duke. It's got more money than Duke, which for those that don't like Duke probably comes as good news. But other than that, it points to the ownership, and that's the majority of the voting stock is controlled by the school. It just has very different priorities than maximizing profits. It's got the legacy of Milton Hershey to look through, and in terms of, for instance, it's turning down the offer from Mondelez at the end of last year.\n\nMaybe the concept of Hershey being owned by somebody other than the entities in and around Hershey PA just don't jibe with the trust understanding of its ownership responsibilities. But I definitely think that if you're investing alongside the Milton Nursery School, Milton Nursery Trust, which oversees this, you're investing alongside a voting entity which has priorities which are not strictly capitalism.\n\nRicky Mulvey: That's the long-term look. Anything else from the quarter, the failed Mondelez deal, junk food trends you want to hit with Hershey before we move on?\n\nBill Barker: I think it's not a stock that's going to have major moves in my estimation unless it opens itself up to being acquired, but it'll continue to pay a great dividend. The school will benefit from what Milton Hershey did 100 years ago, but it's not terribly exciting as an investment beyond that.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Let's talk about a company that was founded in 1876 that, Bill, is looking a lot like a growth stock. Eli Lilly reported this morning. I want to talk about their revenue growth number, and I'm going to put it in some context of some younger growth stocks. These are the yearly revenue growth numbers of a few companies, Toast, which does the payment platform for restaurants that you've seen when you get a few questions when you pick up a cup of coffee. It's 26% year over year revenue growth. The hottest band in the world was Kiss. The hottest stock on the market is Palantir, 36% year over year revenue growth up by more than a third. That's good. AI is catching on. Eli Lilly with the weight loss drugs, revenue growth up 45% year over year, and then the one that's beating it is my beloved Rocket Lab at about 55%. Bill, when you see this 19th century pharmaceutical company in the context of these younger, hungrier growth companies, what do you think when you see lights out numbers like that?\n\nBill Barker: I see a number of things. One is that it's been a phenomenal year for Lilly, and that the growth that you're pointing to is very much being enjoyed in the moment. 2024, a couple of expansions of the GLP-1 drugs into the market, phenomenal. You go back the previous couple of years and Lilly was not growing at the pace that it grew in 2024, and 2025 is looking to be a very good year too. You can make pretty good educated guesses about drug sales based on what's in the market and when the patents roll off and all that. It's a great moment for Lilly, and the moment was created by decades of work. I don't want to imply that it's short-term in some way. But I don't think that this year's revenue growth is the only number that you should look at to identify what the longer term growth is likely to be.\n\nRicky Mulvey: It's getting more profitable. Net income is up more than 100%. What are the numbers I should be looking at then, Bill?\n\nBill Barker: Well, as I say, you want to look at the trailing couple of years and the fact that, for instance, net income doubled this year, total net income, I think, came in around $11.7 billion up from $5.7 billion in 2023, that's great. The income was above seven billion in 2020, 2021, 2022. 2023 was an off year for the total net income. This year, it's incorporating all of that built up R&D that came out on the market. That is going to flow into next year as well. I just would caution against thinking this is despite the fact that it's trading at a P/E of 90, 95 right now, something like that. That implies the growth that the company has enjoyed this year and is slated to next year, that given the nature of blockbuster drugs which don't come on a regular cadence every year, to just keep that part in mind.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I appreciate you zooming out. In the blockbuster drugs that investors are excited for, one is a weight loss pill, not an injection. In a mid-stage trial, helped patients lose about 15% of their weight. They also have a next-gen weight loss drug that has helped patients lose more than 24% of their weight. These are mid-stage trials not approved by the FDA. But I'm looking at these blockbuster drugs. I think they're going to be massive. I think the more people see people they know getting dramatic results on weight loss drugs, the more that people are going to take them. I own some Eli Lilly. It's not a big position because this is not well within my circle of competence, but you've mentioned caution. Bill, what could wreck my thesis in this as I look to the years ahead?\n\nBill Barker: Of course, somebody else doing the same thing other than Eli Lilly, if not a wreck of the thesis, it would be impacting on it dramatically. Nordisk is pursuing the same weight loss pill, and that will be, I agree, a big chunk of money for somebody and probably more than one company. There'll probably be some competing versions that have slightly different side effect characteristics and slightly different efficacies. You can look at those two as being the most likely to hit that jackpot. Some of that jackpot is being priced into Lilly today, and it'll either get as much or more of that jackpot as it's being priced in or less of it. It could just be as simple as that, as simple as the failure of the next stage of the clinical trial to be successful, regulatory, slowdown. There are a lot of things for a company that is doing great work and reaping the benefits of it and is trading at a P/E of 90.\n\nIt could be trading, why not, at 60. That's still a big reward for a drug company. If it were trading at 60, you wouldn't say, well, market just doesn't believe in this company. [laughs] It believes in it a whole lot today and with good reason. But it doesn't take a lot to take 20% off of that level of optimism.\n\nRicky Mulvey: We'll see if we can tie it together. A few themes from this discussion today is that junk food continues to be popular, interest in weight loss drugs continues to soar. We thought these would come at the expense of each other, a lot on Wall Street did. But any broader investing lessons from this as we look at the earnings from both Hershey and Eli Lilly.\n\nBill Barker: Well, certainly, if chocolate, solid snacks and the drug companies could all get together in a room and come up with the way where you can just take the drugs and maintain a huge appetite for snacks, certainly the snack companies would be all in on that, and the problem for them with GLP-1 is the reduction of the appetite for those snacks rather than the ability to just eat whatever you want and keep the weight off. Whoever comes up with that drug, I think, is going to be celebrated by Hershey and Mondelez and others, and may or may not be the big winner.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I think you've got a biotech business brewing. Bill Barker, appreciate you being here. Thanks for your time and insight.\n\nBill Barker: Thanks for having me.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Up next, what it's like getting stuff made in Hollywood right now? You may have heard Jordan Harper on the show yesterday discussing black bag public relations and how it impacts the news you read and watch. But he's also worked in Hollywood for years, producing and writing for shows including Gotham and The Mentalist. Harper has had a front row seat through the transition from broadcast television to streaming. He joined me to talk about what streaming executives really want in new shows, how it impacts what you watch, and why it's fundamentally different from commercial TV. For a lot of viewers right now, television viewers, it doesn't seem like things have changed that much from a few years ago. I'm watching stuff on streaming. There's still new television shows coming out, there's still movies coming out. You hear about a dip, but it's not immediately apparent, I think, for a lot of just regular consumers and viewers of television. You've been on the inside for a while. For the viewing audience at home, those who aren't in Hollywood, what have you noticed about what's different trying to get TV made in 2025 versus 2018-2019?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, I think we're seeing the end game of trends that started a little earlier than that. Streaming is not a friendly medium for art, and that's what we're learning, and everybody's going to immediately come up with counter examples to that, and there are counter examples to that. But the actual golden age of television that we refer to actually died around the same time that streaming was born. Shows like The Sopranos and Mad Men and Breaking Bad all went off the air right as Netflix started making television. They rode the wave of being connected to these shows that they had no real relationship to. But what's changing is just the contradictions are heightening. The emphasis that has always existed on making IP, intellectual property stuff based on movies, based on books, that is growing. The episode orders are getting shorter. It takes longer to make.\n\nWe're reaching this strange place where in very essential ways, television is not being made to be watched any longer. I'll explain that, because the whole gig started with television with commercials. It was in the interest of the people who made money off television to make people actually watch it, because we tracked that they watched it, and ad sales were based on that. We now live in a subscription world where if you sign up for a subscription and never watch the channel once, or you watch it in the background while you're cleaning your toes or whatever you do, they make the same amount of money. I've been explicitly told this by an executive at a streamer who told me in what I would say is a very dispiriting meeting, he said, I don't make TV shows, I make posters. He said, don't come to me with a pitch, come to me with a poster, because what I need is a placard that we can put on a person's TV screen that has a photo of a famous person and a TV show idea that they can grasp by looking at it. He specifically used Denzel as an example. He said if we've got Denzel in the show, maybe it's as good as training day, maybe it's as bad as virtuosity.\n\nBut it doesn't matter because they already signed up and they paid the $10 a month. I said, well, but if they don't watch it, won't they unsubscribe? He's like, do you? That's the world that we're living in, and it is an incredibly unfriendly environment for people who are trying to make good art that is also entertaining. It's incredibly unfriendly, and that unfriendliness is more visible now than it was before. They're anti-art stance. Again, art doesn't have to stand in opposition to entertainment. There's been amazing TV that has been made all the way from the Twilight Zone, through Twin Peaks, through NYPD Blue, through The Sopranos, and The Shield, and all of those great shows. There have been great shows on streaming as well. But it's not the same. I think it is frankly ultra-processed, if I can do a callback, and our position from coming out of the strike as writers is that we're in an environment that feels frankly antagonistic.\n\nRicky Mulvey: I was watching one of your episodes of The Mentalists last night to prepare for this conversation. One of the things I noticed from network TV, is I'm sure there was an ask of writers to reset the audience. If you have a character relationship, they need to know if this is someone's dad, if this is someone's boss, where do these characters stand in relation to each other. In some ways, they are explaining their position. You also see writers criticizing Netflix for saying Netflix executives want characters to explain what they're doing. What's different about now versus what was asked of network television in that?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, I think that's a pretty valid point, and I would say that, yes, The Mentalist, which I'm very grateful to for teaching me a lot about storytelling, was a network procedural that was aimed in a lowest common denominator way. We would get those notes. Can we lay into the dialogue how long this couple's been married? Can we lay into the dialogue that this is that? Those notes could be frustrating for us as well. What I would say is those notes were put there oftentimes because of commercial breaks, which are involuntary gaps in the show that are put there by the network in order to make money. But what is being described now is literally you have to prep your audience for them to not consume the product at all, not taking a break during a commercial break, but to encourage actively doing something else while watching the TV show. That's a very hard note to take.\n\nI'll also say, just to close off, that we did complain about those notes. I think that I had a trick on The Mentalist where if an executive asked me to do something like that, I would very often write it in the script in Jane, that's Simon Baker's character, the main character, because I knew Simon didn't like to deliver that pointless dialogue and oftentimes would ask if we could cut the line. I would build it in a way to cut as much of that dialogue as I could just to escape those notes. But I do think there is something different and darker about these notes today.\n\nRicky Mulvey: To be clear, I wasn't trying to be got you with it that I watched. I was grateful for the note as someone who hadn't maybe not grateful for the note. I appreciated it as someone who was watching a random episode in Season 2, Season 3, and not someone who had watched the series in its entirety. There's immense amount of cynicism. You do have a movie that's getting made right now in She Rides Shotgun based off your book. I guess, generally, how are you trying to sell stuff in Hollywood right now then given this cynical and antagonistic landscape?\n\nJordan Harper: Well, if you notice several times at the beginning of this conversation, I referred to my Hollywood career as being in the past. It is not, but I am looking at other past. I find that features are a better place, movies are more creative. They always have been, but there was a brief time when we thought that TV could rise up to what film can do. I think we're learning that that's really not the case. There's great TV, but film is a more exciting art form, I think, and it's more wide open. There are independent films still being made. She Rides Shotgun is an independent feature. I'm exploring that. I actually just sold a movie pitch, I'm going to start writing a screenplay soon. Then I'm working on my books, because I do think that my friends who are just authors complain about the corporate structures of publishing, and I try and tell them you have no idea this is the promised land. I do try to remove myself from television if I can. But it's what I've done for 15 years, so I'm sure when the mortgage comes calling, I will definitely come back at some point. But I'm trying to remove myself.\n\nRicky Mulvey: Jordan Harper, thank you so much for your time, your insight, and your wonderful books. I've had a great time reading them. I can already recommend The Last King of California. I'm 50 pages into it, been ripping through. Thanks for coming on Motley Fool Money.

Fears of heightened oversight in the industry could weigh on not just Eli Lilly, but healthcare stocks as a whole.

Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nHas Eli Lilly's stock indeed peaked, and could this be the start of a much broader sell-off, or is now a potentially good time to add the healthcare giant to your portfolio?\n\nWhy Eli Lilly investors should remain bullish\n\nThere's been growing concern in the healthcare industry of late as investors worry about whether the new government may put in more restrictive measures on GLP-1 drugs and whether there will be greater scrutiny around vaccines.\n\nFor investors, however, the focus should always be on the long term. Government policies and regulations are uncontrollable and the good news is that for a business such as Eli Lilly, which is developing potentially life-changing treatments for patients, it's in a great position to grow its sales and profits for years to come.\n\nIn Eli Lilly's most recent quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, 2024, it grew its sales by 20% to $11.4 billion. It also had multiple products that generated over $1 billion in revenue, including its top GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro ($3.1 billion) and Zepbound ($1.3 billion). Late last year, regulators approved Zepbound as a treatment option for adults with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It's a significant development as that could lead to more prescriptions and prove to be a catalyst for more revenue growth for the business in the near future.\n\nWith Eli Lilly posting strong financials and its top GLP-1 drugs still in their early growth stages, there are plenty of reasons to remain bullish on the stock when looking at it over the long haul.\n\nHow big of a problem is Eli Lilly's valuation?\n\nThe biggest concern with Eli Lilly stock may come back to its valuation. Investors have been paying a premium for the business due to its fantastic growth prospects in the anti-obesity market. But a multiple of 86 times its trailing earnings could be a tough valuation to justify for investors right now.\n\nThe good news is that when you factor in future earnings, the price may not be as steep. Based on analyst expectations, Eli Lilly is trading at 35 times next year's profits. While that may still seem high, it does suggest that given a high level of growth, its valuation should become more tenable in the future.\n\nAnd when you're looking even further ahead, at the next five years, the valuation may be even more justifiable as Eli Lilly stock trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) multiple of around 0.75. Anything below a PEG of 1 is generally considered a good deal. Based on its longer-term valuation metrics, I'd argue that Eli Lilly may not be that expensive.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Eli Lilly stock?\n\nEli Lilly still looks poised to hit the $1 trillion market cap in the future, and I think it's just a matter of when rather than if it will happen. And that's why it can still make for a good buy today. Its attractive opportunities in the GLP-1 drug market make it one of the better growth stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nInvestors shouldn't worry too much about government policies and regulations as they aren't likely to weigh down the business in the long run. There is always going to be a need for advancements in healthcare and for companies to develop new drugs, and Eli Lilly has proven to be a leader on both fronts, which is why it can be one of the safer long-term investments to hang on to.\n\nIf you can get the stock at any kind of a discount, you shouldn't hesitate to take it. I think Eli Lilly's valuation can rise a whole lot higher. While it may be down in recent months, that doesn't mean it has peaked; the stock still has a lot of upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nManufacturing investments have taken center stage in recent years \u2014 from some pharma giants ramping up GLP-1 manufacturing capacity to meet soaring demand to other companies focusing on advanced capabilities that could ensure an adequate supply of vaccines.\n\nWith the spotlight on the industry\u2019s need to increase capacity and make manufacturing more efficient, Eli Lilly and Merck & Co. have partnered with Purdue University to launch the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, which will research and develop new production technologies.\n\nElizabeth Topp, director, Young Institute Purdue University photo/Rebecca Robinos\n\n\u201cThe consortium brings together companies invested in pharmaceutical manufacturing, with the goal of spanning the value chain: Big Pharma, startups, equipment manufacturers, instrument manufacturers, packaging companies, and venture capital, to name a few. Our initial focus will be on drug product manufacturing,\u201d Elizabeth Topp, director of the Young Institute, said via email.\n\nThe collaboration also \u201cunderscores a commitment to onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing while bolstering domestic production,\u201d said a press release announcing the consortium. That could be especially important as new tariffs threaten to raise costs and exacerbate shortages.\n\nLilly has already put its money where its mouth is in that regard, saying it will spend $3 billion to expand a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin it bought in April and add new capabilities to produce injectable medicines. It also recently invested $9 billion in an Indiana manufacturing site and opened a new facility in North Carolina.\n\nAt the new Young Institute, companies will focus on experimentation.\n\n\u201cWe hope that innovations from our consortium will make it into \u2018real\u2019 manufacturing facilities, though,\u201d Topp said.\n\nOne major focus of the consortium will be improving aseptic processing technology, a key component of injectable drug manufacturing, through advances including AI, robotics and in-process sensors.\n\n\u201cAseptic processing maintains a sterile, microorganism-free environment during manufacturing without using heat sterilization. It's particularly important for injectable liquid products, where sterility is an absolute requirement but where the drug could be damaged by heating,\u201d Topp said. \u201cThese \u2018sterile injectables\u2019 include life-saving medicines like insulin and vaccines, and constitute most of the drug shortages in the U.S.\u201d\n\nHere, Topp explains more about the consortium\u2019s potential impact on the industry.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and style.\n\nPHARMAVOICE: Let\u2019s talk about how the consortium will leverage its manufacturing footprint. Will it include joint facilities and cost sharing?\n\nELIZABETH TOPP: Yes, joint manufacturing facilities will be involved. We're working on renovating space at Purdue that will be a testing ground for new manufacturing technologies. It won't be operated under full regulatory approval (under GMP conditions), so we won't actually be making any drug products. We're very keen to have companies of all kinds join our consortium \u2014 proposals for joining by cost share, in the form of equipment donations or donations of computational resources, are welcome.\n\nHow will these efforts eventually benefit the broader pharma industry?\n\nMember companies and the industry as a whole will benefit in several important ways. For example, our members will have the opportunity to develop new manufacturing technologies, and to drive the focus areas of the consortium's research efforts toward the critical pain points for the industry. Those efforts will involve collaboration with Purdue's outstanding faculty, which is rich in science and engineering talent in a strongly entrepreneurial environment.\n\nIn addition, members will be able to speak collectively to regulatory agencies, in the form of best practices papers and consensus standards for new manufacturing technologies, with greater impact than individual companies speaking alone. Our members will also develop a direct connection with a great talent pipeline in the form of Purdue students and will have the opportunity to help shape the type of education and training they receive.\n\nWhat will participation look like for companies in the consortium?\n\nWe have three membership tiers with a range of financial commitment and influence. The tiers have been designed to encourage participation by the full value chain, from multinational pharmaceutical companies to startups and academic institutions.\n\nWill the consortium have an impact on the broader industry goal of onshoring more pharma manufacturing?\n\nIt's a great question and we certainly don't have all the answers. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is global, with many key raw materials and drug compounds being produced in countries like India and China. Because it's less expensive to manufacture in those countries than in the U.S., offshoring has helped control overall manufacturing costs. Imposing tariffs may decrease the offshore advantage, but with the risk of greater overall costs, costs that will probably be passed on to consumers.\n\nThere is also considerable interest in onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing to ensure that there's an adequate supply of critical medicines during pandemics or global conflicts. We hope that our initiatives to improve pharmaceutical manufacturing technology will help make onshoring achievable, and lessen the impact of tariffs, by improving efficiency, throughput, and supply chain management.",

            "content": "Not all growth stocks worth buying these days focus on the artificial intelligence field. There are many exciting ones in other industries -- even in healthcare, a sector some investors might consider boring. Two healthcare stocks that may or may not be boring, but that regardless look like strong growth stocks to invest in this month, are Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT).\n\nThe case for Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly has been a terrific stock to own for the past five years, thanks to its excellent clinical and regulatory progress. The company's breakthroughs are paying off. In each of the past six quarters, Eli Lilly's revenues have increased by more than 20% year over year, which is an incredible result for a pharmaceutical giant.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nLLY Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\n\n\nLLY Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nEli Lilly should continue to grow its top line faster than its similarly sized peers. Its lineup features several blockbusters, including its popular diabetes and weight loss medicines, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nIt's true that these drugs' sales are not increasing quite as fast as analysts expected, which has led to the stock declining over the past five months. However, that dip has created a better entry point for long-term investors.\n\nThe company won't stop innovating. It boasts exciting candidates across all clinical trial stages. Eli Lilly's investigational gene therapy for deafness is in early-stage studies and is already showing promise. Last year, the company reported that after treatment with the gene therapy, an 11-year-old patient who had been deaf from birth was able to hear for the first time. Eli Lilly's late-stage pipeline features such products as retatrutide, a potential novel weight loss treatment.\n\nEli Lilly broke new ground with Zepbound. It's a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist, meaning it mimics the action of those two hormones. It was the first treatment of its kind to earn the green light from health regulators. Retatrutide mimics the action of three hormones: GLP-1, GIP, and GCG. Eli Lilly nicknamed this investigational weight loss therapy \"Triple G.\" These examples barely scratch the surface of Eli Lilly's pipeline. Investors can expect significant R&D progress from the company in the next five years and strong financial results.\n\nLastly, Eli Lilly is an excellent dividend growth stock. Management has increased its payouts by a total of almost 103% in the past five years. So both for its growth prospects and its quality as an income investment, Eli Lilly looks like an excellent pick now, especially since its share price performance hasn't been strong recently.\n\n2. Sarepta Therapeutics\n\nSarepta Therapeutics is a biotech that specializes in developing drugs for rare diseases where current treatment options are limited. The company has several drugs on the market that treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a progressive genetic disease that weakens patients' muscles.\n\nThe most important therapy in Sarepta Therapeutics' portfolio is Elevidys, which last year earned full FDA approval for use in ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. The medicine also earned accelerated approval for non-ambulatory patients, so additional trials may be required for it to maintain its approval in that demographic.\n\nIn the meantime, Elevidys is giving a significant boost to Sarepta Therapeutics' financial results, which is unsurprising since there aren't many safe and effective treatment options for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Elevidys, unlike the biotech's other medicines, targets the disease's underlying causes. Sarepta Therapeutics has announced preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.\n\nThe company expects to report $1.8 billion in net revenue for 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. That would be an increase of about 49%.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics recently announced more positive results from a phase 3 study for Elevidys. The company has many other pipeline candidates, including several more potential Duchenne muscular dystrophy therapies. The biotech is also going after other targets.\n\nIt is currently running a phase 3 trial for an investigational therapy for Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy. Sarepta Therapeutics has more than 40 candidates in its pipeline.\n\nBetween those programs and the company's current lineup, which is already driving strong top-line growth, Sarepta Therapeutics could deliver excellent long-term returns.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The Denmark-based company performed pretty well, leading to a post-earnings jump in its stock price.\n\nThough Novo Nordisk's financial performance was strong, it's worth pointing out several other things management mentioned during its earnings conference call with analysts. Here are two important insights from that call that should excite investors about Novo Nordisk's future.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe runaway leader in the GLP-1 market\n\nNovo Nordisk's work in the GLP-1 space has been instrumental to its success in recent years. The company's famous medicines, diabetes treatment Ozempic and anti-obesity medicine Wegovy, have been on fire.\n\nHowever, some investors are worried that Novo Nordisk will lose significant market share to its longtime rival, Eli Lilly, in the GLP-1 market. Eli Lilly developed its own GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which target diabetes and obesity, respectively. In one head-to-head study, Zepbound even proved superior to Wegovy in helping patients shed excess weight.\n\nDespite the challenge from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk remains the runaway leader in this fast-growing space. As Novo Nordisk's CFO, Karsten Munk Knudsen, said during the earnings call:\n\nWe are serving almost two-thirds of the global GLP-1 market and then competition [is] sitting on the remaining one-third. Specifically for the last year, just to have hard data, we have expanded patient reach ... more in absolute numbers, more than any other competitor in this market.\n\nNovo Nordisk's continued dominance in this field is why its financial results remain impressive. In 2024, the company's revenue grew by 25% year over year to 290.4 billion Danish kroner ($40.4 billion). Ozempic's sales came in at 120.3 billion DKK ($16.8 billion), 26% higher than in 2023. Wegovy's revenue jumped by 86% year over year to 58.2 billion DKK ($8.1 billion).\n\nIt's no wonder Novo Nordisk's shares jumped following the release of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report.\n\nKey clinical milestones on the way\n\nEven though Novo Nordisk is still leading the GLP-1 market, competition will become stronger in this space in the coming years. Many drugmakers are looking to dip their toes into this therapeutic area, as are many smaller biotech companies. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its GLP-1 products; in 2024, Ozempic and Wegovy made up 61.5% of Novo Nordisk's total sales.\n\nBut the company also has a GLP-1 pipeline that's just as strong as that of any of its peers, if not stronger. Says Novo Nordisk's Martin Holst Lange, executive VP and head of clinical development:\n\nWe expect the first phase 3 results from CagriSema [in type 2 diabetes], as well as phase 2 results for both subcutaneous ... amycretin and [a] once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 co-agonist. Moving to obesity and the first half of '25, we are now expecting to submit ... semaglutide (25 milligrams) for people with obesity to the U.S. regulatory authorities in the first quarter.\n\nSo, Novo Nordisk has several investigational GLP-1 products across diabetes and obesity that will produce clinical trial results this year. Some of them have already produced promising data in other studies. CagriSema delivered a mean weight loss of 22.7% in a 68-week phase 3 study; even though that was short of the 25% mean weight loss that management was targeting, it beat Wegovy in the trial. A subcutaneous version of amycretin also performed well in a phase 1b/2a study.\n\nNovo Nordisk seems to have a GLP-1 medicine development engine that grants it an edge against almost any other pharmaceutical company. It's a pioneer in this field and can lean on many successes -- and failures -- to continue pumping out promising products in this area. So, despite mounting competition, the Denmark-based drugmaker should remain a leader in GLP-1 drugs.\n\nWhy Novo Nordisk is a strong buy\n\nNovo Nordisk has been looking to diversify its lineup in recent years, and is developing medicines in other fields. The company recently reported positive phase 3 results for Mim8 in patients with hemophilia. It has products across several other fields: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and more.\n\nIts rich pipeline, a lineup that's still driving solid top-line growth, and long track record of innovation make Novo Nordisk a stock worth buying and holding onto for a while.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Drug Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.\n\nA survey by Deloitte showed that drug pricing and access are the top concerns among executives in 2025. The survey also showed that the primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. Due to this trend, executives anticipate an increase in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nWe discussed the future of the healthcare industry in the US in a recently published article on the 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cAccording to McKinsey, the healthcare industry is expected to continually undergo a shift in growth dynamics. Health services and technology (HST) revenue pools are anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, supported by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics. The sales of innovative technologies such as generative AI to payers and providers are further supporting this growth. In addition, pharmacy services, especially those focused on specialty pharmacy, are expected to see continued growth. The launch of new therapies and increased utilization are expected to be the primary drivers of this growth. McKinsey estimates specialty pharmacy revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8% between 2023 and 2028, growing EBITDA for managed service providers and specialty pharmacies. Therefore, optimistic trends are materializing for the healthcare industry as a whole, including the medical device sector.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 drug stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) develops, manufactures, discovers, and sells pharmaceutical products. These products span oncology, diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, and other therapies. Investors are bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) due to its in-demand GLP-1 drugs, used to treat diabetes and obesity, which are still in their early growth stages, and the company\u2019s strong financials.\n\nOn February 10, the company announced a collaboration with AdvanCell to advance cancer treatment through targeted alpha therapies. By combining Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) expertise in drug manufacturing with AdvanCell\u2019s Pb-212 production technology and infrastructure, the collaboration aims to expedite clinical progress for innovative radiopharmaceuticals. This is expected to be a significant opportunity for the company to further strengthen its cancer treatment portfolio and explore Pb-212-based therapies.\n\nApart from its partnerships, the company has strong fundamentals. It reported a 32% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, exceeding its first-time guidance by $4 billion. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also made substantial progress across its strategic deliverables in fiscal Q4 2024, with revenue growing by 45% in the quarter, supported by strong uptake of its Mounjaro and Zepbound drugs. Its immunology, oncology, and neuroscience segments are also performing well, supporting bullish sentiments for the stock.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC highlighted LLY in its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) contributed to performance in the fourth quarter. While shares underperformed, our underweight position versus the benchmark resulted in a positive contribution to relative returns. Lilly shares were weak following an uncharacteristic third-quarter earnings miss driven by softer-than-expected sales of its blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs. The company blamed this partly on wholesaler destocking. Lilly reinforced its view that end demand for the drugs remains strong\u201d.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks first on our list of best drug stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Investors should never ignore valuations when picking stocks. The price a stock trades at can drastically impact your overall returns. A metric such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio can be helpful in enabling you to easily gauge how expensive or cheap a stock is.\n\nIn some cases, however, it can make sense to buy a stock that's trading at a seemingly high P/E multiple simply because of its fantastic growth prospects. If you wait for a top growth stock to come down to a P/E of 20 or less, you may end up waiting forever and missing out on the opportunity completely.\n\nBelow, I'll make the case for why pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) still looks like a great buy right now -- even though it trades at a P/E of more than 70 -- and why selling the healthcare stock could be a mistake.\n\nEli Lilly's growth has been accelerating -- and that could continue\n\nFor years, Eli Lilly has been generating solid growth numbers -- but lately, they've been accelerating rapidly. The company is coming off a solid quarter where its revenue rose by 45% for the last three months of 2024:\n\nThe recent surge has been due to the tremendous growth Lilly has achieved due to its highly popular GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). Together, those two products generated $5.4 billion in sales for Eli Lilly last quarter, or 40% of the top line.\n\nDemand has been so strong that shortages of Lilly's GLP-1 drugs have been an issue. The company has been investing billions of dollars into increasing its production capacity at a manufacturing site in Lebanon, Indiana. And as it begins producing medicines there, potentially as early as next year, that could help boost its sales.\n\nA new drug could open up even more growth potential\n\nEli Lilly is still in the early stages of its growth when it comes to GLP-1 treatments. The drugs are game changers for patients, helping them lose weight and become healthier in the process. Currently, Lilly's GLP-1 treatments are injectables.\n\nHowever, by next year, the company may have an even more attractive option for patients: a highly effective oral weight loss drug called orforglipron. By April, the company expects to release late-stage trial data for the drug, which has previously shown that on average, it can help people lose around 15% of their body weight. If the new trial results are strong, they could pave the way for approval by sometime next year.\n\nApproval for orforglipron would not only generate a lot of bullishness for the healthcare stock, but would also provide Eli Lilly with yet another blockbuster drug, and potentially enable it to reach a broader range of patients.\n\nLilly looks poised to hit a $1 trillion market value\n\nShares of Eli Lilly haven't been doing well in recent months, but over the long run, I think they will more than recover. This is a company whose valuation could very well top $1 trillion within the next year or two. Its market capitalization sits around $780 billion now, and reaching that pinnacle would require the stock to rise less than 30% from where it is right now.\n\nLilly's P/E ratio may appear high now. But as the company scales up its operations and its profits rise, that multiple will come down, so I wouldn't be overly concerned with it. Given its robust business and terrific portfolio of drugs, you're likely better off simply buying and holding the stock rather than waiting for the P/E to come down, as doing so could result in missing out on some terrific gains along the way.\n\nAnd while current shareholders may secure a good profit by selling it today, unless they need the money for other reasons, there's no compelling reason to sell -- this is a stock which still has a ton of upside in the long run.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) and Shopify Inc. (SHOP), as well as a micro-cap stock ImmuCell Corp. (ICCC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\n\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, It expects a low double-digit growth rate.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\n\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+14.7% vs. +2.9%). The company\u2019s Q4 earnings beat estimates while sales missed the same. Demand for Lilly\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers.\n\n\n\nIn the past two years, Lilly has received approvals for several new drugs like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\n\nHowever, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Shopify have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+47.1% vs. +28%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in its merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Shopify Balance, Shopify Tax, Shopify Inbox and Tap to Pay solutions are helping it to win new merchants regularly.\n\n\n\nStrong adoption of these solutions holds promise for Shopify\u2019s prospects. Integration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. Expansion of back-office merchant solutions to more countries is also strengthening Shopify\u2019s international footprint.\n\n\n\nAn expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Roblox, PayPal, Snap, Pinterest, Criteo, IBM, Cognizant, Amazon, and Adayen are expected to expand its merchant base further. However, persistent inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)\n\n\n\nImmuCell\u2019s shares have gained +0.8% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry\u2019s gain of +16.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $44.56 million reports 11% year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2024, driven by its market-leading First Defense line targeting the $75-million scours prevention market.\n\n\n\nCapacity expansions support more than $30 million in annual sales, while Re-Tain, nearing FDA approval, aims to disrupt the $2-billion subclinical mastitis market with treatment free of milk/meat restrictions. ATM (at-the-market) offerings increased cash reserves to $3.8 million, aiding growth initiatives. International expansion and market diversification bolster opportunities.\n\n\n\nHowever, Re-Tain\u2019s 20-year, $50-million regulatory delays strain resources, whereas a low gross margin, rising costs and Tri-Shield inefficiencies weigh on profitability. High customer concentration (77% revenues from two clients), shareholder dilution, and competition from giants like Zoetis and Merck pose ongoing risks.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on ImmuCell here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Any miss compared to analyst estimates or underwhelming guidance can quickly lead to a sell-off, analyst downgrades, and a much different outlook for the stock as a whole.\n\nHealthcare giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has been trading at an inflated valuation for some time thanks to excitement around its diabetes and weight loss treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Unfortunately, for shareholders of the company, it failed to meet expectations in its most recent earnings report on Oct. 30. And the numbers weren't even close.\n\nIs the stock in trouble?\n\nEli Lilly's revenue grows by 20%, but falls short of estimates\n\nEli Lilly didn't have a bad quarter, but when perfection is priced into a stock, anything less than glorious results can end up weighing on its valuation. And while the company's revenue rose by 20% to $11.4 billion for the third quarter ending Sept. 30, that fell short of analyst expectations of $12.1 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.18 were also nowhere near the $1.47 EPS Wall Street was looking for.\n\nThe company's numbers would have been better, but a big problem for the drugmaker these days comes back to inventory levels. Demand is strong, but Eli Lilly says as it was fulfilling back orders to wholesalers for Mounjaro and Zepbound, they didn't end up ordering more supply and simply used their existing stock. That could create shortages again next quarter if wholesalers have insufficient supply on hand.\n\nAnother issue for investors is that Eli Lilly adjusted its guidance for the year, now projecting its adjusted EPS to fall within a range of $13.02 and $13.52 (the previous forecast was $16.10 to $16.60). This change reflects acquisition-related charges the company has incurred recently, but the decrease was disappointing for investors.\n\nShould investors be worried?\n\nPrior to earnings, Eli Lilly stock was trading at around $900. As of Monday, the stock was down to around $800, dropping more than 10% of its value in just a few days after the release of its earnings numbers.\n\nAny kind of hiccup can weigh on the healthcare stock, which was previously trading at more than 100 times its trailing profits. It's still not even a terribly cheap buy when you look at its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 36, which is based on analyst expectations of next year's profits. When a stock is trading at such a high premium, expectations are elevated.\n\nThere's some bearishness around Eli Lilly of late, but there's reason to remain optimistic as well. Inventory and supply issues have been a problem for the company for a while, especially with Mounjaro and Zepbound being in such high demand. But over time, those issues should resolve, particularly as the company builds out more capacity; this isn't a problem long-term investors should be concerned about. The same goes for an adjustment to its earnings guidance, which was primarily due to acquisition-related charges -- these are short-term problems.\n\nThere isn't anything to suggest that Eli Lilly is suddenly on the wrong path or that demand for its products is starting to wane, which is why the latest news shouldn't change the outlook for investors.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy?\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, I don't think there's much to worry about with Eli Lilly. The stock is still expensive, but given the long-term potential it has with Mounjaro and Zepbound potentially delivering billions in revenue for years to come, its earnings could catch up to its valuation over time.\n\nI still see Eli Lilly as becoming the first healthcare stock to reach a $1 trillion valuation, so buying it on any kind of weakness can still generate good returns for investors who are willing to buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

As it turns out, Lilly earned $5.32 per share in Q4, and sales were $13.5 billion.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nEli Lilly's Q4 earnings\n\nDriven by strong demand for its Mounjaro and Zepbound GLP-1 drugs, Lilly grew its Q4 sales 45% year over year. But sales of non GLP-1 drugs (which Lilly refers to as \"non-incretin\") weren't too shabby either, growing 20%.\n\nEarnings did even better, more than doubling to $4.88 per share when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). That's not quite as good as \"$5.32,\" which it turns out was a non-GAAP number. But 102% year-over-year growth is still fantastic.\n\nMoreover, Q4's performance indicates growth is still accelerating at Lilly. Full-year sales grew only 32%, to $45 billion, and GAAP earnings per share were up 102% for the year (just like for the quarter) at $11.71.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy?\n\nCEO David Ricks characterized Lilly's 2024 performance as \"highly successful.\" And 2025 should be even better. Lilly sees full-year 2025 sales growing to anywhere from $58 billion to $61 billion, representing sales growth of as much as 35.5%. GAAP earnings should range from $22.05 to $23.55 per share this year, and non-GAAP earnings will be even better.\n\nThat's not 102% annual earnings growth, granted. But at the top of the range, it does imply that Lilly could grow its earnings 101%. And taken at the midpoint of guidance, Lilly appears to be predicting an earnings beat for the coming year. Most analysts are forecasting only $22.69 per-share profit this year.\n\nWith Lilly stock priced at about 37 times current year earnings, and still doubling those earnings every year, there's a strong case to be made that Lilly stock remains a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Large Cap Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other large cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nInvestors continue to favor large-cap stocks, as these companies often serve as the foundation of popular index funds and are well-known among both seasoned professionals and casual traders. Moreover, large-cap firms have demonstrated their ability to withstand economic uncertainty, thanks to their strong market presence and substantial cash reserves, which help them weather financial downturns with relative ease. For the second consecutive year in 2024, US large-cap stocks outpaced cash, bonds, and international equities, securing the top spot in market performance.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA Morningstar report revealed that over the 10-year period ending June 30, 2024, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks by an average of more than 6 percentage points annually. This disparity stems from differences in sector exposure\u2014small-cap benchmarks have a lower concentration of technology stocks and a greater presence in traditional industries like consumer cyclicals, financials, real estate, and industrials. Although economic growth has been robust, these sectors have struggled to match the pace set by technology-related stocks.\n\nIn addition, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management, large-cap stocks play a key role in driving long-term capital appreciation for investors. Over the 10-year period from 2013 to March 2023, large-cap stocks delivered a total return of 162%, outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which posted returns of 139% and 108%, respectively.\n\nLarge-cap stocks demonstrate their resilience through their ability to increase dividends even in times of market distress. Several leading companies have maintained decades-long streaks of dividend growth, weathering major economic crises such as the 2008 recession and the 2020 pandemic. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that large-cap firms with a track record of consistent dividend increases have shown relative strength during downturns, suffering smaller losses than the broader market. In addition, these companies have often outperformed during periods of market stagnation and have participated in a substantial share of gains during bull markets.\n\nDividend growth is a key factor when evaluating dividend stocks, as companies that consistently raise their payouts have historically outperformed those that do not. A report by RMB Capital found that between 1972 and 2018, companies that initiated or grew their dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.62%, significantly surpassing the 2.40% return of non-dividend-paying firms. Even the broader market, with a 7.30% return, lagged behind dividend growers. The report also emphasized that companies with a strong history of dividend increases have not only sustained but expanded their payouts, even during economic downturns. From a portfolio perspective, dividend growth stocks provide solid diversification, as they are spread across multiple industries. This offers an advantage over high-yield portfolios, which tend to be concentrated in mature sectors like utilities and, prior to 2007, financials.",

            "content": "After pre-announcing that its full-year revenue would come in below its original guidance, Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) announced its full results and reiterated its earlier 2025 forecast. The company has been a big beneficiary of GLP-1 drugs that have seen soaring demand as they have been shown to greatly help with multiple health issues, including weight control.\n\nThe stock has bounced back since lowering its 2024 guidance in mid-January and is now up more than 10% year to date.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the company's results to see if the stock is a buy.\n\nGLP-1 drugs power growth\n\nAfter reducing its guidance last month, Eli Lilly's revenue came pretty much in line with its lowered expectations. In January, the company lowered its 2024 revenue forecast from a range of $45.4 billion to $46 billion to a new outlook of $45 billion, with fourth-quarter revenue projected to be about $13.5 billion. For the quarter, it saw its revenue climb 45% to $13.53 billion, while revenue for the full year jumped 32% to $45.04 billion.\n\nLilly's growth was led by its GLP-1 drugs. For the quarter, revenue for Mounjaro soared 60% year over year to $3.5 billion, while revenue for Zepbound surged from $175.8 million to $1.9 billion. Both Mounjaro and Zepbound have the same active ingredient in tirzepatide and are commonly used to help people lose weight, often through off-label prescriptions. However, they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for different uses. Mounjaro is approved to help improve blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, while Zepbound is approved for weight loss in obese adults or overweight adults with at least one weight-related condition, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure.\n\nLiily's older GLP-1 drug, Trulicity, meanwhile, continues to see its revenue sink as patients move to its newer GLP-1 drugs. Revenue fell 25% in the quarter to $1.3 billion.\n\nHowever, Lilly saw strength in other drugs as well, with overall non-incretin revenue growing 20%. Verzenio, which is used to treat HR+, HER2\u2013 breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, saw sales climb 36% to $1.6 billion. Diabetes medications Jardiance and Humalog saw sales jump 50% and 69% to $1.2 billion and $620 million, respectively. Meanwhile, the autoimmune drug Taltz saw revenue rise 21% to $952 million.\n\nQ4 Revenue Growth (YOY) Mounjaro $3.5 billion 60% Zepbound $1.9 billion 1,080% Verzenio $1.6 billion 36% Trulicity $1.3 billion (25%) Jardiance $1.2 billion 50% Taltz $952 million 21% Humalog $620 million 69%\n\nLilly's U.S. revenue jumped 40% to $9 billion, while international revenue climbed 55% to $4.5 billion. Gross margins, meanwhile, rose 130 basis points to 82.2%.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared, more than doubling to $5.32. That was well ahead of analyst exceptions for EPS of $4.95 as compiled by LSEG.\n\nLooking ahead, the company reiterated the 2025 forecast it gave last month. It is projecting 2025 revenue to range between $58 billion to $61 billion, representing growth between 29% to 36%. It is looking for full-year adjusted EPS to come in between $22.50 and $24.\n\nThe growth is expected to be led by continued GLP-1 drug usage in the U.S. as well as the launch of Mounjaro in new international markets. The company is expected to have 1.6 times as many incretin saleable doses in the first half of this year compared to last year, and it expects its new Concord facility to begin shipping medicine this year. It is also looking to expand commercial access to its GLP-1 drugs and expects improvements in 2025, particularly with Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIt is also seeing solid progress with the launches of Kisunla, a treatment for early Alzheimer's, and ezcema medication Ebglyss. Further out, the company is looking for a full-scale launch of Orforglipron in 2026. Orforglipron is an oral GLP-1 drug that can be used for weight loss. Today, most GLP-1 drugs are injectable.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a buy?\n\nDespite the earlier guidance reduction, Lilly is very well positioned. The company has some of the leading GLP-1 weight-loss drugs on the market, and the introduction of an oral GLP-1 drug in 2026 could be another game-changer. Meanwhile, its other non-GLP-1 drugs are also doing well.\n\nWith the misstep in projecting Q4 revenue behind it, the company's 2025 guidance looks to potentially be pretty conservative. The miss in the quarter was largely due to Lilly projecting that patients would double up on some scripts in December, which did not materialize. These assumptions are not in guidance for next year, nor is the possibility it could have more GLP-1 capacity in the second half.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lilly trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 times 2025 analyst estimates but has a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.4. PEGs below 1 are typically considered undervalued, so on that basis, the stock is attractively valued.\n\nGiven the popularity of GLP-1 drugs and the potential for an oral GLP-1 drug launch in 2026, Lilly remains very well positioned. As such, I think the stock still looks attractive at current levels.",

Shares have performed well in 2025, with a total return of 12% as of the Feb. 11 close. Contributing meaningfully to the stock's rise so far this year was the firm\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings report on Feb. 6. Sales of the company\u2019s GLP-1 drugs are still red-hot.\n\nBut does this mean a rally in Eli Lilly is likely to continue? Below, I\u2019ll discuss essential points from the earnings report and management commentary. I\u2019ll then provide an outlook on the company's shares.\n\nGet Eli Lilly and Company alerts: Sign Up\n\nLilly\u2019s Results Send Shares Higher After Guidance Reset\n\nOn the top-line, Lilly\u2019s revenue grew by 45%, a brisk pace that was in line with expectations. Earnings more than doubled, beating analyst estimates by 6%. Mounjaro and Zepbound, the company\u2019s key drugs, showed strong growth. Mounjaro and Zepbound both contain the same drug, tirzepatide. Mounjaro helps treat type 2 diabetes, while Zepbound is for obesity.\n\nMounjaro sales rose 60% compared to Q4 2023. Zepbound sales rose by 985% to $1.9 billion. However, Q4 2023 was the first quarter Zepbound was available for prescription, a key reason for the astronomic rise. Zepbound sales growth of 52% from Q3 2024 is still highly impressive and provides a fairer view of the drug's sales growth. Despite these rapid growth rates, sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound fell well short of initial analyst predictions. Estimates for this earnings release were reset after the firm released a preliminary update on Jan. 14. The press release resulted in shares plummeting over 6%.\n\nLilly: Taking Market Share, and for Good Reason\n\nOverall, these sales helped Lilly continue closing its gap with Novo Nordisk A/S NYSE: NVO in the U.S. incretin analogs market. Incretin analogs include injectable GLP-1s, oral GLP-1s, and GLP-1/GIP dual agonists. Lilly has been steadily gaining market share on Novo Nordisk since May 2024. It now controls nearly 49% of the market, while Novo controls 51%. This is a 5% improvement compared to Q4 2023.\n\nMuch of this market share gain is due to studies showing that Zepbound is more effective in creating weight loss than Novo\u2019s competing drug, Wegovy. Top-line results from the Phase 3b SURMOUNT-5 study showed that Zepbound provided 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy. Lilly has also been able to rectify issues around keeping up with demand much faster than Novo, another likely contributor to its market share gain. Novo still has its drug, semaglutide, on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shortage list, while the FDA removed Lilly\u2019s in Oct. 2024.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next For Lilly, and Is It a Buy?\n\nOverall, Lilly has a few key ways it can continue to support and expand its expected growth in 2025. First, the company now has the production capacity to prevent a sales bottleneck. Management says it will be able to make 60% more tirzepatide in the first half of 2025 than it did in the same 2024 period. The company also expects Phase 3 trial readouts of its oral incretin drug, orforglipron. It expects results in Q2 for diabetes and in Q3 for obesity. Successful results would be huge.\n\nEli Lilly and Company MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 97th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 26.5% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -2.25 News Sentiment 1.04 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 32.54% See Full Analysis\n\nThe drug will probably cost much less than tirzepatide. This is because pills are easier to make and store than injectables. This could significantly expand who could access incretin drugs. A recent study from the American Journal of Managed Care found that leaders of big U.S. health plans see high costs as the main barrier to coverage for incretin drugs. Lilly also estimates that 20% to 25% of U.S. patients have needle fear. A pill form of medication could expand accessibility to these folks.\n\nWith supply concerns addressed, Lilly plans to launch global access to orforglipron \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d in early 2026. Overall, the possibility of huge near-term upside in Lilly shares hinges largely on the orforglipron results. I won\u2019t speculate on how these results may turn out. I believe Lilly's success in making the most effective approved incretin drug gives it a big edge in this area. This stock is a long-term allocation. It could really excel with its other incretin candidates, even if orforglipron falls short. This provides a long-term opportunity for a market some believe could reach $150 billion in value. The average price targets from Wall Street analysts still see a solid upside in shares of nearly 15%.\n\nBefore you consider Eli Lilly and Company, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

            "content": "Lilly expects to launch Mounjaro in new markets outside of the United States and Europe throughout 2025. The launch of Mounjaro in new international markets is expected to contribute to the drug\u2019s sales growth in the second half of the year.\n\nLilly is hopeful that sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound should pick up in 2025 as it launches the drugs in new international markets and ramps up manufacturing in the first half of the year. Lilly expects to produce at least 60% more salable doses of incretins in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Since 2020, Lilly has committed more than $23 billion for manufacturing capacity for Zepbound and Mounjaro in the United States and Europe.\n\nHowever, quarter-over-quarter growth of Zepbound and Mounjaro in 2024 was hurt by supply and channel dynamics. Slower-than-expected growth and unfavorable channel dynamics hurt sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound in the second half, raising concerns about moderating demand for these drugs.\n\nDespite such a short time on the market, Mounjaro and Zepbound have become key top-line drivers for Lilly in 2024, with demand rising rapidly. Mounjaro and Zepbound generated combined sales of $16.5 billion in 2024, accounting for around 36% of the company\u2019s total revenues.\n\nLet\u2019s understand the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play the stock after the price rise.\n\nThe increase in LLY\u2019s stock price after its earnings left investors wondering whether they should buy, hold or sell the stock.\n\nIn 2025, Lilly expects to record revenues in the range of $58.0 billion to $61.0 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 32%. Earnings per share are expected in the range of $22.50 to $24.00\n\nInvestors were impressed with the company\u2019s outlook for 2025, particularly expectations for improvement in sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound. Last month, Lilly provided its sales outlook for 2025, which it maintained along with the fourth-quarter results.\n\nLilly\u2019s fourth-quarter results were rather uneventful, with the company already announcing preliminary sales numbers and 2025 sales outlook last month. The company beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. Sales of Lilly\u2019s incretin medicines, Mounjaro, Trulicity and Zepbound missed estimates, while that of non-incretin drugs like Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio beat expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApprovals for new indications can also drive sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound higher. In late December, the FDA approved Zepbound for its second indication, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity. In addition, LLY filed tirzepatide for heart failure, which further expands the opportunity for tirzepatide. It also expects to announce data from a cardiovascular outcome study on tirzepatide this year.\n\nIn December, Zepbound outperformed rival Novo Nordisk\u2019s NVO Wegovy (semaglutide) in a weight-loss head-to-head study. In the phase IIIb 72-week study, Zepbound led to an average weight loss of 20.2% of body weightin obese or overweight adults, compared to 13.7% for Wegovy, representing a 47% greater relative weight loss for Zepbound users. The data bodes well for Lilly. It can help drive market share and potentially establish Zepbound as the new standard for obesity medications. In the fourth quarter, Zepbound became the market leader in the anti-obesity market as measured by new prescriptions.\n\nLLY\u2019s New Drugs & Pipeline Success\n\nOther than Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly has gained approvals for some other new drugs in the past couple of years. These include Omvoh for ulcerative colitis, BTK inhibitor Jaypirca for mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and Kisunla (donanemab) for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024.\n\nLilly expects its new drugs, Mounjaro, Zepbound, Omvoh, Jaypirca, Ebglyss and Kisunla, along with the expanded use of existing drugs, to drive sales growth in 2025. It also expects the potential launch of new medicines like imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer to contribute to growth in 2025.\n\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, with several mid to late-stage pipeline readouts expected in 2025.\n\nCompetition Heating Up in the Obesity Space\n\nThe obesity market is heating up and is expected to expand to $100 billion by 2030, according to data from Goldman Sachs. Lilly and Novo presently dominate the market.\n\nLilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development. These include two late-stage candidates, orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 small molecule, and retatrutide, a GGG tri-agonist, and some mid-stage candidates, bimagrumab, eloralintide and mazdutide. It expects data from phase III studies on orforglipron in type II diabetes and obesity in 2025. It also plans to file regulatory applications in obesity this year and for type II diabetes in 2026.\n\nSeveral companies like Amgen AMGN and Viking Therapeutics VKTX are also making rapid progress in the development of GLP-1-based candidates in their clinical pipeline.\n\nAMGN and VKTX\u2019s products can pose strong competition to Mounjaro/Zepbound and NVO\u2019s Ozempic/Wegovy in the future.\n\nLLY\u2019s Stock Price, Valuation and Estimates\n\nLilly\u2019s stock has risen 15.2% in the past year against an increase of 1.8% for the industry.\n\nLLY Stock Outperforms Industry\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock is trading at a premium to the industry, as seen in the chart below.\n\nLLY Stock Valuation\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for Lilly\u2019s 2025 earnings have declined from $23.79 to $23.61 per share in the past seven days while that for 2026 have increased from $31.09 to $31.12 over the same timeframe.\n\nLLY Estimate Movement\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStay Invested in LLY Stock\n\nLilly has its share of problems. Sales of its key medicine, Trulicity, are declining in the United States due to competitive dynamics, including Mounjaro switches and supply constraints. Prices of most of Lilly\u2019s products are declining in the United States mainly due to lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. Lilly\u2019s U.S. net price has declined every year since 2021. In 2025, Lilly expects mid-to high single-digit percentage price decline, including U.S. Part D changes. Potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market is another headwind.\n\nHowever, Lilly\u2019s tremendous success with Mounjaro and Zepbound has made it the largest drugmaker with a market cap of more than $820 billion. Lilly\u2019s stock has gone up by 500% in the past five years, mainly due to its successful new drug launches, particularly Mounjaro and Zepbound, and its solid pipeline potential. Lilly\u2019s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and others, making up for the decline in sales from Trulicity.\n\nThough the disappointing sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound in the second half of 2024 have created a bearish sentiment around the stock, we believe that over time, the supply issues for Mounjaro and Zepbound should be resolved as the company increases production capacity. Also, Lilly looks well placed to get approval for several new drugs and label expansions for marketed drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, in the next few years.\n\nOn capital allocation, LLY returned $3 billion to shareholders in 2024 via share repurchases and dividends. The board of directors of Lilly approved a new $15 billion stock buyback plan and also announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend, which bodes well for the stock.\n\nThough the stock looks quite expensive, we suggest investors who own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company retain it as it still has robust growth prospects.

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$35b in market cap last week.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Eli Lilly. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Eli Lilly, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:LLY Earnings and Revenue Growth February 12th 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Eli Lilly. Lilly Endowment, Inc, Endowment Arm is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.2% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

December\u2019s monthly job gains also showed an upward revision, highlighting that the US labor market ended 2024 in a better position than previously reported. Economists are thus of the opinion that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in the near future. Consequently, this increases pressure on inflation data to cool down before the central bank considers slashing borrowing costs.\n\nOn January 30, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d to discuss the stock market and the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged. Sticking to the opinion he gave in December, Gundlach was of the view that 2025 would bring a maximum of two rate cuts by the Fed. He reiterated that he was not predicting two cuts but that two would be the maximum number attained in 2025, keeping one rate cut as the base case for the year. The unemployment rate went up for several consecutive months before ticking down, which Gundlach thinks is a matter of deep solace for the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Outlook for the Stock Market Look Like?\n\nOn February 10, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth\u2019s chief investment strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss the 2025 outlook for the stock market.

Comparing the current environment to previous periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and the 1990s, Bartels highlighted the role of robotics, AI, and Web3 in driving long-term growth in the present.\n\nShe noted that companies today fund investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage, unlike the 1990s. Her estimates showed that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the decade\u2019s end, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 growth stocks.

Credit: SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images.\n\nEli Lilly is paying up to $630m for a Phase I metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) candidate from South Korea-based biotech OliX Pharmaceuticals, diversifying its pipeline for the disease with an RNA-based asset.\n\nKnown as OLX75016, the candidate is an antisense RNAi oligonucleotide developed using OliX\u2019s therapeutic RNAi platform. OliX focuses on developing therapies by inhibiting the expression of genes that cause disease through its technology.\n\nLilly will make an initial payment to complete a Phase I trial that kicked off in Australia in February 2024. The study, set to enrol 58 healthy subjects, will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of OLX75016.\n\nWhile the ongoing Phase I trial is investigating OLX75016 for the treatment of MASH and liver fibrosis, the candidate is also in preclinical development for the treatment of obesity in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide.\n\nThe $630m agreement includes an upfront payment, as well as development and commercial milestones, according to a securities filing on Korea\u2019s stock exchange.\n\nThe deal establishes Lilly with a diverse pipeline to target the large market opportunity within MASH. The drugmaker\u2019s blockbuster GLP-1RA drug tirzepatide \u2013 the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound \u2013 is being investigated as a treatment for MASH. In a Phase II trial (NCT04166773) readout in June 2024, Lilly reported that 51% to 54.9% of patients achieved an improvement in fibrosis without worsening of their disease at 52 weeks, compared to 21.3% to 25.2% on placebo.\n\nLilly also invested in its nucleic acid infrastructure, unveiling a $700m R&D centre in Boston, US, in August 2024 \u2013 a facility focused on developing novel RNA-based and DNA-based medicine.\n\nMASH is a form of non-alcoholic liver disease, which describes a spectrum of conditions like steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis marked by fat buildup in the liver. The disease, also associated with comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes, has been notoriously difficult to treat.\n\nThe MASH treatment landscape has seen multiple trial failures and setbacks, with companies such as AstraZeneca terminating the development of its MASH therapies. In June 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected Intercept Pharmaceuticals\u2019 new drug application (NDA) for its MASH therapy, obeticholic acid. The FDA cited concerns over the therapy\u2019s safety profile, especially the potential risks of causing liver injury and diabetes.\n\nIn March 2024, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Rezdiffra (resmetirom), a type of thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-beta) agonist, became the first and only approved therapy that does not require a liver biopsy for the treatment of patients with MASH and Stage 2\u20133 fibrosis.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly went on a mini deal-making spree on Monday, inking strategic collaborations with South Korean firm OliX Pharmaceuticals and Australia\u2019s AdvanCell to advance novel cardiometabolic and cancer therapies.\n\nDetails of the OliX agreement were sparse, with the Seongnam-based biotech revealing only that it would \u201creceive an initial payment\u201d from Lilly to complete a Phase I trial of the deal\u2019s centerpiece, an investigational gene silencer dubbed OLX75016, in Australia. Further financial specifics, including potential arrangements for milestones and royalties, were kept under wraps.\n\nOLX75016 is a small interfering RNA therapy being developed for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), liver fibrosis and other cardiometabolic diseases. The asset works by targeting the expression of the MARC1 enzyme, which is involved in the accumulation of lipids in fat cells.\n\nBy suppressing MARC1 expression, OLX75016 could potentially reduce fat content in the liver, obesity and liver fibrosis, all known hallmarks of MASH\u2014and other cardiometabolic conditions including obesity. In February 2024, OliX announced that it had kicked off the Phase I trial of OLX75016 in MASH.\n\nThe OliX deal moves Lilly further into the MASH space. The pharma is currently positioning its blockbuster weight-loss therapy Zepbound for expansion into MASH, with a Phase II readout in June 2024 demonstrating that more than half of patients treated with a 5-mg dose achieved absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks. The efficacy improved with increasing doses such that nearly 75% of patients on 15 mg Zepbound achieved MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis.\n\nLilly at the time said that it has \u201cengaged with regulatory authorities\u201d on the next steps for Zepbound in this indication, though in its full-year 2024 business review, the pharma did not list a MASH submission as one of its potential key events this year.\n\nElsewhere in the MASH space, Lilly\u2019s top obesity competitor Novo Nordisk reported in November 2024 that its own blockbuster therapy Wegovy could clear MASH without worsening of fibrosis in 32.8% of patients at 72 weeks. Novo is also seeking a MASH expansion for Wegovy, with a filing expected in the first half of this year.\n\nAlso on Monday, Lilly partnered with Australian biotech AdvanCell to advance radiopharmaceutical therapies for various types of cancer. As with OliX, the companies did not reveal specific financial details of the agreement, nor did they specify priority indications.\n\nThe collaboration will use AdvanCell\u2019s proprietary targeted alpha platform, which allows it to produce Pb-212-based therapies. AdvanCell also has existing radionuclide development capabilities that it will combine with Lilly\u2019s drug candidate programs to \u201caccelerate the clinical advancement of an expanded portfolio\u201d of radiopharmaceuticals, according to Monday\u2019s press release.",

This ensures that temperature-sensitive medicines including donated medicines, can reach patients in resource-limited settings where access to refrigeration remains a critical barrier.\n\nThe Importance of Cold Chain in Healthcare\n\nCold chain\u00e2\u0080\u0094transporting and storing medicines at specific temperatures\u00e2\u0080\u0094is essential for preserving the effectiveness of many treatments, including biologics and other temperature-sensitive medicines. Insulin, for instance, an essential medicine for people living with diabetes, requires refrigeration at a constant 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. The World Health Organization's Global Diabetes Compact has called on improvements, including expanding cold storage, to ensure medicines are available to those who need them most.\n\n\"Lilly's commitment to health equity goes beyond our own medicines. We use our resources and expertise in key disease areas to drive sustainable solutions to some of the world's toughest health challenges,\" said Cynthia Cardona, Lilly's Vice President of Social Impact. \"Lilly is proud to continue supporting Direct Relief's cold-chain efforts in LMICs, following the successful completion of the first phase. Through Direct Relief's expertise and Lilly's support, we aim to contribute to expanding access to essential medicines in resource-limited settings in LMICs.\"\n\nLilly's support for Direct Relief's cold chain initiative is part of the Lilly 30\u00c3\u009730 initiative, which aims to improve access to quality healthcare for 30 million people living in resource-limited settings annually by 2030. This effort builds on Lilly's long history of advancing equitable access to diabetes care and medicines.\n\n\u201cDirect Relief is privileged to receive support from Lilly yet again, expanding cold storage to even more health providers, giving them the opportunity to safely store essential medications,\u201d said Kelsey Grodzovsky, Director of Programs for Direct Relief. \u201cBuilding refrigeration capacity is key to increasing medication access in low- and middle-income countries around the world, and this infrastructure will allow more patients to receive critical therapies.\u201d\n\nThrough this program, Lilly and Direct Relief are reaffirming their shared commitment to expanding access to temperature-sensitive medicines, ensuring that patients in low- and middle-income countries can receive the care they need to live healthy lives.",

Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +9.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Lilly belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lilly is expected to post earnings of $4.63 per share, indicating a change of +79.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.80 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +83.2%. This estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.89 indicates a change of +29.8% from what Lilly is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lilly.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) fourth-quarter performance exceeded the street expectations, with the company delivering adjusted earnings of $5.32 per share versus the projected $4.95. Revenue came in at $13.5 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $13.6 billion. Lower price realization for Mounjaro led to a top-line miss.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s outlook aligned with the analysts estimates. This boded well with the investors, and the stock trended higher after the results\u2019 announcement. Now, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s revenue of $13.5 billion reflected a solid 45% y-o-y growth, thanks to the high demand for its obesity drug \u2013 Zepbound \u2013 which garnered $1.9 billion in sales. Among other drugs, Mounjaro sales were up 60% y-o-y to $3.5 billion, while Verzenio saw a 36% jump to $1.6 billion. Notably, both Zepbound and Mounjaro sales fell short of the consensus estimates of $1.98 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. While Mounjaro\u2019s sales demonstrated strong growth, pricing challenges tempered its overall performance.\n\nEli Lilly also posted a 90 bps improvement in gross margin to 83.2% in Q4. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $5.32 per share, up over 2x from the $2.49 figure in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, the company expects its top-line to be in the range of $58 billion and $61 billion, gross margin between 41.5% and 43.5%, and the adjusted earnings to be between $22.50 and $24.00.\n\nLLY has delivered impressive returns of 50% year-to-date, significantly outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 28% gain in the same period. The investor optimism stems from massive demand for its obesity treatment. Admirably, LLY stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 66% in 2021, 34% in 2022, 61% in 2023, and 33% in 2024.\n\nSimilarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile, and it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes in the White House, could LLY continue to outperform? From a valuation perspective, we think LLY stock has some room for growth. At its current levels of $870, LLY stock trades at 17x trailing revenues, versus the stock\u2019s average P/S ratio of 14x over the last three years. Now, a rise in valuation multiple for LLY seems justified, given the strong sales growth as well as robust outlook in the coming years. Notably, the $980 average of analysts price estimate for LLY reflects a 12% upside from here.\n\nAlso see \u2013 What\u2019s Happening With GOOG Stock?\n\nWhile LLY stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Eli Lilly peers fare on metrics that matter.

            "content": "Not all growth stocks worth buying these days focus on the artificial intelligence field. There are many exciting ones in other industries -- even in healthcare, a sector some investors might consider boring. Two healthcare stocks that may or may not be boring, but that regardless look like strong growth stocks to invest in this month, are Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT -1.40%).\n\nThe case for Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly has been a terrific stock to own for the past five years, thanks to its excellent clinical and regulatory progress. The company's breakthroughs are paying off. In each of the past six quarters, Eli Lilly's revenues have increased by more than 20% year over year, which is an incredible result for a pharmaceutical giant.\n\nEli Lilly should continue to grow its top line faster than its similarly sized peers. Its lineup features several blockbusters, including its popular diabetes and weight loss medicines, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nIt's true that these drugs' sales are not increasing quite as fast as analysts expected, which has led to the stock declining over the past five months. However, that dip has created a better entry point for long-term investors.\n\nThe company won't stop innovating. It boasts exciting candidates across all clinical trial stages. Eli Lilly's investigational gene therapy for deafness is in early-stage studies and is already showing promise. Last year, the company reported that after treatment with the gene therapy, an 11-year-old patient who had been deaf from birth was able to hear for the first time. Eli Lilly's late-stage pipeline features such products as retatrutide, a potential novel weight loss treatment.\n\nEli Lilly broke new ground with Zepbound. It's a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist, meaning it mimics the action of those two hormones. It was the first treatment of its kind to earn the green light from health regulators. Retatrutide mimics the action of three hormones: GLP-1, GIP, and GCG. Eli Lilly nicknamed this investigational weight loss therapy \"Triple G.\" These examples barely scratch the surface of Eli Lilly's pipeline. Investors can expect significant R&D progress from the company in the next five years and strong financial results.\n\nLastly, Eli Lilly is an excellent dividend growth stock. Management has increased its payouts by a total of almost 103% in the past five years. So both for its growth prospects and its quality as an income investment, Eli Lilly looks like an excellent pick now, especially since its share price performance hasn't been strong recently.\n\n2. Sarepta Therapeutics\n\nSarepta Therapeutics is a biotech that specializes in developing drugs for rare diseases where current treatment options are limited. The company has several drugs on the market that treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a progressive genetic disease that weakens patients' muscles.\n\nThe most important therapy in Sarepta Therapeutics' portfolio is Elevidys, which last year earned full FDA approval for use in ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. The medicine also earned accelerated approval for non-ambulatory patients, so additional trials may be required for it to maintain its approval in that demographic.\n\nIn the meantime, Elevidys is giving a significant boost to Sarepta Therapeutics' financial results, which is unsurprising since there aren't many safe and effective treatment options for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Elevidys, unlike the biotech's other medicines, targets the disease's underlying causes. Sarepta Therapeutics has announced preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.\n\nThe company expects to report $1.8 billion in net revenue for 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. That would be an increase of about 49%.\n\nSarepta Therapeutics recently announced more positive results from a phase 3 study for Elevidys. The company has many other pipeline candidates, including several more potential Duchenne muscular dystrophy therapies. The biotech is also going after other targets.\n\nIt is currently running a phase 3 trial for an investigational therapy for Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy. Sarepta Therapeutics has more than 40 candidates in its pipeline.\n\nBetween those programs and the company's current lineup, which is already driving strong top-line growth, Sarepta Therapeutics could deliver excellent long-term returns.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nEli Lilly & Co. has delivered a strong performance in Q4 2024, with revenue surging 45% year-over-year to $13.53 billion. This growth was primarily driven by its blockbuster drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which continue to dominate the GLP-1 receptor agonist market. The company\u2019s net income doubled compared to Q4 2023, reinforcing its strong financial standing and competitive position.\n\nWith its 2025 guidance projecting revenue between $58.0 billion and $61.0 billion, Eli Lilly is on a trajectory of sustained growth, capitalizing on expanding obesity and diabetes treatment markets. However, the market reaction remains mixed, as investors focus on potential risks, including competition, regulatory pressures, and upcoming data readouts from its Orforglipron (designed to be taken as a once-daily pill) pipeline.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s CEO announced last week plans to submit a new Wegovy weight loss pill for U.S. regulatory approval, aiming for a launch next year. The move positions Novo to compete directly with Orforglipron, which is expected to receive approval by early 2026.\n\nFinancial performance overview\n\nQ4 2024 Highlights (YoY Growth)\n\n\u2022 Revenue: $13.53B (+45%) \u2022 Gross Margin: $11.13B (+47%) \u2022 Net Income (GAAP): $4.41B (+101%) \u2022 EPS (GAAP): $4.88 (+102%)\n\nThe EPS outperformance reflects the operational leverage achieved through higher sales volumes and improved gross margins. The obesity market is huge and very lucrative, and while Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk has enjoyed a duopoly in Diabetes care, Obesity is so much bigger that it has and will attract much more competition. More on that in another article.\n\nRevenue and growth drivers\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s revenue growth is driven by its incretin franchise, consisting of Mounjaro (tirzepatide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide for weight management). The company is strategically expanding its presence in obesity management, where it competes with Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nKey products performance (Q4 2024)\n\nProduct Revenue ($M) YoY growth:\n\nMounjaro 3,530 +60%\n\nZepbound 1,907 N/A\n\nVerzenio 1,555 +36%\n\nTrulicity 1,250 -25%\n\nJardiance 1,198 +50%\n\nTaltz 952 +21%\n\nHumalog 620 +69%\n\nGeographic revenue split\n\n\u2022 U.S. Market: $9.03B (+40%) \u2022 International Markets: $4.50B (+55%)\n\nThe company saw a 56% volume increase in International markets, primarily from Mounjaro\u2019s penetration into new markets.\n\nFuture growth catalysts\n\n\u2022 Regulatory approvals: FDA approved Zepbound for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a market with 30 million U.S. patients. \u2022 Pipeline expansion: Upcoming Orforglipron (oral GLP-1) readouts in Q2 and Q3 2025 will be critical to long-term valuation. \u2022 Manufacturing expansion: $3B investment in Wisconsin for parenteral (injectable) products.\n\nProfitability and margins\n\nGross margin analysis\n\n\u2022 Q4 2024 Gross Margin: 82.2% (vs. 80.9% in Q4 2023)\n\nThe 1.3% points margin expansion was driven by:\n\n\u2022 A favorable product mix (higher sales from high-margin products). \u2022 Operational efficiencies offsetting price reductions in Mounjaro.\n\nOperating expenses & cost control\n\n\u2022 R&D Expenses: $3.02B (+18%) \u2013 Driven by Phase 3 trials and obesity drug development. \u2022 SG&A Expenses: $2.42B (+26%) \u2013 Marketing spend increased for Mounjaro & Zepbound awareness campaigns.\n\nOperating profitability trends\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 43.3% in 2024 reflects its superior capital efficiency, compared to the pharmaceutical sector median of ~15%.\n\nMarket valuation as of February 9, 2025\n\n\u2022 Share Price: $878 \u2022 Market Cap: $793B \u2022 P/E Ratio (2025E): 37.8x \u2022 Enterprise Value (EV): $801B \u2022 EV/EBITDA: 31.1x, using estimates for 2025, although I am more conservative when applying it for valuation\n\nComparison to Industry Peers\n\nValuation: Looking through the DCF lens\n\nUsing a Discounted Cash Flow approach, with the following assumptions:\n\n\u2022 Revenue CAGR (2024-2029): 15% \u2022 Terminal growth rate: 2.5% \u2022 WACC: 7.5% \u2022 EV/EBITDA multiple: 25x (I am probably conservative here, but margin of error is needed at this level)\n\nThe DCF-derived intrinsic value per share is $1,020. That gives an upside of 16% and and IRR of 11%.\n\nRisks & Considerations\n\nKey Risks\n\n1. Regulatory & Pricing Pressure \u2013 Government scrutiny on drug pricing and reimbursement policies could impact margins. 2. Pipeline Execution \u2013 The upcoming Orforglipron readouts (Q2 & Q3 2025) carry risk of disappointment. 3. Competitive Dynamics \u2013 Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic & Wegovy expansion remains a challenge. 4. Manufacturing & Supply Constraints \u2013 Scaling up production to meet GLP-1 demand remains a logistical challenge.\n\nMitigating Factors\n\n\u2022 Strong financial position: Net debt to EBITDA of 0.3x suggests low financial risk. \u2022 Diversified R&D pipeline: Expanding into oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular treatments.\n\nThe company\u00b4s pipeline is very interesting and targeting large, established therapeutic areas and also new areas with unserved needs.\n\nCase for Eli Lilly\n\n\u2705 Market Leader in Obesity & Diabetes: GLP-1 dominance supports high revenue growth.\n\n\u2705 Robust Financial Performance: Margins, ROIC, and cash flow trends outperform the industry.\n\n\u2705 Future Catalysts: New drug approvals, Orforglipron data, and manufacturing scale-up.\n\n\u2705 Valuation Upside: DCF & market multiples suggest $1,020+ per share.\n\nConclusion\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s strong fundamentals, dominant market position, and promising pipeline justify its premium valuation. The stock remains a compelling long-term case. Competition will intensify but it is again also important to point out that Eli Lilly (and Novo Nordisk) will expand its current and near-term technology platforms in new / additional therapeutic areas, that will enable them to find growth outside diabetes and obesity.\n\nWith that, thanks for reading I truly appreciate the interest.

Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 High Growth Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nKen Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Asset Management, a renowned investment and financial analysis expert. He established the firm in 1979 and now has $299 billion in assets under management. Over the years, he has built a legacy of innovative investment strategies, a contrarian approach, and a focus on long-term growth.\n\nInvestment Philosophy and Strategies of Fisher:\n\nCompared with many other firms, Fisher Investments\u2019 most distinctive aspects are its methodical approach to portfolio management and its reliance on research. In his 1984 book Super Stocks, he popularized the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to find undervalued growth stocks. The ratio continues to play a key role in his firm\u2019s stock selection process, helping to uncover companies with strong growth prospects that might be hidden from the broader market.\n\nFisher\u2019s contrarian mentality distinguishes him from most investors. He advises questioning mainstream market sentiments and looking for opportunities others might miss. His book The Only Three Questions That Count examines this more in-depth, explaining how good investors must constantly challenge their view of the world, find insights no one else sees, and combat mental biases to find the right investment opportunity.\n\nDiversified Portfolio and Sector Emphasis:\n\nThe firm\u2019s holdings express Fisher\u2019s long-held maxim that diversification helps reduce risk. Technology is a particularly strong-performing sector, accounting for 31.8% of the portfolio as of Q3 2024, displaying Fisher\u2019s faith in the enduring rise of tech stocks. The portfolio is also heavy in other sectors, such as services (14.6%), financial services (12.3%), and healthcare (10.5%).\n\nIn 2024, Fisher Investments achieved an incredible 32.18% return, fueled mainly by its tech positions, especially in companies that benefited from the artificial intelligence boom. While many investors have become cautious about frothy tech valuations, Fisher\u2019s firm has remained steadfast, doubling down on AI chipmakers and other tech innovators.\n\nRecent Developments:\n\nIn January 2025, Fisher Investments finalized the sale of a minority stake valued at nearly $3 billion to Advent International and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing the firm at approximately $13 billion. The decision is a strategic move that has been a part of Ken Fisher\u2019s long-term estate planning, allowing the firm to continue its private independence and never-ending commitment to outstanding client service. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high growth stocks in Ken Fisher\u2019s portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo analyze Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 High Growth Stock Picks, we began by reviewing the largest positions in Fisher Asset Management\u2019s portfolio as of Q3 2024. We focused on identifying stocks with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of at least 20% compared to 2023, as this growth metric highlights companies demonstrating robust expansion. We then picked the first ten stocks that met the growth criteria, providing a clear overview of high-growth opportunities in the portfolio.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNet revenue growth in the past 12 months: 27.41%\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical powerhouse renowned for pioneering advancements in therapeutic areas such as diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) reported robust financial performance in Q3 2024, with revenue surging 20% year-over-year to $11.44 billion, driven by the strong performance of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. These medications have significantly bolstered the company\u2019s foothold in the weight-loss drug market, contributing substantially to revenue growth.\n\nThe company has also made strides in expanding its portfolio and market reach. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is in advanced negotiations to acquire cancer-focused biotech Scorpion Therapeutics for up to $2.5 billion. This move aims to diversify its pipeline with promising oncology treatments, signaling a strategic focus on strengthening its presence in the cancer treatment space.\n\nAdditionally, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s Zepbound recently received FDA approval for treating obstructive sleep apnea in obese patients. This approval allows Medicare Part D plans to cover the drug for this specific use, potentially generating over 3.7 million new prescriptions annually. This regulatory milestone could significantly increase the drug\u2019s market potential.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also bolstering its manufacturing capacity with a $3 billion investment in a newly acquired facility in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, to support its growing pipeline and meet increased demand for its innovative therapies.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 2nd on our list of Ken Fisher\u2019s top high growth stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Data from this study will be presented at the Crohn's and Colitis Congress (CCC), being held from February 6-8, 2025 in San Francisco .1\n\nOmvoh works to reduce inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract by targeting a specific protein, interleukin-23p19 (IL-23p19), which is a key contributor to intestinal inflammation.2,3\n\n\"Many people living with Crohn's disease have tried available therapies without success or have experienced a loss of efficacy with their treatment,\" said Edward Barnes , M.D., MPH, Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology , Co-Director of the Multidisciplinary Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . \"These positive, multi-year data can give health care providers confidence that Omvoh may help their patients achieve and maintain long-term outcomes, including intestinal healing.\"\n\nParticipants randomized to Omvoh in the Phase 3 VIVID-1 study who achieved endoscopic response after one year of treatment continued Omvoh maintenance treatment in VIVID-2. The following results were achieved based upon observed case analysis after two years of continuous treatment, including one year during VIVID-1:\n\nAmong patients who were in clinical remission at one year in VIVID-1, 92.9% maintained clinical remission at two years as measured by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI).\n\nAmong patients treated in VIVID-2, 87.6% maintained endoscopic response, defined by visible healing of the intestinal lining and measured by a \u226550% reduction from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) total score.\n\nAmong patients who were in endoscopic remission at one year of treatment in VIVID-1, 78.6% maintained endoscopic remission at two years as measured by SES-CD \u22644 and \u22652-point reduction from baseline, with no subscore >1 in any individual variable.1\n\nAdditionally:\n\nAmong patients who were not in clinical remission by CDAI at one year, 60.8% gained clinical remission during the second year of treatment.\n\nAmong patients who were not in endoscopic remission at one year, 35.4% gained endoscopic remission during the second year of treatment.1\n\nThese results were also evaluated using a modified non-responder imputation method, presented in the About the VIVID Clinical Trial Program section below.\n\nIn VIVID-2, the long-term safety profile of Omvoh in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease was generally consistent with the known safety profile of Omvoh. During the second year of continuous treatment with Omvoh, 6.8% of patients with endoscopic response at one year reported a serious adverse event and 0.8% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.1\n\n\"Lilly is setting a high bar for sustained and durable treatment response for patients living with the profound impact of inflammatory bowel disease,\" said Mark Genovese , M.D., senior vice president of Lilly Immunology development. \"These results build on the body of evidence that demonstrates Omvoh's ability to provide early meaningful improvement and long-term disease control with strong clinical, endoscopic and histologic outcomes.\"\n\nOmvoh was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults in January 2025 . In December 2024 , the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion for Omvoh for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Lilly has submitted marketing applications around the globe, including in Canada, Japan and China, with additional global regulatory submissions planned. Omvoh is also approved in 44 countries for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults.\n\nOmvoh is the first and only IL-23p19 antagonist to demonstrate long-term, multi-year, sustained efficacy and safety for both Crohn's disease and UC.\n\nOmvoh has additional ongoing trials in Crohn's disease and UC, including studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Omvoh in pediatric patients and adults, and a Phase 4 real-world evidence study to evaluate Omvoh's impact in patients with UC in clinical practice.\n\nAbout the VIVID Clinical Trial Program\n\nVIVID-1 was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients randomized to Omvoh received Omvoh 900mg by intravenous (IV) infusion at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 8 followed by a maintenance dose of 300mg by subcutaneous injection (SC) at Week 12 and then every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 40 weeks.2\n\nParticipants who completed VIVID-1, including the Week 52 endoscopy, were eligible for VIVID-2. In VIVID-2, the primary objective is to evaluate the long-term e\ufb00ect of Omvoh in clinical remission by CDAI and endoscopic response at Week 52 of treatment in VIVID-2 (totaling 104 weeks of continuous treatment). Safety is being assessed from the \ufb01rst dose in VIVID-2.1\n\nUsing a modified non-responder imputation method, among Omvoh endoscopic responders at year one, 81.8% maintained endoscopic response at two years, 86.9% maintained clinical remission at two years, and 72.5% maintained endoscopic remission at two years.1\n\nAbout Omvoh\u00ae\n\nOmvoh\u00ae (mirikizumab-mkrz) is an interleukin-23p19 antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in adults. Omvoh selectively targets the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits the IL-23 pathway. Inflammation due to over-activation of the IL-23 pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.4\n\nOmvoh\u00ae and its delivery device base are trademarks owned by Eli Lilly and Company .\n\nIndications and Usage for Omvoh \u00ae (mirikizumab-mrkz) (in the United States )\n\nOmvoh is an interleukin-23 antagonist indicated for adults with:\n\nModerately to severely active ulcerative colitis\n\nModerately to severely active Crohn's disease\n\nImportant Safety Information for Omvoh (mirikizumab-mrkz)\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\nOmvoh is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to mirikizumab-mrkz or any of the excipients.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions\n\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during intravenous infusion, have been reported with Omvoh administration. Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, including mucocutaneous erythema and pruritus, were reported during induction. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Omvoh immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.\n\nInfections\n\nOmvoh may increase the risk of infection. Do not initiate treatment with Omvoh in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and bene\ufb01ts prior to prescribing Omvoh. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops or an infection is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer Omvoh until the infection resolves.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Omvoh. Do not administer Omvoh to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering Omvoh. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of Omvoh in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be con\ufb01rmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after Omvoh treatment. In clinical trials, subjects were excluded if they had evidence of active TB, a history of active TB, or were diagnosed with latent TB at screening.\n\nHepatotoxicity\n\nDrug-induced liver injury in conjunction with pruritus was reported in a clinical trial subject following a longer than recommended induction regimen. Omvoh was discontinued. Liver test abnormalities eventually returned to baseline. Evaluate liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and for at least 24 weeks of treatment. Monitor thereafter according to routine patient management. Consider other treatment options in patients with evidence of liver cirrhosis. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. Interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, until this diagnosis is excluded. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction.\n\nImmunizations\n\nAvoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Omvoh. Medications that interact with the immune system may increase the risk of infection following administration of live vaccines. Prior to initiating therapy, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. No data are available on the response to live or non-live vaccines in patients treated with Omvoh.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nMost common adverse reactions associated with Omvoh (\u22652% of subjects and at a higher frequency than placebo) in ulcerative colitis treatment are upper respiratory tract infections and arthralgia during the induction study (UC-1), and upper respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions, arthralgia, rash, headache, and herpes viral infection during the maintenance study (UC-2). Most common adverse reactions associated with Omvoh in the Crohn's disease study (CD-1) (\u22655% of subjects and at a higher frequency than placebo) are upper respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions, headache, arthralgia, and elevated liver tests.\n\nOmvoh injection is available as a 300 mg/15 mL solution in a single-dose vial for intravenous infusion, and as a 100 mg/mL solution or a 200 mg/2 mL solution in a single dose pre\ufb01lled pen or pre\ufb01lled syringe for subcutaneous injection.

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

The volume increase was driven by growth from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Lower realized prices were primarily driven by Mounjaro, partially offset by Zepbound and Humalog. New Products1 revenue grew by $3.15 billion to $5.64 billion in Q4 2024, led by Zepbound and Mounjaro. Growth Products2 revenue increased 13% to $5.95 billion in Q4 2024 driven by growth in Verzenio and Jardiance, partially offset by lower Trulicity sales. The growth in Jardiance revenue included a one-time benefit of $300.0 million associated with an amendment to the company's collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim .\n\n1 Lilly defines new products as select products launched since 2022, which currently consist of Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh and Zepbound. 2 Lilly defines Growth Products as select products launched prior to 2022, which currently consist of Cyramza, Emgality, Jardiance, Olumiant, Retevmo, Taltz, Trulicity, Tyvyt and Verzenio.\n\nRevenue in the U.S. increased 40% to $9.03 billion , driven by a 45% increase in volume, partially offset by a 5% decrease due to lower realized prices. The increase in U.S. volume was primarily driven by Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by Trulicity. The lower realized prices in the U.S. were primarily driven by Mounjaro, partially offset by Zepbound and Humalog.\n\nRevenue outside the U.S. increased 55% to $4.50 billion , driven by a 56% increase in volume. The volume increase outside the U.S was driven primarily by Mounjaro and, to a lesser extent, Verzenio. This volume increase also reflected the aforementioned $300.0 million payment received related to Jardiance.\n\nGross margin increased 47% to $11.13 billion in Q4 2024. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 82.2%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower realized prices.\n\nIn Q4 2024, research and development expenses increased 18% to $3.02 billion , or 22.3% of revenue, driven by continued investments in the company's early and late-stage portfolio.\n\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26% to $2.42 billion in Q4 2024, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches.\n\nIn Q4 2024, the company recognized acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $189.2 million compared with $622.6 million in Q4 2023. The Q4 2023 charges primarily related to the acquisition of Mablink Biosciences SAS and the business development transaction with Beam Therapeutics Inc.\n\nIn Q4 2024, the company recognized asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges of $344.0 million , compared with $67.7 million in Q4 2023. The charges in Q4 2024 primarily included an intangible asset impairment associated with Vitrakvi.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 12.5% in Q4 2024 compared with 12.7% in Q4 2023. The effective tax rate for Q4 2024 reflects a higher net discrete tax benefit compared with Q4 2023, as well as the favorable tax impact of the Vitrakvi impairment charge, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.\n\nIn Q4 2024, net income and earnings per share (EPS) were $4 .41 billion and $4.88 , respectively, compared with net income of $2 .19 billion and EPS of $2.42 in Q4 2023. EPS in Q4 2024 and Q4 2023 included acquired IPR&D charges of $0.19 and $0.62 , respectively.\n\nFourth-Quarter Non-GAAP Measures\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Q4 2024 gross margin increased 46.0% to $11.26 billion . Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 83.2%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower realized prices.\n\nThe effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 13.2% in Q4 2024 compared with 13.1% in Q4 2023. The effective tax rate for Q4 2024 was unfavorably impacted by a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a higher net discrete tax benefit compared with Q4 2023.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Q4 2024 net income and EPS were $4.81 billion and $5.32 , respectively, compared with net income of $2 .25 billion and EPS of $2.49 in Q4 2023.

Revenue outside the U.S. increased to $898.9 million compared with $100.5 million in Q4 2023, primarily driven by volume growth in launched markets.\n\nVerzenio\n\nFor Q4 2024, worldwide Verzenio revenue increased 36% to $1.56 billion . U.S. revenue was $1.04 billion , an increase of 35%, primarily driven by increased demand and wholesaler buying patterns. Revenue outside the U.S. was $513.0 million , an increase of 38%, primarily driven by increased demand.\n\nTrulicity\n\nFor Q4 2024, worldwide Trulicity revenue decreased 25% to $1.25 billion . U.S. revenue decreased 36% to $799.8 million , driven by decreased sales volume primarily due to competitive dynamics and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 9% to $450.4 million , driven by higher realized prices and increased volume.\n\nZepbound\n\nFor Q4 2024, U.S. Zepbound revenue was $1.91 billion , compared with $175.8 million in Q4 2023. Zepbound launched in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in November 2023 .\n\nJardiance\n\nFor Q4 2024, the company's worldwide Jardiance revenue increased 50% compared with Q4 2023 to $1 .20 billion. U.S. revenue was $464.5 million , a decrease of 1%, driven by lower realized prices, largely offset by increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. was $733 .9 million, compared with $329 .1 million in Q4 2023, primarily driven by a one-time payment received of $300.0 million associated with an amendment to the company's collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim . Pursuant to the amendment, we and Boehringer Ingelheim adjusted commercialization responsibilities for Jardiance within certain smaller markets.\n\nJardiance is part of the company's alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim . Lilly reports as revenue royalties received on net sales of Jardiance.\n\nTaltz\n\nFor Q4 2024, worldwide Taltz revenue increased 21% to $952 .0 million. U.S. revenue increased 24% to $665 .5 million, driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, as well as increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 16% to $286 .5 million, primarily driven by increased demand.\n\nHumalog\n\nFor Q4 2024, worldwide Humalog revenue increased 69% to $619.9 million . U.S. revenue was $405.8 million compared with $167.6 million in Q4 2023, driven by higher realized prices primarily due to a one-time impact in Q4 2023 related to the implementation of list price decreases. Revenue outside the U.S. was $214.1 million , an increase of 8%, driven by higher realized prices in China and, to a lesser extent, increased volume.\n\n2025 Financial Guidance\n\nThe company anticipates 2025 revenue to be between $58.0 billion and $61.0 billion . The midpoint represents approximately 32% growth compared to 2024, driven by new Lilly medicines such as Zepbound, Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Ebglyss, Omvoh and Kisunla; approvals of new indications for existing Lilly medicines; launches of Mounjaro in additional worldwide markets; and potential launches of new medicines such as imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer. The company continues to invest heavily in increasing manufacturing capacity and estimates producing at least 1.6 times the amount of salable incretin doses in the first half of 2025, compared to the first half of 2024.\n\nThe ratio of (Gross Margin - OPEX) / Revenue, where OPEX is defined as the sum of research and development expenses and marketing, selling and administrative expenses, is expected to be in the range of 40.5% and 42.5% on a reported basis and 41.5% and 43.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\n\nOther income (expense) is expected to be expense in the range of $700 million to $600 million , primarily driven by higher interest expense.\n\nThe 2025 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 16%.\n\nEPS for 2025 is expected to be in the range of $22.05 to $23.55 on a reported basis and $22.50 to $24.00 on a non-GAAP basis.

            "content": "Eli Lilly\u2019s profit doubled in the fourth quarter, propelled by its hot-selling diabetes and obesity treatments, and the drugmaker came out with a mostly better-than-expected 2025 forecast.\n\nSales of Lilly\u2019s top-selling product, the diabetes treatment Mounjaro, jumped 60% to $3.53 billion in the final quarter of 2024 while its obesity treatment counterpart Zepbound brought in $1.9 billion. Both figures fell short of expectations on Wall Street but reflect a forecast Lilly made last month.\n\nRevenue from the breast cancer treatment Verzenio also helped in the fourth quarter, climbing 36% to $1.55 billion.\n\nOverall, Lilly\u2019s quarterly profit swelled to $4.41 billion. Revenue advanced 45% to $13.53 billion, in line with expectations. Per-share earnings adjusted for one-time items totaled $5.32, easily topping the $5.01 that Wall Street was looking for, according to a poll of industry analysts by FactSet.\n\nMounjaro and Zepbound are part of a wave of diabetes and obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that are soaring in popularity globally due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. They compete with Ozempic and Wegovy from the Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which also reported strong sales growth on Wednesday.\n\nFor 2024, Mounjaro sales more than doubled to $11.54 billion, while Zepbound notched sales of $4.9 billion in its first full year on the market.\n\nAnalysts expect more than $18 billion in sales from Mounjaro this year and over $10 billion from Zepbound, which was recently approved in the United States as a treatment for some forms of sleep apnea.\n\nAdditional approvals like that and Lilly\u2019s push to increase manufacturing should lead to ongoing, solid growth for the drugs, Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in a research note.\n\nFor 2025, the Indianapolis drugmaker expects adjusted earnings to range between $22.50 and $24 with revenue falling between $58 billion and $61 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings of $22.77 per share on $58.8 billion in revenue.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. shares climbed about 2% Thursday morning to $857.40 while broader trading indexes started the day mixed.\n\nLilly\u2019s stock has already climbed 9% so far this year, as of Wednesday.",

Zepbound and Mounjaro have now underperformed expectations for two straight quarters, with the company previously pointing to issues around inventory decreases among wholesalers.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant also issued fiscal 2025 profit guidance of $22.05 to $23.55 per share, which is in line with what analysts were expecting. Eli Lilly reiterated its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, noting that it expects to launch Mounjaro in new international markets throughout the year.\n\nEli Lilly expects to see \"a continuation of basically the total prescription growth that we have seen in 2024\" for incretin drugs such as Zepbound and Mounjaro, \"so that's what we built in our 2025 guidance for the market,\" the company's CFO Lucas Montarce said during an earnings call on Thursday.\n\nShares of Eli Lilly rose more than 4% on Thursday.\n\nThe figures were consistent with the preliminary results Eli Lilly shared in January, which disappointed investors. Eli Lilly had slashed its 2024 revenue guidance, as it said demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs would not meet its lofty expectations.\n\nNotably, Eli Lilly said it plans to report late-stage data on its next-generation obesity drug retatrutide later this year, a few months earlier than expected. Retatrutide works differently from any of the treatments on the market, mimicking three different hunger-regulating hormones: GLP-1, GIP and glucagon.\n\nHere's what Eli Lilly reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $5.32 adjusted vs. $4.95 expected\n\n$5.32 adjusted vs. $4.95 expected Revenue: $13.53 billion vs. $13.57 billion expected\n\nThe company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $13.53 billion, up 45% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with a profit of $2.19 billion, or $2.42 a share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $5.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings for 2024 on Thursday. The results largely beat Wall Street estimates and sent the stock up about 2%. But the company missed on GLP-1 sales.\n\nThe pharma giant has had a few hits and misses in the past few months: The FDA removed its GLP-1 tirzepatide drugs from the drug shortage list, which shuts down compounding pharmacy knockoffs, but the company also revised its fourth quarter 2024 guidance lower last month.\n\nThe fourth quarter results showed a 45% increase in revenue, to $13.5 billion, from sales of its GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro, for diabetes, and Zepbound, for weight loss. Mounjaro brought in $11.5 billion alone, a 124% increase from 2023, and Zepbound totaled $4.9 billion. Still, the Mounjaro numbers missed Wall Street estimates but matched revised guidance.\n\nMizuho's healthcare sector expert Jared Holz wrote in a note to clients that Lilly remains the \"preeminent growth story in large-cap pharma and one of the best in all of healthcare.\"\n\nFor the full year, Lilly reported $45 billion in revenue, up 32% from the prior year.\n\nLilly is one of two market leaders in the GLP-1 space and is slowly gaining ground on Danish competitor Novo Nordisk (NVO), which reported record sales of GLP-1s Wednesday.\n\nBut the company is more than just a diabetes and obesity drug company, and that is where investors are focused on for Lilly's long-term prospects. In the last few years, it has been favored as the potential first trillion-dollar health company due to GLP-1 profits. But the stock has come off last year's highs of $960 per share, currently trading at below $850 per share. Still, it remains one of the more highly valued big pharma companies.\n\nLike its competitor, Lilly is also pursuing clinical trials in various other diseases for its GLP-1 drugs \u2014 which creates a larger potential patient population. It just received FDA approval for use as a sleep disorder drug.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is also ahead of the pack in developing a pill option. Orforglipron is currently awaiting the results of its phase III trial and could be ready for the market by 2026.\n\n\"Beyond guidance, we think investor focus will be on mgmt commentary around TRx [prescription]/volume/coverage dynamics for Mounjaro/Zepbound as well as any color on orforglipron (which is expected to be filed in obesity in 2025),\" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\n\nHe added the company is still a strong investment despite the slight miss on Thursday.\n\n\"More broadly on LLY, we continue to see the company as optimally positioned in an incretin market that we see growing to ~$200bn+ over time with a number of additional opportunities in the company\u2019s pipeline, including orforglipron,\" Schott wrote.",

Non-GAAP earnings reached $4.81 billion, or $5.32 a share. Analysts had been expecting non-GAAP earnings of $5.11 a share, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger.\n\nFor the full year, Lilly told investors to expect non-GAAP earnings of $22.50 to $24 a share, meeting or exceeding analyst forecasts. Consensus for that figure was below $23, offering another positive note to Lilly\u2019s earnings report, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. The company\u2019s shares climbed almost 5%, to around $881 apiece, in midday trading Thursday.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe profit figures offered reassurance for investors after Lilly told investors in January that it had overestimated demand for diabetes and obesity medicines. The company\u2019s shares tumbled almost 7% on Jan. 14, when Lilly issued new revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and 2025.\n\nSince that time, Lilly\u2019s stock price has recovered the losses and more, helped by a broader market increase and an expanded approval for its inflammatory bowel disease drug Omvoh. And even if sales of its top sellers weren\u2019t quite as high as expected in the fourth quarter, Lilly\u2019s diabetes and obesity drugs are still experiencing significant growth.\n\nSales of the diabetes medication Mounjaro jumped 60% in the fourth quarter to $3.5 billion; revenue from the newer Zepbound obesity drug reached $1.9 billion, compared with $175.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Lilly is looking to take market share from rival Novo Nordisk in the obesity market after a head-to-head trial showed Zepbound helped patients lose more weight than Wegovy.\n\nThe market for these incretin drugs \u201ccontinues to grow rapidly, and Mounjaro and Zepbound are both gaining share,\u201d CEO Dave Ricks told investors during a conference call. \u201cWe believe both products are still very early in their launch cycle.\u201d\n\nFor the full year, Lilly reiterated its overall revenue guidance of between $58 billion and $61 billion. After a series of investments in manufacturing, the company expects to be able to produce at least 1.6 times as many incretin doses in the first half of 2025 as it did in the year-earlier period.\n\nBoth Lilly and Novo are also pushing ahead with next-generation drugs. While reporting its own earnings Wednesday, Novo released details of a new Phase 3 trial of its experimental obesity drug CagriSema.",

            "content": "While all eyes are on the commercials set to run during Super Bowl LIX, Eli Lilly and Company opted to advertise during another widely-watched live event: the 67th Grammy Awards.\n\nLilly rolled out its latest 60-second TV ad during the annual music awards show on Sunday evening, spotlighting breast cancer awareness in front of the program\u2019s largely female audience.\n\nThe spot, titled Hands, is the latest iteration of Lilly\u2019s Get Better corporate brand campaign, which launched last year.\n\nThe ad showcases the point-of-view of a woman who uses her hands throughout a host of daily activities, from playing piano and gardening to washing her hair in the shower.\n\nIt then shows the woman sitting in a doctor\u2019s office, presumably being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\u201cThe most powerful way to fight cancer is in your hands,\u201d the spot concludes, underscoring the importance of early detection and diagnosis while emphasizing patient empowerment.\n\nUltimately, Hands ran in front of an audience of 15.4 million viewers, according to same-day ratings from Nielsen.\n\nThe marketing push at the Grammy\u2019s represents yet another example of Lilly leaning into popular cultural moments to make an impression on patients.\n\nIn March, the drugmaker aired two short films on the night of the 96th Academy Awards to promote its GLP-1 drugs and challenge stigmas around obesity.\n\nThen, during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, Lilly went full press with its advertising and partnerships with Team U.S.A \u2014 specifically gold medalist gymnast Simone Biles.\n\nFor this commercial, the drugmaker decided to marshal its resources behind a serious disease state and the changing conversation around treating and living with cancer.\n\nLina Polimeni, chief corporate brand officer at Lilly, noted that the inspiration behind Hands was rooted in the everyday experience of regular people.\n\n\u201cWhat we try to do with every piece of creative is to depict the human experience and the lived experience of people that are struggling with these diseases,\u201d Polimeni explained.\n\nWhile many people still view cancer as a death sentence, she said Lilly wanted to underscore the significant advancements in therapies available \u2014 as well as the power of an early diagnosis for improved prognosis.\n\nThe end goal is to encourage women to get mammograms earlier rather than wait out of fear and potentially delay much-needed care interventions.\n\n\u201cThe inspiration was this desire to let people understand that there\u2019s so much power in self-examination for women and there\u2019s so much more control and hope that comes with an early diagnosis,\u201d she said.\n\nThe breast cancer awareness effort, which was developed in partnership with agency Wieden+Kennedy, coincided with a record-breaking year for women at the Grammys.\n\nTop honors at the awards show went to Chappell Roan, Doechii and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 who took home her first-ever Album of the Year for Cowboy Carter.\n\nThough Lilly couldn\u2019t have predicted the winners, the focus on women artists provided even more reason for the company to air Hands during the Grammys.\n\nPolimeni said it was the right place to \u201creach as many women as possible\u201d due to its audience skewing younger and more female.\n\n\u201cWe tried to lean into [the film being] a bit different from traditional pharma ads, in the sense that we want to be where cultural conversations are,\u201d Polimeni said.\n\nThus far, the ads comprising Lilly\u2019s overarching Get Better corporate brand campaign have spurred a 57% increase in consumer trust in the brand, according to Polimeni.\n\nPart of the success has been focusing its messaging on disease states and medical conditions with impassioned patient populations like obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\u201cThe most moving thing for me has been the consumer responses we\u2019ve received,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving been in this industry for over 20 years, usually no news is good news for pharma \u2014 but in this case, we had a lot of proactive [feedback] on how much that film hit home.\u201d\n\nLilly plans to expand its scope in future ads and Polimeni hinted at experiential activations beyond video \u2014 ideally at other events with cultural significance.\n\nShe explained that Lilly\u2019s ambition is to evolve Get Better from a corporate brand campaign and medical conversation into a cultural one centered on health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about treatment, we\u2019re talking about the importance of health,\u201d Polimeni said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a conversation that should happen in everyday life, because health and life go hand-in-hand.\u201d\n\nFor a February 2025 article on Eli Lilly expanding its Zepbound vial offerings, click here.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) investors should expect fireworks this week as the pharma giant prepares to drop its bombshell Q4 2024 earnings figures before tomorrow\u2019s bell. Given recent price action, a buy-the-dip scenario could be on the cards.\n\nThe company fumbled its previous earnings call, leading to a 6% drop in the stock late last year. With market performance set to return to equilibrium, LLY could be the low-hanging fruit speculators are looking for while also appealing to long-term value investors who appreciate dividends and long-term growth.\n\nSo far this year, LLY is up 7% and primed to continue its uptrend on the back of key business unit catalysts. Over the past 3 years, the stock has been up almost 250% while generating $1.5 per share in dividends.\n\nI\u2019ve been bullish on Eli Lilly for a while, and the recent pullback makes this reliable pharma giant even more attractive. LLY\u2019s key target market is set to grow rapidly over the next two years, and the company is well-positioned to capitalize on it\u2014especially with the launch of its oral weight-loss drug, Orforglipron.\n\nEarnings Announcement Set to Propel LLY Stock Higher\n\nEli Lilly is set to report Q4 2024 earnings on February 6, 2025, with management expecting $13.5 billion in revenue\u2014a massive 45% year-over-year jump. Driving this surge? Explosive demand for its weight-loss drugs Mounjaro ($3.5 billion) and Zepbound ($1.9 billion). Looking ahead, Lilly forecasts $58\u2013$61 billion in 2025 revenue, marking a staggering 32% growth at the midpoint.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s stock dipped after its Q4 guidance came in lower than expected. With a P/E ratio of 85.9, any slowdown was bound to trigger a sell-off. While demand for GLP-1 drugs isn\u2019t growing as fast as some hoped, seasonality may be at play\u2014meaning a more substantial rebound could be coming as the new financial year kicks off.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) has the edge with Rybelsus, its already-approved oral GLP-1, and trades at a much lower P/E of just 27, making it the more reasonable value play. Meanwhile, Lilly is the high-growth bet, with a pipeline that could deliver big wins beyond weight loss; I\u2019m impressed by its upcoming oral GLP-1 (Orforglipron) and an Alzheimer\u2019s drug in the works.\n\nI only own NVO right now, but LLY\u2019s potential is hard to ignore. It\u2019s pricier, but the diversified pipeline and strong momentum make the stock tempting, especially on a medium-term horizon. Tough call\u2014do I stick with Novo, add Lilly, or go all in on both?\n\nHigh Valuations Leave No Room for Error\n\nWith a towering price-to-earnings ratio nearing 90, Eli Lilly has little margin for error or underperformance. Yet, genuinely great companies often command premium valuations. My main caution is that its P/E ratio has surged 45% above its five-year average. However, this is hardly a red flag given that its earnings growth rate is 232% higher over the same period.\n\nIf I\u2019ve learned one thing in investing, it\u2019s that the market loves companies with plenty to admire under the hood. With January 2027 revenue of $75 billion, a net income margin of 35%, and 890 million diluted shares, the company will have diluted earnings per share of $29.50. From there, it only needs to trade at a moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 40 to reach my $1,200 price target\u2014significant growth from the current $825 per share.\n\nHowever, investors could face significant risk if the weight-loss market loses momentum over the next two years. Emerging long-term side effects could lead to reduced demand and cautious stocking by pharmacies, triggering stock price volatility amid lower revenue projections.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not investing too heavily in GLP-1 stocks. Like AI stocks, their sky-high valuations and potential shifts in demand make me believe it\u2019s wiser to hold these companies for a few years rather than taking a rigid buy-and-hold approach.\n\nEli Lilly Is Worth More than GLP-1 Drugs\n\nLilly isn\u2019t just riding the weight-loss drug wave\u2014it\u2019s building a balanced, future-proof pipeline. By diversifying its portfolio, the company reduces risk and strengthens investor confidence. Also, Lilly focuses on biologics rather than small-molecule drugs, making them more challenging for competitors to replicate. If all goes well, new treatments for various diseases like Donanemab, Mirikizumab, and Lebrikizumab could bring in up to $15 billion annually by 2030.\n\nMoreover, Eli Lilly\u2019s leadership is a powerhouse. Under CEO David Ricks, who took the helm in 2017, the company has thrived and outpaced its Big Pharma rivals with exceptional stock performance and steadily climbing dividends. What\u2019s the secret? Smart acquisitions, relentless cost control, and a laser focus on high-growth opportunities. By strategically investing in innovation while keeping expenses in check, Lilly has generated massive free cash flow, fueling its future pipeline and delivering value to investors.\n\nThe more I dig into Eli Lilly\u2019s business, the more confident I become. Beyond the GLP-1 hype, there\u2019s a powerhouse of innovation, thoughtful leadership, and a rock-solid pipeline. This isn\u2019t just a weight-loss drug story\u2014it\u2019s a long-term growth machine. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m staying bullish.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOn Wall Street, Eli Lilly holds a Strong Buy consensus rating of 16 Buy, two Hold, and zero Sell ratings. The average LLY price target of $1,002 per share suggests a 21.3% upside over the next 12 months, reinforcing my bullish outlook. Even the lowest target of $900 offers a solid return from the current $825.\n\nLLY Stands Out as a Superb Medium-Term Returns Generator\n\nEli Lilly is a powerhouse with a strong track record of success, including a 16-year dividend track record. This week\u2019s Q4 earnings announcement will be a pivotal moment for investors, with the potential to catalyze the ongoing uptrend or push LLY into breaking its uptrend and allow the stock to reel further losses as investor confidence is shaken.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s earnings stumble, LLY has rebounded strongly, and its long-term growth story remains intact. With a healthy 250% gain over the past 3 years, steady-eddy dividends, and several popular drugs being commercialized \u2014 this pharma giant is well-positioned. While any stock can see ups and downs, Wall Street remains bullish, and demand for GLP-1 medications is undeniable\u2014making LLY a smart buy.\n\nThe pharma titan\u2019s future looks secure and set for further expansion with a diverse pipeline of innovative drugs that dovetails with growing consumer trends. Meanwhile, the recent pullback offers medium-long-term investors a superb market entry opportunity.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Investors are hoping to hit the reset button with Eli Lilly 's earnings report on Thursday morning. In mid-January, the maker of obesity medication Zepbound lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast as sales of the GLP-1 drug ramped up slower than anticipated. The warning followed disappointing third-quarter results in October, which led to months of choppy stock performance. Shares are trying to regain momentum, with a 9% advance since the year began. However, the stock closed Tuesday 15% below the 52-week high of $972.53 that was reached in late August, when many thought the company was on a runway to hit a $1 trillion valuation. Reliability will be key to turning around the stock's performance. Analysts surveyed by LSEG predict Lilly will earn $4.95 per share on $13.59 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. And they are projecting earnings will rise to $22.86 per share on sales of $59.21 billion in 2025. To be sure, it has been a challenge for Lilly to live up to the hype around weight loss drugs, but it also must hit the targets it sets for itself, analysts say. 'Derisked' \"Lilly has already endured the pain of its full year 2024 earnings, having released approximate topline revenue numbers, and Zepbound and Mounjaro revenue figures too,\" Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen wrote in a note to clients. \"Revenue for the year was a $400m miss vs the bottom end of company guidance and incretin revenues too missed vs consensus.\" Breen said the results are \"derisked,\" but investors will still be keyed into tirzepatide's outlook, especially given the expansion of its label to include treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. And investors also want to hear more about Lilly's pipeline, including an update on orforglipron , an experimental pill for obesity. Zepbound and rival Wegovy are both administered via an injection. An oral option would be easier to manufacture and would likely be preferred by some patients. According to FactSet, on average analysts predict Zepbound sales will more than double in 2025 to $10.39 billion from the prior year, while Mounjaro sales are expected to rise from an estimated $11.63 billion in 2024 to $18.17 billion in 2025. Heading into the quarterly results, Wall Street's confidence has been shaky. Several analysts have lowered price targets for the stock, with the average now at $982.25, per LSEG. That's about 16% above where it is currently trading. LLY 1Y mountain Eli Lilly shares over the past year. Both Lilly and its competitor Novo Nordisk have invested billions to boost manufacturing capacity of their game-changing obesity treatments. GLP-1 drugs, which also treat diabetes, mimic stomach hormones in the body to regulate blood sugar, slow down how quickly the stomach empties and suppress appetite. Wall Street has made eye-popping predictions about how large the market could grow for Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competing drug Wegovy given the large number of Americans who are struggling with obesity and overweight. Some analysts expect these drugs to become as common as blood pressure medications over time. A turf war Demand already has been strong enough to cause periodic shortages of the drugs, a situation that allowed compounding pharmacies to step in and offer their own legal versions of GLP-1. The window for these copycats is closing for Zepbound, which is no longer in shortage , according to the Food and Drug Administration. Wegovy and Ozempic hope to come off the list shortly, according to Novo Nordisk. Both sides are fighting to protect their turf , and challenges to the agency's decisions are ongoing. While GLP-1 drugs are the fastest-growing part of Lilly's portfolio, there are other drugs investors will be looking to hear about, including Verzenio, which is becoming the standard of care for a specific type of breast cancer; Omvoh, a treatment for ulcerative colitis; and Kisunla, its Alzheimer's treatment. Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal said he expects there is strength across Lilly's diversified portfolio. Still, he was among the analysts who revised his price target lower for Lilly shares. Bansal expects the company will forecast 2025 earnings in the range of $23 to $24.50 per share. \"While we still do not view LLY as facing a demand issue, we think the total diabetes/obesity opportunity is becoming somewhat of a show-me story with investors needing to closely track script trends to see if supply, access efforts, and demand generation are paying off,\" he said. The bounce in Novo Nordisk's shares on Wednesday was encouraging. Novo's NYSE-listed shares were up more than 4% on the back of earnings that topped expectations. Lilly shares rose more than 2% as well. Novo Nordisk was upbeat about the outlook for obesity treatments, with CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen telling CNBC that the company expects to bring a weight loss pill to the U.S. market before Eli Lilly. One development that might excite investors would be a decision to split Eli Lilly stock. Bank of America included it on a list of companies that the firm believes might consider a stock split based on the shares' lofty price and the company's recent strength.",

Credit: Shutterstock / New Africa.\n\nA US university has launched a prevention trial examining the use of Eli Lilly\u2019s investigational remternetug in young adults to prevent further development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nWashington University School of Medicine has announced the first participants enrolled as part of its Alzheimer\u2019s disease DIAN-TU-002 primary prevention trial (NCT06647498).\n\nThe trial aims to enrol 240 participants from families with mutations in one of the three key genes and a family history of Alzheimer\u2019s that puts them at risk of developing it at some point in their 30s. Some participants will be as young as 18.\n\nThe goal of the study is to determine if the investigational monoclonal antibody remternetug can remove plaques of a key amyloid beta (A\u00df) plaques from the brain or even keep them from building up in the first place during early asymptomatic stages of the condition.\n\nThis is the second in a set of three studies taking place as part of the platform Knight Family DIAN-TU trial (NCT05552157). These trials are set on examining the prevention or treatment for those at high genetic risk of developing the disease that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) says cost the US economy as much as $305bn in 2020.\n\nThe platform trial is set to be run alongside the NIH-funded research group, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), a group that tracks families with mutations in any of three genes that cause Alzheimer\u2019s at a young age.\n\nThe university describes the master protocol as a Phase II/III multi-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing if it is possible to prevent A\u00df deposition in mutation carriers and if that can avert a cascade of pathology associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nEric McDade, professor of neurology at the university and principal investigator for the DIAN-TU-002 trial, said: \u201cWe have seen tremendous progress in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the past few years.\n\n\u201cTwo amyloid-targeting drugs were shown to slow symptoms of the disease and have now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatments for people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cThis provides strong support for our hypothesis that intervening when A\u00df plaques are at the very earliest stage, long before symptoms arise, could prevent symptoms from emerging in the first place.\u201d\n\nThere are two other trials being carried out under the DIAN-TU platform trial. The first, DIAN-TU 001 (NCT01760005) is a Phase II/III double-blind trial examining the safety and efficacy of Eisai\u2019s candidate E2814, alongside Leqembi (lecanemab). The study previously investigated Roche\u2019s gantenerumab, however, Roche would later choose to discontinue its production of gantenerumab after data from other Alzheimer\u2019s trials was not supportive.\n\nDIAN-TU 003 (NCT06384573) is a Phase IIIb/IV open-label study also examining Leqembi in patients who were previously dosed with Roche\u2019s gantenerumab in the DIAN-001 trial before the drug\u2019s discontinuation.\n\nWhen these trials were first announced in 2021, investigators had also chosen to use gantenerumab in the DIAN-TU 002 trial.\n\nMark Mintun, group vice president of neuroscience R&D at Eli Lilly, commented: \u201cWe are pleased to partner with the DIAN-TU team to evaluate whether remternetug can help slow or prevent the accumulation of amyloid plaque, a defining event in the early cascade of Alzheimer\u2019s disease onset.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly has already had a big impact on the Alzheimer\u2019s disease market with Kisunla (donanemab), which was approved by the FDA on 2 July 2024, with UK approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Authority (MHRA) in October. The drug, however, has not been approved for use by the National Health Service (NHS).\n\nLilly\u2019s biggest competitor in the space is Biogen and Eisai\u2019s Leqembi, which holds a first-to-market advantage after receiving approval from the FDA in July 2023. Biogen and Eisai had another therapy, Aduhelm (aducanumab) on the market but Biogen pulled the drug in January 2024, stating the company wanted \u201cto reprioritise its resources in Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d.\n\nThis advantage is set to continue benefitting Biogen and Eisai for future years, with GlobalData predicting the drug will hit $5.33bn in global sales in 2030 while Lilly\u2019s Kisunla is expected to make sales of $1.79bn in the same year.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.",

The lone hold rating is also the only analyst with a price target below the stock's current level, with the average price target at almost $986\u2014a premium of about 19% above Tuesday's closing price.\n\nEli Lilly is expected to report $13.56 billion in revenue, up 45% year-over-year as the weight-loss drugs have boosted Eli Lilly's revenue over the last several quarters. Net income is projected to more than double from the same time last year to $4.52 billion, or $4.99 per share, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nEarnings Follow Lowered Sales Forecast\n\nEli Lilly's earnings comes after the drugmaker again lowered expectations for its fourth-quarter sales last month and its third-quarter results disappointed in October.\n\nThe company said in January that sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound had grown slower than expected in the latest quarter, with fourth-quarter and full-year revenue expected to come in around $13.5 billion and $45 billion, respectively. CEO David Ricks also said in January that the company expects production of \"salable doses\" of its weight-loss drugs to be 60% higher in the first half of this year compared with that period in 2024.\n\nEli Lilly and weight-loss drugmaker rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), which makes Ozempic and Wegovy, have watched demand continuously outpace their supply of the weight-loss drugs. Lilly's drugs were removed from the Food and Drug Administration's shortage list late last year, and the companies have each spent billions on increasing their production capacity.\n\nEli Lilly shares have gained about 17% over the last 12 months, at $826.07 as of Tuesday's close.\n\nUPDATE\u2014Feb. 4, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to comment on the DeepSeek fallout. He shared that while the performance of the Chinese AI model was impressive, especially as it had managed to match models such as OpenAI's o1, there were other factors to consider particularly when gauging the demand for high-end Blackwell GPUs. These GPUs are made by Wall Street's favorite AI GPU firm, and Cramer is increasingly starting to tilt towards the fact that their true magic might lie in enabling the proper functioning of humanoid robots.\n\nAs for the stock, the CNBC TV host continued to assert that there is a large chunk of traders that do not properly understand the company. Cramer shared \"I was in a bar last week, person to the right said I bought [the GPU stock] because of you. A person left said I bought [the GPU stock] cause of you.\" He added that in response he asked does \"anyone know what [the GPU stock] does?\" Yet, instead of outlining the firm's business model, \"They said yeah! It's something that you recommend!\" he added.\n\nWhile the GPU company might have lost close to $600 billion in value during the selloff, another AI news caught Cramer's attention. This was a Reuters report that claimed that OpenAI was seeking to raise $40 billion in capital on a $400 billion valuation. When asked how such valuation was possible, particularly after Monday's havoc, Cramer replied \"So I was just being like you. It is, without a doubt, a time not of inflation, but of a recognition.\" He added that this 'recognition' is why he likes the GPU firm as well. So what is the recognition that's got Cramer enamored? Well, according to him \"it's a recognition that it is a new industrial revolution. And anybody who's in it is a worth lot more than the people that aren't!\"\n\nHe also sardonically targeted co-host David Faber and said \"Look I'm sure that when they discovered the cotton gin, and you're a weaver, you're saying you know what, that's ridiculous!\" Not satisfied, Cramer continued \"Remember the steam engine? Are you still liking the wheel and the pulley? Are you the wedge? You're the wedge!\"\n\nCramer also commented on the market moving higher during the day after the week's devastation. He mentioned a couple of non-tech sectors that had particularly done well. In his words:",

            "content": "Visit the News Hub News Release International Alzheimer\u2019s prevention trial in young adults begins WashU Medicine-led trial evaluating investigational drug from Eli Lilly and Company aims to stop disease before symptoms arise by Tamara Schneider\u2022February 4, 2025 Huy Mach Primary Prevention trial participant Hannah Richardson, 24, undergoes a clinical exam given by WashU Medicine neurologist Nupur Ghoshal, MD, PhD. The international trial, led by WashU Medicine, aims to determine whether stopping the early molecular changes that lead to symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease can prevent the disease from ever taking hold.\n\nThe first participants in an international clinical trial aimed at preventing Alzheimer\u2019s disease in young adults at high risk of the disease have been enrolled. The trial, led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, aims to determine whether stopping the early molecular changes that lead to symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease can prevent the disease from ever taking hold. The study is enrolling people as young as 18 who have few or no detectable Alzheimer\u2019s-related molecular changes in their brains, up to 25 years before the expected onset of dementia symptoms.\n\nWhile the trial is limited to members of families with genetic mutations that all but guarantee they will develop Alzheimer\u2019s at a young age, typically in their 30s, 40s or 50s, the researchers expect that the study\u2019s results will inform prevention and treatment efforts for all forms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nCalled the Primary Prevention Trial, the new study investigates whether remternetug \u2014 an investigational antibody being developed by Eli Lilly and Company \u2014 can remove plaques of a key Alzheimer\u2019s protein called amyloid beta from the brain or block them from accumulating in the first place. Both genetic and nongenetic forms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease start with amyloid slowly collecting in the brain two decades before memory and thinking problems arise. By clearing out low levels of amyloid beta plaques or preventing them from accumulating during the early, asymptomatic phase of the disease, or both, the researchers hope to interrupt the disease process at the earliest stage and spare people from ever developing symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe have seen tremendous progress in the treatment of Alzheimer disease in the past few years,\u201d said Eric McDade, DO, a professor of neurology and the trial\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cTwo amyloid-targeting drugs were shown to slow symptoms of the disease and have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatments for people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This provides strong support for our hypothesis that intervening when amyloid beta plaques are at the very earliest stage, long before symptoms arise, could prevent symptoms from emerging in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe trial is part of the Knight Family Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network-Trials Unit (Knight Family DIAN-TU), a clinical trials platform designed to find medicines to prevent or treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is closely associated with DIAN, a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded international research network led by WashU Medicine that involves research institutes in North America, Australia, Europe, Asia and South America. DIAN follows families with mutations in any of three genes that cause Alzheimer\u2019s at a young age. A child born into such a family has a 50% chance of inheriting such a mutation, and those who do so typically develop signs of dementia near the same age his or her parent did. All the participants in the Primary Prevention Trial come from such families.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather passed away from Alzheimer\u2019s, and so did his mother and all but one of his brothers,\u201d said Hannah Richardson, 24, a participant in the Primary Prevention Trial. \u201cMy mom and my uncle have been participating in DIAN trials since I was about 10 years old. My mom was always very open about her diagnosis and how it spurred her advocacy for Alzheimer\u2019s research, and I\u2019ve always known I wanted to follow in her footsteps. I am happy to be involved in the Primary Prevention Trial and be involved in research because I know how important it is.\u201d\n\nMatt Miller\n\nThe trial was first announced in 2021. At that time, the researchers planned to use a different investigational drug \u2014 gantenerumab, by Roche/Genentech. However, Roche/Genentech discontinued the development of gantenerumab after data from other Alzheimer\u2019s trials were not supportive.\n\nRemternetug was chosen as a replacement because, in early phase trials in symptomatic patients with more common forms of Alzheimer\u2019s, it has been shown to robustly remove amyloid plaques to a comparable extent as donanemab, an FDA-approved Alzheimer\u2019s therapy also produced by Lilly. Importantly, remternetug can be given via injection just under the skin, a faster and less invasive route of administration than IV infusion, which is how the approved treatments are currently delivered. Additionally, participants will receive remternetug or placebo every 3 months, a less frequent dosing schedule than the bi-weekly or monthly dosing schedules required for the two FDA-approved Alzheimer\u2019s medications. The results will help scientists determine the optimal dosing schedule for prevention.\n\nEach participant will be treated for two years. McDade expects to report the results of the trial within the next four to five years, depending on how long it takes to meet enrollment goals.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with the DIAN-TU team to evaluate whether remternetug can help slow or prevent the accumulation of amyloid plaque, a defining event in the early cascade of Alzheimer\u2019s disease onset,\u201d said Mark Mintun, MD, Group Vice President-Neuroscience R&D at Lilly.\n\nThe Primary Prevention Trial will enroll about 240 participants from families that carry mutations in one of the three key genes that cause early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Both those who have and have not inherited the mutation are eligible, with noncarriers serving as a comparison group for their relatives. Participants must be 11 to 25 years younger than the expected age of symptom onset based on their family history, and have no signs of cognitive impairment and no or very few amyloid deposits in their brains. At the end of the experimental period, participants who carry a mutation will be eligible to receive the drug for an additional four years as part of an open-label extension of the study.\n\nMcDade and colleagues are primarily looking to see whether remternetug prevents amyloid plaques from building up in the brain. They will also be measuring the effects of the drug on molecular signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Because the participants are so young, the researchers do not expect to see any changes to cognitive function during the time period of the trial. WashU Medicine will continue following participants long-term beyond the clinical trial to assess for the potential effects on cognition.\n\nMore than $130 million has been earmarked for the trial, including grants totaling an estimated $98.3 million from the NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging (NIA) and $14 million from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and the GHR Foundation. The NIA has been a major supporter of DIAN and its clinical trials unit since the network was established in 2008.\n\n\u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association is proud to be a longstanding part of this strong collaboration between academic researchers, government, industry, philanthropy and the DIAN families,\u201d said Maria C. Carrillo, PhD, Alzheimer\u2019s Association chief science officer and medical affairs lead. \u201cThis innovative study in this special Alzheimer\u2019s patient population has the potential to significantly impact how we prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease, saving individuals and families from the anguish of this fatal disease.\u201d\n\nIn addition, WashU has pledged to raise an additional $6.5 million, and longtime WashU benefactor and Alzheimer\u2019s research supporters Joanne Knight of St. Louis and family have committed up to $11.5 million in support of the trial.\n\n\u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease has impacted our family for decades across multiple generations,\u201d said Joanne Knight. \u201cWe are so thrilled to have the opportunity to support this trial aimed at preventing the devastating effects of the disease.\u201d\n\nAlready, the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Primary Prevention Challenge has garnered contributions from more than 150 donors. The trial is being conducted in close partnership with Lilly, which also is providing significant funding.\n\n\u201cThis a groundbreaking approach,\u201d said GHR Foundation\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Fred Miller. \u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re working to prevent the buildup of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology before it starts. The research will provide insight on how we prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease for these families, as well as the nearly 13 million Americans projected to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 2050 and countless others around the world.\u201d\n\nAlong with the Knight Family DIAN-TU Primary Prevention Trial, WashU Medicine also runs the international Knight Family DIAN-TU Tau NexGen Trial, which is aimed at identifying drugs to prevent or slow Alzheimer\u2019s. Like the Primary Prevention Trial, the Tau NexGen Trial involves members of families that carry dominant Alzheimer\u2019s mutations, but those in Tau NexGen are at or near the age of symptom onset and have already accumulated significant brain changes. Tau NexGen evaluates whether a combination of the FDA-approved drug lecanemab, which targets amyloid, and another drug that targets an Alzheimer\u2019s-related protein called tau can reverse, halt or slow the progression of disease.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "The UK\u2019s regulatory authority for pharmacies on Monday announced that it will require online dispensers to employ stricter checks for patients seeking weight loss injections, according to several media reports.\n\nThe General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)\u2014which sets standards for online and physical pharmacies\u2014will no longer allow online sellers to provide weight loss medicines on the basis of online questionnaires alone, according to the BBC. The announcement covers drugs like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro. Instead, pharmacies will need to independently verify the information that patients provide.\n\nPatients and pharmacies should not rely \u201csolely on an online questionnaire but instead using a method of two-way communication . . . which allows the person to ask questions and the prescriber to get all the information they need to prescribe safely,\u201d the GPhC said in its website.\n\nMeasures that could be part of this verification process may include video or in-person consultations to determine the patients\u2019 body mass index. Pharmacies will also need to cross-reference information from other doctor and medical records.\n\nPharmacies that fail to comply could be subjected to GPhC investigations and inspections, alongside other enforcement actions, according to the BBC report.\n\nThe new GPhC guidelines come amid growing concern about the overuse and safety of obesity therapies. In December 2024 top officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) published an opinion piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association, noting that while weight loss injections could prove \u201ctransformative\u201d for treating obesity, \u201cmedication in isolation will not be enough to address the obesity crisis.\u201d\n\nInstead, health systems should employ a holistic response to obesity, one \u201cthat ensures universally available services to prevent, treat, and manage the disease in a way that is accessible, affordable, and sustainable,\u201d the WHO officials argued. They also recommended \u201ca whole of society approach\u201d that includes health promotion, disease prevention and effective food and urban environment policies.\n\nSimilarly, Stephen Powis, national medical director of England\u2019s National Health Service, expressed his alarm in June 2024 that may people have been using weight loss injections for cosmetic ends, treating them as \u201ca quick fix\u201d to obesity, as per the BBC.\n\n\u201cDrugs including Ozempic and Wegovy should only be used by people prescribed them for obesity or diabetes\u2014I\u2019m worried about reports that people are misusing them\u2014they are not intended as a quick fix for people trying to get beach-body ready,\u201d Powis said.",

            "content": "Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger has reiterated their bullish stance on LLY stock, giving a Buy rating yesterday.\n\nDavid Risinger\u2019s rating is based on several optimistic expectations surrounding Eli Lilly\u2019s development of orforglipron, their once-daily oral GLP-1 treatment. The company\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Dan Skovronsky, has projected that this treatment will demonstrate efficacy and safety comparable to Novo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide, which is administered weekly. Particularly encouraging is the absence of liver toxicity concerns, a significant factor as seen with Pfizer\u2019s discontinuation of a similar drug due to such issues.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing Phase 3 trials involve a substantial sample size, with most trials fully enrolled, indicating strong progress and commitment. Risinger anticipates that if initial trial results are compelling and free from liver toxicity risks, there could be a favorable market response, potentially boosting Eli Lilly\u2019s stock value. The trials are designed to provide insights into both diabetes management and weight loss, with upcoming disclosures expected in 2025. This strategic development positions Eli Lilly positively in the competitive landscape, justifying the Buy rating.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Truist Financial also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $1,038.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Some people are fair-weather friends; others are lifelong. It's a similar story with stocks. Some you might hold only temporarily, while others you own for decades.\n\nThree Fool.com contributors have identified healthcare stocks they think belong in the latter category. Here's why they view Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%), Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.47%), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 1.51%) as magnificent stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nEli Lilly is a growth beast that looks unstoppable\n\nDavid Jagielski (Eli Lilly): A forever stock you can put in your portfolio and not worry about is Eli Lilly. The healthcare company's robust financials, solid pipeline of drugs, and growing dividend highlight three of the best reasons to invest in the business.\n\nThe company is experiencing impressive growth due to its GLP-1 drugs, and those treatments are still in their early innings. For 2025, the company expects its revenue to come in between $58 billion and $61 billion, for a solid growth rate of 32%. And with a robust and growing pipeline, which currently features two dozen phase 3 trials in progress, there may be a lot more growth on the horizon for the company in the future.\n\nEli Lilly's terrific profit margins, which are in excess of 20%, also enable the business to reinvest earnings back into its operations to continue pumping money into research and development efforts and expanding its pipeline.\n\nWhile its payout ratio of over 80% may seem high, that will come down as Eli Lilly continues scaling its operations. And the company has also been incredibly generous with dividend increases, as it has doubled its payout in a span of just five years. If not for the stock's fantastic returns in recent years, its dividend yield of 0.8% would be much higher than it is today, but that's a trade-off investors are likely to be more than happy with, as shares of Eli Lilly have soared 240% in three years.\n\nWhile the pharma stock's valuation may not be cheap (it trades at more than 80 times earnings), it's a premium that's arguably worth paying, given how solid the business is. Eli Lilly's tremendous growth prospects and fantastic earnings numbers make it a no-brainer buy for the long haul.\n\nIgnore the noise and stay the course\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Novo Nordisk): The past six months have been tumultuous for Novo Nordisk. The company's financial results, though strong, haven't quite lived up to expectations.\n\nWe can say the same about the drugmaker's next-gen weight loss medicine, CagriSema, which produced a mean weight loss of 22.7% in a phase 3 study, which is excellent but not quite the 25% management had predicted. These issues have led to Novo Nordisk's shares underperforming the market in the past few months.\n\nHowever, this slump represents an excellent opportunity for long-term investors, as Novo Nordisk should still be able to deliver superior returns over the long run. Consider the company's pipeline, which is still producing gems. Novo Nordisk followed up on the CagriSema disappointment with highly encouraging results from a phase 1b/2a study for subcutaneous amycretin. The company's pipeline in the weight loss market looks exciting, and it boasts candidates across many other therapeutic areas.\n\nNovo Nordisk's financial results should improve as it launches new products and wins new indications for existing medicines. Last year, it earned approval for Awiqli, a once-weekly insulin product, in several regions. It just earned a label expansion for Ozempic in reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease.\n\nBeyond Novo Nordisk's current lineup and portfolio of approved medicines, the company seems to have a drug discovery engine, which for decades has allowed it to dominate the diabetes market.\n\nNovo Nordisk's ability to innovate is perhaps its greatest strength. That's why it can deliver outsized returns over the long run, just as it has in the past. So investors should look beyond Novo Nordisk's recent headwinds. The stock remains a no-brainer pick for pharmaceutical investors.\n\nAn innovation dynamo\n\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Around 109,000 people have cystic fibrosis (CF). Only one company markets therapies that treat the underlying cause of their genetic disease: Vertex Pharmaceuticals. With the recent U.S. approval of Alyftrek, Vertex now has its most convenient and powerful CF therapy yet.\n\nVertex's CF franchise has made the big biotech company highly profitable. However, branching out beyond CF is highlighting just how much of an innovation dynamo that Vertex is.\n\nFor years, patients often had to turn to opioid drugs to alleviate their acute pain. Vertex's research into pain signal inhibitors enabled it to develop suzetrigine as a non-opioid alternative. Unsurprisingly, this therapy has an opportunity to be another blockbuster drug for the company.\n\nVertex leveraged its expertise in CF to target another disease that impacts even more patients -- APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). It's now evaluating inaxaplin in a late-state clinical trial targeting AMKD.\n\nArguably, the most intriguing pipeline focus for Vertex, though, is on curing type 1 diabetes (T1D). The big drugmaker has two potentially curative T1D therapies in clinical development, including zimislecel in phase 3 testing.\n\nVertex has wisely incorporated advances made by other innovative companies, too. For example, it partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics to develop and ultimately market Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy that's a one-time treatment for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.\n\nI like Vertex's CF monopoly. I love its growth prospects thanks to a strong pipeline. Therefore, I don't think there's any doubt that this is a magnificent stock to buy and hold forever.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly Prepares for Strong Earnings Report Amid High Analyst Expectations\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is set to announce its fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday, and the anticipation is high. Analysts attribute this enthusiasm to the company's popular weight-loss drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, whose lack of shortage has bolstered investor confidence. This sentiment is echoed in a recent analysis, highlighting the company's promising sales trajectory.\n\nAccording to data from the IndexBox platform, Eli Lilly is projected to report a remarkable $13.63 billion in revenue, reflecting over a 45% increase compared to the previous year. This surge in sales comes as no surprise as the demand for their weight-loss solutions has continuously driven growth over multiple quarters. Impressively, the company's net income is expected to more than double to $4.58 billion, translating to $5.06 per share as estimated by Visible Alpha.\n\nThe financial community remains largely optimistic about Eli Lilly's market position. Out of 11 analysts closely monitoring the company, 10 have rated its stock as a \"buy,\" with only one analyst advising a \"hold.\" The consensus average price target hovers around $986, representing a 21% premium over current intraday trading levels. This bullish outlook persists despite recent disclosures that sales for Zepbound and Mounjaro did not meet anticipated targets in the latest quarter.\n\nEli Lilly has strategically invested in enhancing its production capabilities, a move mirrored by its rival, Novo Nordisk, known for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The market sees both companies working tirelessly to align production with substantial demand, evidenced by the removal of Lilly's drugs from the FDA's shortage list late last year.\n\nAs Eli Lilly's stock maintains a robust performance over the past year, with a more than 20% increase, investors and industry experts will be closely watching the upcoming earnings report for further insights on the company's future trajectory.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends.

Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin.

At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials.

            "content": "Over the past six months, Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) has underperformed broader equities. While that's not much of an issue in the grand scheme of things, it is still a bit surprising, since the pharmaceutical giant is one of the undisputed leaders in the exciting market for weight loss drugs.\n\nIt turns out that the anti-obesity space isn't growing as fast as Eli Lilly or analysts anticipated, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue for the company's famous weight management drug, Zepbound.\n\nThat's one of the key reasons Eli Lilly hasn't performed as well in recent months. Since many of its prospects are tied to its portfolio of drugs addressing obesity,, some investors might be wondering if it's best to avoid the company right now. Is that the best course of action? Let's find out.\n\nRich valuation metrics, high expectations\n\nEli Lilly recently said it would post revenue of about $45 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. While that would represent a year-over-year increase of 32% -- an otherwise incredible performance for a pharmaceutical giant -- it's still $400 million below the low end of the most recent guidance of $45.4 billion to $46 billion it gave in its third-quarter earnings report, which was also a decreased projection.\n\nIn a recent press release, Eli Lilly's management said that the U.S. incretin market, which includes drugs like Zepbound and Mounjaro, didn't grow as fast as it anticipated in the fourth quarter. Besides the fact that the market doesn't like a company missing its own guidance, Eli Lilly is held to an especially high standard because of its steep valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently just under 36.\n\nFor reference, the average for the healthcare industry is less than half Eli Lilly's at 17. If the drugmaker continues to underperform in the very market where investors have the highest hopes, the company's stock could continue to struggle, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nNot just a weight loss company\n\nWe could point out that tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, is still undergoing many clinical trials and should earn key label expansions. Last year, the medicine aced a phase 3 study in which it delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes who were overweight or obese. We could also highlight the fact that Eli Lilly's weight loss pipeline is one of the strongest in the industry.\n\nHowever, since analysts may have overestimated how large the weight loss market will be, we should look at the rest of Eli Lilly's portfolio. The good news is that the drugmaker has many other medicines that will drive top-line growth, including several new ones. Over the past two years, Eli Lilly has earned approval for such products as Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment Kisunla, ulcerative colitis drug Omvoh, cancer medicine Jaypirca, and eczema therapy Ebglyss.\n\nKisunla looks particularly attractive due to the significant unmet need in AD. These relatively new approvals join a lineup of several older medicines whose sales are still growing at a good clip, including immunosuppressant Taltz, cancer drug Verzenio, and fast-acting insulin Humalog. And that's before we get into the company's pipeline, which features plenty of investigational drugs beyond Eli Lilly's core area of diabetes and obesity.\n\nMind your investment horizon\n\nEven with Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound not growing as fast as many anticipated, these medicines are still beating records. Few drugs generate more than $1 billion in peak annual sales. Both are already well above that number each quarter. Eli Lilly's sell-off may have been justified six months ago. But the company's current forward P/E, which is twice that of the healthcare industry, may well be warranted. Few healthcare giants, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, can grow their revenues or earnings at half of what the drugmaker has been posting of late.\n\nBeyond Eli Lilly's financial results, investors have to account for other things. The company is a proven innovator, a key attribute for drugmakers to thrive over long periods. Furthermore, Eli Lilly has an excellent dividend growth program, making it a solid pick for income seekers.\n\nSo, should investors give up on Eli Lilly? Only those interested in what will happen in the next six months to two years. It's next to impossible to predict what will happen in such a short period (by stock market standards). However, investors focused on the long game have nothing to fear. Eli Lilly remains an excellent pick for them.",

            "content": "You may think that with a price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 17.9x Eli Lilly and Company ( ) is a stock to avoid completely, seeing as almost half of all the Pharmaceuticals companies in the United States have P/S ratios under 3.2x and even P/S lower than 0.9x aren't out of the ordinary. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/S.\n\nWhat Does Eli Lilly's Recent Performance Look Like?\n\nEli Lilly could be doing better as it's been growing revenue less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this lacklustre revenue performance will improve markedly. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.\n\nIs There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Eli Lilly?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Eli Lilly's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as steep as Eli Lilly's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry decidedly.\n\nIf we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 27%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow revenue by 47% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenue over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 24% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the industry predicted to deliver 23% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable revenue result.\n\nWith this information, we find it interesting that Eli Lilly is trading at a high P/S compared to the industry. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of revenue growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Eli Lilly's P/S?\n\nWe'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nSeeing as its revenues are forecast to grow in line with the wider industry, it would appear that Eli Lilly currently trades on a higher than expected P/S. When we see revenue growth that just matches the industry, we don't expect elevates P/S figures to remain inflated for the long-term. A positive change is needed in order to justify the current price-to-sales ratio.\n\nYou should always think about risks.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer has shared his thoughts on.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently revisited one of his core investment principles: \u201cNobody ever made a dime panicking.\u201d He emphasized that, no matter how many times he has shared this advice, it always feels as crucial as the first time. Observing the current turmoil in tech stocks, Cramer pointed out that panic selling leads to missing out on the recovery that often follows. Specifically, he noted how those who sold their tech holdings this week missed the subsequent surge in tech stocks that delivered strong returns.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and 7 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer explained that the panic was so widespread that it even affected the stocks of companies that were benefiting from the tech boom. He observed that even when good news was on the horizon, fear caused investors to make rushed decisions. He then discussed how a Chinese company recently announced a new innovation suggesting that fewer NVDA chips are needed for artificial intelligence applications.\n\n\u201cThe companies that are doing well might even do better if DeepSeek\u2019s formula for success spreads, bunch of knuckleheads.\u201d\n\nWhile Cramer acknowledged that this new technology, such as DeepSeek\u2019s offering, posed a potential threat to NVDA, he quickly said, \u201cThe way I see it, that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d However, Cramer was particularly critical of how the market reacted to this news. He pointed out that the panic was so intense that even companies benefiting from the tech sector\u2019s growth were dragged down.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: The shoot first ask-questions-later approach works when there\u2019s fraud or chicanery and we know we must sell but when things are complicated or murky, it might not make sense to help create the biggest single-day dollar loss in history, chums. There\u2019s a better way. Just don\u2019t do anything. If you really wanna sell, you can do it into the rebound the next day. In my experience, after one more dip in the morning, you almost always get a better price.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on January 28 and 30. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nCramer mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) during an episode of Mad Money and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cOkay, so I mean we just found out today that Ozempic has something for kidney failure and that means that maybe Lily has it. Now Lilly has, I will say this, the single worst chart I have seen in a long time and there are a lot of people on Wall Street, are chartists. However, I actually like the fundamentals. Now, David Ricks did on our show, preannounce a better-than-expected quarter and nobody listened. But I do believe in Lilly, we own it for the trust, and I\u2019ve gotta tell you, I think in another dip, you get another opportunity to buy and I\u2019m sticking by that.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) focuses on discovering, developing, and marketing a wide range of human pharmaceuticals, including treatments for diabetes, oncology, autoimmune conditions, pain management, and migraines. Cramer has been a fan of LLY for a while now and recently reiterated holding on to the stock.\n\n\u201cOkay, the problem with Eli Lilly is people are saying, you know what, after a year, people are no longer taking the drugs, they\u2019re going off it, a huge percentage\u2019s going off it. I think that you own this thing because it\u2019s about cardiac\u2026 It\u2019s about high blood pressure. It\u2019s about dementia, may even be about cancer, not just about weight and diabetes. So I think you hold on to Eli Lilly. We continue to hold it for the trust. I do think there\u2019ll be good numbers, but that last quarter wasn\u2019t good. I totally understand the trepidation about the stock, but I still like it.\u201d\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer has shared his thoughts on. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Drugmakers have poured small fortunes into the development of weight loss medicines in the past few years in attempts to lead this lucrative and fast-growing market. However, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), a pioneer in the field, remains one of the leaders. That likely won't change anytime soon, since the Denmark-based pharmaceutical giant has an excellent pipeline.\n\nIn fact, Novo Nordisk recently reported positive results for one of its anti-obesity candidates that puts its current best-selling drug in this area, Wegovy, to shame. Let's look deeper into these results and what they could mean for investors.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nEarly, encouraging data\n\nNovo Nordisk's weight loss candidate in question is called amycretin. The company is developing an oral and a subcutaneous version of this medicine. Amycretin is a GLP-1 agonist, but it also mimics the action of another hormone, amylin, that regulates blood sugar and satiety. Dual agonists are proving to be especially promising candidates, and many pharmaceutical companies have created some versions.\n\nNovo Nordisk recently reported data from a phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the subcutaneous formulation of amycretin. The study enrolled 125 overweight or obese patients, with some receiving different doses of the drug, and others getting a placebo. Patients taking the highest dose of amycretin experienced a mean weight loss of 22% after 36 weeks. By contrast, those taking a placebo experienced weight gain of up to 2.3%.\n\nAmycretin's safety profile, according to Novo Nordisk, was consistent with that of medicines of the same type, with the majority of adverse reactions being mild to moderate.\n\nComparing how different medicines performed across separate clinical has severe limitations, but it can be informative. And based on the data so far, amycretin looks even more impressive than Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, the two top-selling weight loss drugs. In a 72-week study, Zepbound's mean weight loss was 20.2%, while Wegovy's was 13.7%. Amycretin did better in half the time.\n\nMultiple reasons to invest\n\nNovo Nordisk faces at least two issues in the anti-obesity space.\n\nFirst, while this market is growing fast, it isn't expanding as quickly as many anticipated. Novo Nordisk's eternal rival, Eli Lilly, recently decreased its full-year 2024 guidance again for this reason. According to Eli Lilly's management, this market grew by 45% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, slower than they had hoped.\n\nSecond, the medicine everyone thought would take over the industry, Novo Nordisk's CagriSema, did not perform as well as expected in a phase 3 study. CagriSema could still be a commercial success, though, and amycretin's recent results highlight the fact that Novo Nordisk's weight loss pipeline is deep.\n\nAnd regarding the slower-than-expected sales in the industry, Novo Nordisk's work goes beyond diabetes and obesity, which are currently its core areas. The drugmaker has been looking to diversify its lineup for years. For one, semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, is being investigated in other areas with high unmet needs. Perhaps the best example here is Alzheimer's disease, a worsening problem considering the world's aging population, but one where there are few approved medicines.\n\nFurther, Novo Nordisk has other pipeline candidates across many therapeutic areas. So, while it should remain a leader in diabetes and obesity, Novo Nordisk will also succeed in decreasing its exposure to those markets in the next five years.\n\nNVO Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nNVO Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nIn the meantime, the company continues to record excellent financial results, growing its revenue at percentages well above industry averages over the past two years. Top-line growth in the high-single-digit or low-double-digit percentages is considered strong for a drugmaker that size.\n\nLastly, the pharmaceutical giant has a solid dividend program, making it a good target for income-seeking investors. In short, Novo Nordisk is a solid long-term pick.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nAlso read:\n\n8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nSince then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly Stock Faces Mixed Fortunes Amid Rating Changes Investors observe fluctuations as analysts lower price targets and earnings fall short of expectations.\n\nShares of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) recently experienced fluctuations amid significant institutional trading and varied analyst evaluations. Following mixed reviews from Wall Street, the stock has seen some notable price changes.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 1, 2025, Eli Lilly's stock price traded down by 0.2% after StockNews.com downgraded its rating from \"buy\" to \"hold.\" The stock was reported to have traded as low as $800.11 before closing at $806.50, with 703,587 shares changing hands \u2013 reflecting a decrease of 82% from the average daily trading volume of approximately 3.99 million shares. The day before, the stock had closed at $808.17.\n\nNotably, several financial analysts have also recently revised their target prices and ratings concerning Eli Lilly. For example, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft reduced its target from $1,025.00 to $1,015.00, maintaining their \"buy\" rating. Wells Fargo lowered their target price from $1,000.00 to $970.00 and set it at \"overweight.\" Conversely, Bank of America reiterated its \"buy\" rating, issuing a target of $997.00. Overall, MarketBeat data indicates 17 analysts have assigned \"buy\" ratings, and five have issued \"hold\" ratings, giving the stock a consensus rating of \"Moderate Buy\" with an average target price set at $997.22.\n\nInvestors have closely monitored Eli Lilly, particularly after the company released its quarterly earnings results on October 30, 2024. The firm reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.18, falling short of analysts' consensus estimate of $1.52 by $0.34. Revenue for the quarter was $11.44 billion, lower than the expected $12.09 billion, though it reflected a 20.4% increase year-over-year compared to the same quarter last year, where the firm earned only $0.10 EPS. During this latest quarter, Eli Lilly demonstrated impressive operational efficiency with a return on equity of 71.08% and a net margin of 20.48%.\n\nReflecting its confidence, Eli Lilly\u2019s board of directors recently approved a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, with the payment scheduled for March 10, 2025. This dividend marks an increase from the previous $1.30 quarterly dividend and is indicative of the company\u2019s stable financial positioning and intent to reward shareholders. This results in a $6.00 annualized dividend yield amounting to 0.73%, maintained with a dividend payout ratio of 56.22%.\n\nOn top of regular dividends, Eli Lilly also announced the initiation of a stock repurchase program on December 9, 2024, allowing for the repurchase of $15.00 billion worth of shares. This plan allows the company to reacquire up to 2% of its shares through open market purchases, signaling the board's belief the stock is undervalued.\n\nDuring trading on February 1, 2025, Eli Lilly\u2019s stock traded down by 1.4%, reaching $811.61, with about 1.4 million shares exchanged. The company\u2019s current ratio remains at 1.27, quick ratio at 0.97, debt-to-equity ratio at 2.03, and it boasts a market capitalization of $770 billion. Yearly lows and highs for the stock stand at $637.00 and $972.53, respectively. Analysts anticipate Eli Lilly will post around $12.85 EPS by the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nInstitutional investor activity continues to be significant for Eli Lilly, with hedge funds holding around 82.53% of the company\u2019s stock. Recent filings show substantial volume shifts among major funds, with notable boosts and reductions across various quarters. For example, Driehaus Capital Management increased its stake by 94.2% within the second quarter, acquiring 793 additional shares to own 1,635 overall, representing about $1.48 million value.\n\nInstitutional investors like Summit Financial Strategies and CWA Asset Management Group have also altered their positions, acquiring additional shares during the last quarter.\n\nNew insider activity has also caught the eye of analysts as CAO Donald A. Zakrowski sold 900 shares on November 8, 2024. This transaction amounted to $723,042, which reflects his intent to adjust personal holdings, as it constitutes about 14.11% less than his previous stake.\n\nOverall, Eli Lilly and Company's patterns of trading and incorporation of insider actions continue to shape perceptions among investors, who watch for signals of performance. Analysts and shareholders alike remain focused on operational profitability as the pharmaceutical giant navigates the market.\n\nInvestors should remain vigilant of these dynamics, keeping watch for any shifts as Eli Lilly continues its strategic operations amid fluctuations. The company's commitment to shareholder returns, coupled with its strong revenue trajectories, positions it as one of the leading firms to watch within the industry.",

The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3.

Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

The AbbVie decision follows successful primate studies using Capsida\u2019s engineered AAV capsids, which demonstrated broad neuronal expression while avoiding liver and dorsal root ganglia targeting.\n\nCapsida\u2019s collaboration with AbbVie, forged in 2021 and focused on neurodegenerative diseases, laid the foundation for this new milestone. \u201cWe delivered on what they expected, and because we delivered on it, they\u2019re taking the program forward,\u201d Anastasiou explains, adding that \u201cit\u2019s great validation of the work we do.\u201d\n\nCapsida Biotherapeutics\u2019 initial partnership with AbbVie included an $80 million upfront payment and a $10 million equity investment. This deal later expanded into ophthalmology programs in 2023 with an additional $70 million. In January 2023, Capsida also secured a pact with Eli Lilly\u2019s subsidiary, Prevail Therapeutics, which provided $55 million upfront and the potential for up to $685 million in milestones. To date, Capsida has raised more than $265 million in total.\n\nDespite the broader ongoing biotech volatility, Capsida is rooted in an unconventional yet promising blueprint. The company\u2019s engineered capsids target the central nervous system with unprecedented precision. \u201cWe\u2019re not just using naturally occurring viruses like AAV9 that have a lot of challenges,\u201d Anastasiou says. \u201cWe\u2019re engineering the virus\u2014the capsids\u2014to address those challenges.\u201d\n\nAnastasiou says the company has \u201ca clear set of tasks ahead.\u201d It must \u201cdeliver on our INDs, get our clinical trials set up and executed, and meet our partners\u2019 expectations.\u201d While acknowledging continued uncertainty in biotech, he notes if the company hits its objectives, \u201cwe\u2019ll be fine regardless of the market environment.\u201d\n\nAnastasiou, who joined after leadership stints at Lundbeck, BMS, and Lilly, felt drawn to Capsida\u2019s vision of potentially disease-modifying therapies rather than incremental improvements. \u201cToward the last few years [at my previous company], the natural life cycle of drug development hits you,\u201d he recalls. Drawn to entrepreneurship, he said: \u201cI love and am driven by building and creating. At this stage, I wanted to do something transformative,\u201d and Capsida \u201cdefinitely has transformative potential.\u201d\n\nIn addition to bolstering its partnerships with AbbVie and Lilly, Capsida is advancing a pipeline of CNS programs\u2014from a gene therapy for STXBP1 developmental epileptic encephalopathy to another aiming to slow the progression of GBA-linked Parkinson\u2019s disease. With multiple INDs on the horizon, the company aims to prove that its tailored capsid technology, combined with strong pharma alliances, can reshape CNS treatment where conventional therapies have struggled to gain ground.\n\nCapsida\u2019s origins trace back to Caltech in 2019, when Nick Flytzanis, Ph.D. and Dr. Nick Goeden, Ph.D. unveiled an approach to engineer custom AAV capsids capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier with precision. Now, armed with a $50 million Series A from Versant Ventures and Westlake Village BioPartners, the fledgling company drew Peter Anastasiou\u2014formerly of Lundbeck, BMS, and Lilly\u2014who was motivated by the promise of \u201csomething transformative\u201d for CNS diseases. \u201cThe brain has been kind of like the last organ\u2026 we still haven\u2019t fully figured it out,\u201d Anastasiou explained. But there is clearly promise in unravelling its mysteries.",

            "content": "Donald Trump is executing a shock and awe strategy, burying the public in a smoky cloud of flamboyant proposals. Some, like ending birthright citizenship, are quickly slapped down in the courts. Some, like threatening to invade Greenland, are dismissed as moronic. But all are radical enough to provide news media with easy entertainment.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that these flashbangs distract from plans that would hit Americans, in Bill Clinton\u2019s words, \u201cwhere they live.\u201d Democrats need to focus.\n\nStart with actions to weaken Biden-era programs to restrain the prices drugmakers may charge for their products. His first day back in office, Trump canceled the Biden order to test new models for lowering drug costs.\n\nWhen Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to have Medicare negotiate drug prices. Why? It was a very popular idea. Upon election, the vow promptly vanished. Trump named Alex Azar, a top executive at Eli Lilly, to head Health and Human Services. (Under Azar, Eli Lilly tripled the price of its top-selling insulin drug.)\n\nBut Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act did follow through. As a result, 10 popular drugs covered under Medicare Part D (the prescription drug benefit) were selected for price reductions by 2026. They include such popular medications as Jardiance (diabetes), Enbrel (rheumatoid arthritis) and Eliquis (blood clots).\n\nIn its last days, the Biden administration targeted another 15 Part D drugs for price negotiations. They include Trelegy Ellipta (asthma, COPD) and three big-name drugs for weight loss, diabetes and heart disease: Rybelsus, Ozempic and Wegovy. These negotiations would have to be implemented by the Trump administration. Don\u2019t bet the farm on much relief.\n\nNovo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, has been charging Americans outlandish prices for these blockbusters. Wegovy\u2019s list price in the U.S. is over $1,300 for a month\u2019s supply. It is five times the price in Canada ($265) and 14 times the price in Britain ($92).\n\nThe right-wing argues, as Project 2025 puts it, that government negotiations on Medicare drugs amount to \u201cprice controls\u201d that will reduce patient access to new medication. That\u2019s news to the citizens of just about every other advanced country. And no, other countries don\u2019t let drugmakers charge their people whatever they want.\n\nIn Novo Nordisk\u2019s home country of Denmark, Wegovy costs only $186 a month. It should surprise no one that 72% of the company\u2019s sales come from the United States. We are the land of suckers.\n\nThanks to Biden, the catastrophic coverage tier for Part D begins when a beneficiary\u2019s out-of-pocket spending reaches $2,000. Project 2025 calls for \u201celiminating the coverage gap in Part D, reducing the government share in the catastrophic tier, and requiring manufacturers to bear a larger share.\u201d (You may laugh at the \u201crequiring manufacturers\u201d part.)\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump has yet to reverse the caps already in place on seniors\u2019 drug costs, and so beneficiaries won\u2019t notice much change right off. He\u2019s certainly too clever to mess with the $35 limit on the monthly price of insulin, one of Biden\u2019s marquee achievements. Doing so might break through the smoke.\n\nHowever, Project 2025 has its own ideas, and Trump is stocking his administration with Project 2025 folk. Furthermore, as Republicans comb through the budget for ways to pay for tax cuts, Medicare would seem a ripe place to slash spending. Trump did vow to leave Medicare alone. Then again, he vowed to have Medicare negotiate drug prices.\n\nWhy would Trump be OK with forcing Americans to pay more than the rest of the world for their drugs? The answer is simple: Because the drug companies want them to.\n\nDemocrats, step around some of those rabbit-hole distractions. You have an issue.\n\nFollow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

            "content": "EXTON, PA, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The FDA's approval of Eli Lilly\u2019s Omvoh for Crohn\u2019s disease marks a significant milestone as the therapy becomes the second IL-23 inhibitor available for patients with this challenging condition. Omvoh, already approved for ulcerative colitis, now sets its sights on carving out a niche in the Crohn\u2019s disease market. Yet, stiff competition from AbbVie\u2019s Skyrizi and an expected approval for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Tremfya raises questions about Omvoh\u2019s ability to stand out in Crohn\u2019s.\n\nSpherix Global Insights recently completed the Q4 2024 wave of its RealTime Dynamix\u2122: Crohn\u2019s Disease (US) service, engaging with 101 U.S.-based gastroenterologists to evaluate the evolving Crohn\u2019s treatment landscape. Findings from this research highlight that while Omvoh enjoys greater familiarity among physicians compared to Tremfya, it faces hurdles in key pre-launch metrics. Nearly half of gastroenterologists view Tremfya as a significant advancement over existing options, compared to just one-third who believe the same for Omvoh. Moreover, over half indicate Tremfya as their preferred IL-23 inhibitor in development for Crohn\u2019s disease, while only 20% selected Omvoh.\n\nDespite these challenges, Omvoh sits within a class that is gaining momentum, with almost half of respondents citing IL-23s as the best overall mechanism of action for Crohn\u2019s treatment. Although TNF inhibitors including adalimumab and infliximab remain the mainstay for first-line biologic treatment in Crohn\u2019s, use of Skyrizi has grown steadily since it was approved, carving out share from the TNFs and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Stelara. One gastroenterologist from the Spherix study who chose Omvoh as the preferred treatment in development note that the \u201c[The] drug seems to have the right MOA to reduce inflammation and promote remission.\u201d\n\nFor Omvoh to grow alongside its fellow IL-23s, the product will need to carve out its own unique value proposition. Omvoh\u2019s initial indication in ulcerative colitis represented Lilly\u2019s first foray into the IBD space, and the brand has grown in share slowly but steadily since launch while facing competition from manufacturers with deep roots in gastroenterology. In ulcerative colitis, Omvoh focused on addressing bowel urgency \u2013 a critical patient concern. Gastroenterologists recognize addressing urgency is equally important in Crohn\u2019s disease, with more than two-thirds agreeing that it is an important treatment goal. A gastroenterologist in the Spherix study who indicated preference for Omvoh among treatments in development noted that it can provide \u201cLasting remission and improved bowel urgency.\u201d\n\nSpherix will closely monitor Omvoh\u2019s impact on the Crohn\u2019s disease market through its RealTime Dynamix\u2122 service. In addition, Spherix will track Omvoh\u2019s performance during the first 18 months post-launch via the Launch Dynamix\u2122 service, slated to begin in February 2025. With the IL-23 class continuing to gain traction, the coming months will reveal whether Omvoh can establish a unique foothold amid fierce competition.\n\nRealTime Dynamix\u2122 is an independent service providing strategic guidance through quarterly or semiannual reports, which include market trending and a fresh infusion of event-driven and variable content with each wave.

He said it's wise to refrain from sudden moves next week as there won't be enough time to digest such a large amount of information.\n\n\"When you get a week that's packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you're usually better off sitting on your hands,\" he said. \"Because there's just too much data for any individual to process,\"\n\nPalantir is set to report Monday after close, and Cramer pointed out that the data company has been especially favored by the Pentagon as it helps companies and the government use resources more efficiently. He suggested it's likely the stock continues to climb, noting that some investors are fond of CEO Alex Karp.\n\nTuesday is packed with earnings reports. Cramer expects PayPal and Spotify to have great quarters. He noted that Spotify has a successful subscription model that usually helps top Wall Street estimates. Drug giants Merck and Pfizer will also release their numbers. Merck's could be good, he said, and if Pfizer can report positive news about its cancer dugs, that stock could run.\n\nPepsiCo and Chipotle also report on Tuesday. According to Cramer, the packaged food stocks have had a tough time since GLP-1 weight loss drugs became popular, especially PepsiCo, known for its soft drinks and snacks. He called the Mexican fast food chain a great growth stock in the restaurant sector and suggested now could be a chance to invest before shares move higher.\n\nPlus, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices have earnings are on deck Tuesday. Cramer said the Google parent's stock could rise if it reports solid growth in its cloud infrastructure business. He also wondered what AMD will have to say in the wake of breakthrough news from China's artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, which could make AMD's chips are more desirable.\n\nOn Wednesday are reports from Walt Disney , Novo Nordisk and Ford . Disney could be a buy before earnings, Cramer said, even as the fires in Los Angeles likely hurt the quarter. He said he'll be waiting to see how Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs are doing, and that Ford stock has been disappointing lately.\n\nThursday brings results from more drug stocks, Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb , as well as Amazon. Cramer said he needs more details from Eli Lilly that suggest next year will be successful, and he's optimistic about Bristol Myers's new schizophrenia drug. Cramer added that he's expecting positive earnings from Amazon, but investors might want to wait until after it reports to buy the stock.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department will release the nonfarm payroll report, an inflation metric that's important to the Federal Reserve. If the data suggests strong growth in employment and wages, it may be unlikely the central bank will cut rates in the first half of the year, Cramer said.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer cautioned viewers to not be caught up by the energy that\u2019s gripped the US stock market since President Donald Trump resumed charge. \u201cThings are happening very fast. And I want so much to slow it down,\u201d he stated. Cramer mentioned an article that mentioned \u201cthe burst of energy, some good, some bad,\u201d adding that not every remark made by the President is investment advice. He believes that \u201ca lot of people want to do that. [treat all of Trump\u2019s remarks as investable]\u201d They wanna do oil and gas, they wanna do with interest rates,\u201d he added and shared \u201cThey have to remember that he doesn\u2019t have the authority\u201d particularly when it comes to determining interest rates.\n\nCramer further commented on the state of America\u2019s non-tech industrial economy and how it tied in with the President\u2019s desire for lower rates. According to him \u201cI just think the industrial economy justifies everything that Trump wants to lower rates.\u201d Yet, as consumer spending has remained robust despite high rates, Cramer added that \u201cthe consumer economy, says don\u2019t lower rates.\u201d He believes that if the president took a look at \u201chow great things are at small to medium-sized business. Where the real strength\u2019s coming since his election,\u201d he would be hard-pressed to press for further rate cuts.\n\nEnergy was another topic on the CNBC host\u2019s mind. Commenting particularly on natural gas and its demand in today\u2019s era of AI data centers, Cramer shared \u201cPeople only want to be in this business. Want to own stocks in this business because it\u2019s going to be the biggest thing that we export.\u201d However, he believes that these investors need to ask themselves \u201cAre we going to export so much that domestically because we need it for the data centers, that the customer\u2019s going to be squeezed by uh nat gas prices.\u201d The surge in exports and data center demand could very well lead to higher natural gas prices for consumers. According to Cramer \u201cNat gas could go to five. That would be something.\u201d\n\nNot only is Cramer interested in energy, but the President ran his election on the promise of increasing America\u2019s oil production and requiring oil companies to drill more. However, the CEOs that he\u2019s spoken to \u201care all saying listen, we\u2019re going to hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Braveheart thing,\u201d Cramer added. He believes \u201cThey\u2019re not going to break. And they all are kind of united, but they don\u2019t fix prices. Some people, the FTC felt that they fixed prices. That\u2019s nonsense. But I do think that they\u2019ve all said listen we\u2019re making a ton of money. We\u2019re not going to go down the path the President wants. So there\u2019s going to be a test of wills.\u201d\n\nAnother topic that Cramer touched on was SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service. Starlink is powered by thousands of small satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) launched by SpaceX. Over the past year, it has grown its presence in the commercial aviation industry by providing airlines with internet connectivity. Cramer revealed, \u201cYou know the rap about Starlink I\u2019m getting from, the push back that I\u2019m hearing from some of the. . . that when you put em all up, like even when United starts, it\u2019s going to slow down the latency, they can\u2019t handle that.\u201d\n\nOne of the hottest topics on Wall Street these days is Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Investors\u2019 worries about the firm\u2019s R1 model being purportedly cheaper than American models led to Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stock crashing by a whopping 17% on Monday. However, Cramer dismissed the worries of US companies pouring too much money into AI on Friday. He shared that he wasn\u2019t worried \u201cbecause I\u2019m a huge believer that this is the industrial revolution, and there are going to be so many uses that you just have to be in.\u201d\n\nA mere industrial revolution isn\u2019t the only reason why Cramer was dismissive of the firm that led the AI GPU stock to lose all gains made since October 2024. Commenting on the firm\u2019s GPUs and their potential he revealed:\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re not thinking about, like when I went to Jensen Huang\u2019s panel on healthcare. It\u2019s so much bigger than anything involving AI PC. I mean they\u2019re really just talking about having the data to really attack every single disease and changing it from fatal to maintenance. You have tremendous number of people involved in trying to do that. Then you have Stripe there working with [the GPU company] to be able to do something revolutionary in finance. And then you have the banks working doing some revolutionary things trying to get people who\u2019re doing S1s. . . .\u201d\n\nCramer also believes that Fed chair Jerome Powell will be \u2018perplexed\u2019 by the amount of spending in America. According to him:\n\n\u201cThe amount of people traveling. The bump up to first class, from commercial, from the, you know what second class we\u2019ll call it, David. Uh, the amount of people just, the frequency at which people are having a dinner out. I don\u2019t know what to say, there\u2019s a burst of optimism that is being translated into spend. And particularly for younger people that I\u2019m just flabbergasted about. It just can\u2019t stop!\u201d\n\nThe spending has left him flabbergasted. \u201cWe\u2019re spending so much I don\u2019t know how they can cut!\u201d Cramer explained. \u201cI want them to cut . . . I wanted to cut like a thousand times!\u201d he added.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 24th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 106\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is the pharmaceutical giant that is at the heart of the weight loss drug market. It\u2019s also one of Cramer\u2019s favorite stocks as he has mentioned the firm multiple times on his show this year. In his recent appearance, Cramer stressed that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s scripts for its weight loss treatments were improving. He believes that scripts are key to evaluating drug companies, as other factors such as trials paint an incomplete picture. Cramer has also advised viewers to not be spooked by recent Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) share price dips. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201c[nvo new results stock down] Okay, one and a half, it\u2019s early. Remember it\u2019s a one half trial. Now, you cane make these, you can finagle Lilly versus Novo. It\u2019s hard, very hard to do actual comparisons because some are by forty eight weeks, some are shorter weeks. Some are bigger. . . what really matters? Boom, Eli Lilly\u2019s scripts are way up. And if you\u2019re looking at the fourth quarter, remember fourth quarter was a disappointment. David Ricks came on Mad Money, he came on our show. What did he say? He said we botched the launch. This is the beginning. Wolfe puts out the scripts, the numbers for Lilly were really good. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been waiting for. We can do this head to head of the phase one, the half. Forget that. Novo\u2019s down so much, anything they put out . . .and this thing causes, you know it like makes you feel better. It wouldn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Mounjaro and Zepbound weekly scripts are finally, finally doing good. And they have been not good. . . .\u201d \u201cLilly versus Novo this morning. Not one. Looked at every single data test that there is. Not one.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t compare an eighteen week to a thirty six week and there\u2019s just lots of different guess work. And I prefer, I spoke with David Ricks last week, you gotta be really careful. What really matters is scripts. And that\u2019s why, that\u2019s why Lilly is up today. It\u2019s about the scripts, not about the pill. And the scripts are now turning up after, really, a disastrous fourth quarter for Lilly. Disastrous.\u201d\n\nOverall LLY ranks 7th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about before DeepSeek wreaked havoc on the stock market. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The FDA\u2019s approval of Omvoh (mirikizumab-mrkz) for Crohn\u2019s disease\u2014its second IBD authorization since 2023\u2014establishes it as the first biologic in >15 years with Phase 3 two-year efficacy data at launch. In the pivotal VIVID-1 trial, 53% of Omvoh-treated patients achieved clinical remission at one year versus 36% on placebo*, with early endoscopic response tripling placebo rates (32% vs. 11% at three months).\n\n\u201cWe found that 53% of patients achieved clinical remission at one year,\u201d said Mark Genovese, M.D., senior vice president, Lilly Immunology Development. \u201cAmong those patients, about 90% maintained remission through the second year\u2026 It shows a durable clinical effect.\u201d\n\nThe approval follows Omvoh\u2019s 2023 ulcerative colitis clearance. Genovese emphasized Omvoh\u2019s IL-23p19 targeting as central to its durability, noting preclinical and genetic data validating the mechanism.\n\nGenovese also highlighted the broader scope of mirikizumab research, especially in pediatric populations: \u201cOmvoh is part of Lilly\u2019s broader approach to immunology. We view it as a therapy for moderate-to-severe IBD, both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s.\u201d Ongoing pediatric studies are also in the works. \u201cThese are phase 3 programs in pediatric Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis\u2014that\u2019s an important population since the disease can be devastating at a young age,\u201d Genovese added.\n\nMechanism and differentiation\n\nOmvoh selectively targets the p19 subunit of IL-23, a cytokine linked to inflammation in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. By narrowing the focus to IL-23p19 (rather than IL-23p40, which can also affect IL-12), Lilly aims to achieve robust efficacy while potentially minimizing off-target effects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for close to two decades that IL\u201123 is an important factor in inflammatory diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease.\u2026 When we block IL\u201123, we see substantial improvements in experimental colitis models,\u201d Genovese said.\n\nBeyond symptom control\n\nIn VIVID-1, early endoscopic healing (i.e., visible mucosal improvement at three months) was significantly higher among Omvoh-treated patients (32%) vs. placebo (11%). Improvements in bowel urgency, tracked with the Urgency Numeric Rating Scale (UNRS), were also notable. \u201cWe also looked at endoscopic response\u2014meaning visible healing of the intestinal lining\u2014and saw similar durability,\u201d Genovese said.\n\nThe overall safety profile appears consistent with other biologic treatments, particularly in terms of infection risk and the need to screen for tuberculosis. Mild-to-moderate elevations in liver enzymes and common side effects such as upper respiratory infections and injection site reactions were documented.\n\nPediatric trials and combination therapy potential\n\nLilly is conducting Phase 3 pediatric trials in both Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, aiming to address IBD in younger populations. The company\u2019s broader R&D strategy also includes investigating combination approaches\u2014pairing Omvoh with eltrekibart, an anti\u2013neutrophil-trafficking agent\u2014to potentially boost remission rates beyond current ceilings. \u201cWe also believe that additional benefits might require combination approaches. Even with the progress we\u2019ve made, we\u2019d like to push efficacy beyond the current ceiling,\u201d Genovese said. \u201cOur hope is that by combining two targeted therapies, we might raise the overall response rates even higher.\u201d\n\nBy 2027, Lilly anticipates additional data from ongoing pediatric trials. Combination therapy results with eltrekibart could further push remission rates higher, and the company is also eyeing global expansions, including in the EU and Japan.\n\n* Note: Approximately 40% of placebo patients in VIVID-1 crossed over to Omvoh at Week 12 due to inadequate response.",

            "content": "Obesity has long been a significant global health challenge, particularly in the western world, due to the implications it can have for associated conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.\n\nUntil recently, treatments have focused on lifestyle changes and pharmacological interventions like appetite suppressants and fat absorption inhibitors. However, these early drugs often had limited efficacy and significant side effects, leading to a persistent demand for more effective solutions.\n\nIn the last few years, a new class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown considerable success in the fight against obesity. These therapies have demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety profiles, revolutionising the anti-obesity medication (AOM) landscape.\n\nThese innovative therapies target crucial receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, effectively making patients feel less hungry. Novo Nordisk [CPH:NOVO] and Eli Lilly NYSE:LLY have led the market with Semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity) and Tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) respectively. These drugs not only improve glycaemic control but also promote substantial weight loss, offering a dual benefit for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nBoth drugs are administered via weekly injections, making them costly and onerous to deliver to patients. Furthermore, concerns are growing over the longer-term outcomes for patients after they have ceased treatment. Initially, patients tend to lose a mix of fat and muscle but, post-medication, many revert to prior habits and find that their regained weight is predominantly fat.\n\n\n\n\n\nOzempic looks set to polish its crown as the dominant force in the weight loss market, with new credentials added to its list of health benefits. It\u2019s the only GLP-1 RA to be approved by the FDA in the United States for reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This approval was based on the results of Novo Nordisk\u2019s FLOW phase 3b kidney outcomes trial so it\u2019s a big win for the company and positions them at the head of the pack.\n\nFor adults living with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems or chronic kidney disease, Ozempic has the potential to offer huge relief and cut healthcare costs, potentially reducing the need for multiple drugs.\n\nSource: Bridgewise\n\nThe above chart is a comparative analysis using AI to measure both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly against their closest peers in the market across a broad range of data sets, including PE ratio, return on equity, and dividend yield, among many other factors.\n\nMarket expectations for these treatments have been extremely high, with sustained demand growth anticipated. According to recent market analysis, the market was valued at approximately $3.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $11.3 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.9% during this period.\n\nThe future of obesity treatment looks highly promising, with the development of next generation therapies,\u201d says Alisa Craig, one of the managers of the International Biotechnology Trust. \u201cThere are currently 79 clinical stage programmes being carried out across at least 41 unique biochemical mechanisms, and these numbers continue to rise.\u201d\n\nAmong the most exciting new developments are combination therapies that activate multiple pathways, such as GLP-1 combined with gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptors, amylin, glucagon or leptin. These combinations aim to boost efficacy, improve patient outcomes and offer more comprehensive weight management solutions. Additionally, new targets such as amylin, mitochondrial uncoupling and cannabinoid-1 (CB1) reverse antagonists are being explored, promising to deliver innovative new approaches to more effective long-term obesity management.\n\n\u201cRather than backing individual treatments, we are adopting a lower risk approach by taking smaller positions across a range of the most promising assets,\u201d says Marek Poszepczynski, who also manages the International Biotechnology Trust with Craig. \u201cThis is an approach we have successfully taken over the years, in other therapeutic areas at a similar stage of maturity.\u201d\n\nInvestors should also be prepared for further merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in this part of the biotech universe. Several large pharmaceutical companies do not yet have an obesity franchise and may look to acquire exposure, given the anticipated growth and continued investor enthusiasm for this market.\n\nExisting players may also look to bolster their positions, as reflected in Novo Nordisk\u2019s acquisition of Inversago Pharma. This deal highlights the strategic importance of emerging obesity therapies that target novel mechanisms, as well as the inherent value in innovative solutions.\n\nShares in Novo Nordisk have been slumping since August and look set to drop below the SKR 550 level. But this is not reflective of the overall value of the stock. Here at The Armchair Trader we consider it to be undervalued, even before you factor in its recent FDA approvals.\n\nThe above chart shows the short term trend analysis of Novo Nordisk stock specifically, using data from Trend Intelligence. Recent share price gains for NOVO have not been sufficient to reverse negative indicators on the 12-month picture. The lowest graph shows a neutral set up. Overall this is a 75% negative trend according to this technical analysis.\n\nFor investors, the obesity drug market presents significant opportunities. The sector is poised for continued growth, driven by rising obesity rates and the increasing demand for effective treatments. The biotech industry continues to invest in innovation, with advances in drug development, novel mechanisms of action and improved delivery methods set to transform the AOM landscape in the years ahead.",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Eli Lilly (LLY) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +106.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $13.48 billion, up 44.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.48% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on factors that could lead to market growth in 2025, pointing out some key changes that could benefit investors. He expressed optimism about the shift in leadership at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department, particularly with the departure of current FTC Chief Lina Khan, whom he criticized for her harsh stance on large businesses.\n\n\u201cThe brooming of Biden's antitrust regulators as the FTC and the Justice Department, that will be fabulous, fabulous for the market.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently\n\nAccording to Cramer, Khan\u2019s approach was one of hostility toward any major business deal, regardless of the potential positive effects on the economy or on workers. He argued that with the removal of the old guard, a wave of deals could emerge that would help rationalize various industries.\n\nThis, in turn, would give smaller companies in sectors like banking, retail, entertainment, pharmaceuticals, and enterprise software a better chance to compete against larger corporations. Cramer was enthusiastic about the potential for these changes, stating, \u201cFantastic for the stock market. Just fantastic.\u201d\n\nCramer also touched on an important issue in the market: a shortage of equities. He noted that the lack of available stock could lead to higher prices. He explained that mergers and acquisitions activity could help remove some of the available stock from the market, reducing supply and potentially driving up stock prices.\n\n\u201cAlways remember the stock market is indeed a market and like any other market, when there's not enough supply, you get higher prices.\u201d\n\nMoving on to the housing market, Cramer discussed the effects of overbuilding, like in Florida, where housing prices have been impacted. He explained that when mortgage rates rise, housing prices tend to drop. This price drop often leads to a wait-and-see approach from buyers, who hold out for even lower prices. As sellers grow more desperate, they typically lower prices further in a bid to move their properties.",

The termination notice also referenced a similarly discontinued \u201crelated heart failure study that demonstrated no benefit in an overlapping patient group.\u201d It remains unclear what cardiovascular study this is, though another Phase II trial of the candidate in chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains tagged as active but is not recruiting.\n\nBioSpace has reached out to Eli Lilly for clarification and will update this space as appropriate.\n\nVolenrelaxin is a synthetic analog of the human relaxin protein that activates the relaxin receptor. Animal studies of the molecule showed that volenrelaxin can elicit relaxin-related pharmacological response, including greater renal blood flow in rats.\n\nA Phase I trial found volenrelaxin to be safe and suitable for subcutaneous dosing, and identified promising signals of efficacy. The synthetic hormone resulted in \u201csustained improvement in kidney perfusion upon repeated dosing,\u201d according to the study, supporting its further clinical development in chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure.\n\nLilly is scheduled to hold its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call on Feb. 6.\n\nThe pharma\u2019s decision to cut volenrelaxin\u2019s mid-stage CKD study has also affected Massachusetts-based Tectonic Therapeutics, whose stock price tanked as much as 40% on Tuesday after the news broke.\n\nTectonic is advancing TX45, a relaxin fusion molecule that activates the RXFP1 receptor, not unlike volenrelaxin. The biotech is proposing TX45 as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension in the presence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\nIn a flash note on Tuesday, analysts at Leerink Partners noted that Lilly\u2019s decision to terminate the volenrelaxin study \u201chas caused significant concern about the likelihood of success of TX45.\u201d In a separate follow-up note, however, the Leerink analysts reiterated their confidence in Tectonic, pointing to several key differences between TX45 and volenrelaxin.\n\nTX45, for instance, uses a different relaxin approach than Lilly\u2019s candidate, and is being tested for different indications, according to the Leerink note. Tectonic is also targeting distinct endpoints from Lilly. Tectonic is building toward a Phase Ib readout in the first quarter of 2025.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.",

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, to pledge that the new administration won't give in to the pharmaceutical industry's attacks on a popular Medicare drug price negotiation program that has already yielded significant results.\n\nSanders raised the matter during Kennedy's confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which the Vermont senator serves as the ranking member.\n\n\n\n\"Will you defend the law in the Inflation Reduction Act which already is negotiating prescription drug prices?\" Sanders asked, referring to the Biden-era measure that empowered Medicare to negotiate the prices of a select number of prescription drugs directly with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nDeclining to provide a yes or no answer to Sanders' question, Kennedy replied that \"President Trump wants us to negotiate drug prices\" and added that, if confirmed as Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, he would \"comply with the laws.\"\n\nWatch:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exchange came after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within HHS, issued a statement Wednesday declaring that \"lowering the cost of prescription drugs for Americans is a top priority of President Trump and his administration\" and expressing commitment to \"incorporating lessons learned to date from the [Inflation Reduction Act] program and to considering opportunities to bring greater transparency in the negotiation program.\"\n\n\"CMS intends to provide opportunities for stakeholders to provide specific ideas to improve the negotiation program, consistent with the goals of achieving greater value for beneficiaries and taxpayers and continuing to foster innovation,\" the agency added.\n\nWhile some advocates for lower drug prices cautiously welcomed the CMS statement, Senate Democrats warned Thursday that its choice of language \"appeared to open the door to Big Pharma's requests.\"\n\n\"If confirmed as secretary, you will be under tremendous pressure to cave to Big Pharma and undermine Medicare drug price negotiation Republicans have worked in lock-step with Big Pharma by relentlessly attacking Medicare drug price negotiation at every turn,\" a group of 12 Senate Democrats and Sanders wrote in a letter to Kennedy. \"Now, Republicans have unified control of the federal government. They will undoubtedly try to leverage this power to walk back the progress Democrats made to lower drug prices through this important new authority.\"\n\nThe letter pushes Kennedy to answer a number of questions related to the drug price negotiation program, including whether he would recommend that the Trump administration defend the program from the pharmaceutical industry's ongoing legal assault.\n\n\"On behalf of the tens of millions of Americans who count on Medicare,\" the new letter states, \"Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee want to know whether the Trump administration will follow through on negotiating with Big Pharma to deliver the lower costs promised to the American people.\"\n\nAfter Trump announced his intent to nominate Kennedy as HHS chief late last year, the pharmaceutical lobby made clear its plan to push the new administration to undercut the price negotiation program that is poised to deliver billions of dollars in savings by bringing down the prices of expensive and widely used medications.\n\nEarlier this month, the CEO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly said his company and other drugmakers would ask the Trump administration to pause the price-negotiation program, claiming that \"they need to fix it\" before proceeding to talks over the next slate of 15 drugs selected in the final days of the Biden administration.\n\nIn their letter on Thursday, the senators demanded that Kennedy \"confirm in writing\" that he \"will follow the law and reject\n\nBig Pharma's request to pause Medicare drug price negotiation.\"",

            "content": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced a groundbreaking settlement with insulin manufacturer Novo Nordisk, ensuring that all Minnesotans can access their insulin products for no more than $35 per month for the next five years. The settlement resolves a 2018 lawsuit that alleged Novo Nordisk deceptively priced its insulin products, creating sky-high costs for uninsured and underinsured Minnesotans who relied on this life-saving medication.\n\nThis historic agreement follows earlier settlements in 2024 with Eli Lilly and Sanofi, the other two defendants in the lawsuit. With this final resolution, Minnesotans can now purchase insulin from any of the three largest insulin manufacturers for just $35 per month\u2014regardless of whether they have insurance. The Attorney General\u2019s Office has also launched MNInsulin35.org to help Minnesotans navigate these new options for low-cost and free insulin.\n\nCredit: AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli\n\nKey Provisions of the Settlement with Novo Nordisk:\n\n$35 Monthly Cap: For the next five years, Minnesotans can purchase Novo Nordisk insulin products\u2014including Novolog, Tresiba, Fiasp, and Novolin\u2014at $35 per month per prescription (up to 3 vials or 2 packs of pens). This price is available for those paying cash, with or without insurance.\n\nFor the next five years, Minnesotans can purchase Novo Nordisk insulin products\u2014including Novolog, Tresiba, Fiasp, and Novolin\u2014at $35 per month per prescription (up to 3 vials or 2 packs of pens). This price is available for those paying cash, with or without insurance. Free Insulin for Low-Income Minnesotans: Novo Nordisk will continue its Patient Assistance Program, which provides free insulin to Minnesotans with household incomes up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($124,800 annually for a family of four).\n\nNovo Nordisk will continue its Patient Assistance Program, which provides free insulin to Minnesotans with household incomes up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($124,800 annually for a family of four). Patient Choice: Insured Minnesotans can choose to pay the $35 cash price instead of using their insurance if it offers a better deal.\n\nInsured Minnesotans can choose to pay the $35 cash price instead of using their insurance if it offers a better deal. Texting Support System: Novo Nordisk will implement a texting system to help patients and pharmacists determine eligibility for low-cost insulin, ensuring patients are informed about their options at pharmacy counters across the state.\n\n\u201cOur litigation has had a huge impact on insulin prices,\u201d Attorney General Ellison said. \u201cIn 2018, when we filed this lawsuit, it could cost hundreds of dollars for Minnesotans to fill their insulin prescriptions. As of today, it will cost just $35. My mission as Attorney General is to help Minnesotans afford their lives, and this settlement is a major step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nImpact on Minnesota and Beyond\n\nThis settlement addresses years of public outrage over the skyrocketing cost of insulin, which is critical for managing diabetes. Minnesota has been at the forefront of this fight, with state legislative efforts such as the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act, named after a young man who tragically died after rationing his insulin due to its cost.\n\nThe agreement with Novo Nordisk aligns with President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which capped insulin costs at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare. Now, thanks to this settlement, Minnesotans of all ages and income levels can benefit from this same price cap.\n\nNext Steps for Minnesotans\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office is committed to raising public awareness about these new options. In the coming months, the Office will work with state, local, and community partners to ensure that all Minnesotans know how to access affordable insulin. The website MNInsulin35.org provides detailed information on how to purchase insulin for $35 or obtain it for free based on income eligibility.\n\nAdditionally, the settlement underscores Novo Nordisk\u2019s commitment to supporting Minnesotans who rely on insulin. By keeping prices affordable and implementing tools to improve access, the agreement ensures that everyone, regardless of insurance coverage or financial status, can manage their diabetes without fear of financial ruin.\n\nBackground on Insulin Pricing and Legal Efforts\n\nOver the past decade, insulin manufacturers and pharmacy benefits managers have faced growing scrutiny from state attorneys general and Congress over the rising cost of insulin. Insulin, first discovered over 100 years ago, has seen its prices skyrocket despite minimal changes to its manufacturing process.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office has led the charge against these pricing practices, filing lawsuits in 2018 against Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and Sanofi. These lawsuits exposed how list prices, known as the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, were set deceptively high, leaving uninsured and underinsured patients to bear the brunt of the costs.\n\nIn addition to securing these settlements, Attorney General Ellison and his team have vigorously defended other legislative measures designed to combat high drug prices. This includes the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act and price-gouging laws aimed at curbing the excessive costs of generic drugs.\n\n\u201cWhile our insulin lawsuits have been resolved, my Office\u2019s work to make life more affordable for Minnesotans is far from over,\u201d Ellison emphasized.\n\nHow to Get Help\n\nMinnesotans struggling to afford their insulin or who have complaints about pricing are encouraged to reach out to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Consumers can contact the Office online, by phone at (651) 296-3353 or (800) 657-3787, or through the Minnesota Relay at (800) 627-3529.\n\nThis final settlement with Novo Nordisk is a major victory for all Minnesotans, ensuring that no one has to choose between their health and their finances.",

Email\n\nThis story highlights one of the many ways Purdue teams up with corporate partners to create solutions for complex global challenges. Learn how your organization can collaborate with us.\n\nCelebrating the history and future of a transformative collaboration built on Indiana soil\n\nHistory has shown that when Purdue University and Eli Lilly and Company join forces, lives are transformed.\n\nTogether, these Indiana institutions are driving critical breakthroughs in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research, tackling some of the most complex challenges in modern health care and preparing the next generation of industry innovators.\n\nToday\u2019s efforts are built on a partnership that spans more than a century, united by a shared mission to build a better world.\n\nWith a focus on real-world applications, Purdue researchers collaborate with Lilly scientists to develop next-generation drug products designed for scalable manufacturing. (Purdue University photo/Rebecca Robi\u00f1os)\n\nA legacy of collaboration\n\nIn 1854 Eli Lilly, future founder of the company that shares his name, began an apprenticeship at the Good Samaritan Drug Store on Main Street in downtown Lafayette. Just 20 years later, Purdue welcomed its first class of students a few miles across the river. Two years after that, Lilly founded his company in a small building on Pearl Street in Indianapolis.\n\nBoth organizations sprang up during a transformative era in U.S. history, growing alongside a nation brimming with ambition and innovation, each striving to shape lives in ways that still resonate today. Early on, both organizations recognized that the other would be a critical partner in their shared pursuit of a better, healthier world.\n\nLilly scientists and Purdue faculty and students have a tremendous opportunity to turn bold ideas into game-changing medicines, giving more people around the world a chance at better health. Dave Ricks BS industrial management \u201990\n\nIn 1886, Eli Lilly and Company hired its very first chemist, Ernest Eberhardt \u2014 Purdue\u2019s top graduate from the then-new School of Pharmacy \u2014 to lead the company\u2019s first research program. Eberhardt helped shape the early days of drug discovery at Lilly, opening the doors for countless Purdue students to learn, grow and work at the company, including current Eli Lilly and Company CEO Dave Ricks (BS industrial management \u201990).\n\n\u201cAs a Purdue graduate, I am proud of the university\u2019s success and even more proud to see how the partnership between Lilly and Purdue strengthens both institutions,\u201d Ricks says.\n\nContinuing the momentum\n\nIn 2017, Purdue and Lilly entered a strategic collaboration to accelerate the discovery and development of new medicines. Today, over 50 researchers and more than 60 graduate students collaborate with Lilly scientists in the Eli Lilly and Company and Purdue University Research Alliance Center (LPRC). Current focus areas for the LPRC include:\n\ngenetic medicine \u2014 using our own biologic building blocks to unlock new pathways to treatment and potentially cures\n\nintrathecal drug delivery \u2014 delivering medications directly into the spinal fluid to treat central nervous system conditions\n\nnanoparticle drug delivery \u2014 using microscopic particles to improve the delivery and effectiveness of drugs in the body\n\nKurt Ristroph and his lab work within the LPRC on developing nanomaterials and nanoparticle formulations \u2014 extremely small carriers that move medicine throughout the body (about 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair). Ristroph and his team of 20 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students are especially focused on scalability and manufacturability in nanoparticle development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to develop reproducible large-scale manufacturing techniques for these nanoparticle formulations for a lot of different drugs, for a lot of different diseases and for a lot of different routes of administration,\u201d Ristroph says.\n\nThis focus on real-world application allows researchers like Ristroph and scientists at Lilly to create next-generation drug products that can be manufactured at scale. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes Lilly a great partner for my group, because the work is so industry-oriented,\u201d Ristroph says.\n\nLilly has also collaborated with Purdue to build out tomorrow\u2019s workforce in drug development. The Lilly Scholars at Purdue program is supported by a $42.5 million investment that awards up to 100 scholarships each year for talented undergraduate students who are interested in driving innovation in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing.\n\nCompanies like Lilly can help researchers define the scope for real-world hard problems. If we come up with a solution for a properly defined problem, that maximizes the chance that it can be translated by the company into a product that helps the patient. Kurt Ristroph Assistant professor of agricultural and biological engineering, chemical engineering (by courtesy)\n\nThese Lilly Scholars have the unique opportunity to complete a paid Lilly internship, participate in coursework on pharmaceutical careers and engage with Lilly leaders for networking, mentoring and professional development.\n\n\u201cThis partnership for talent development is essential for Lilly as we embark on unprecedented growth that requires expertly trained professionals,\u201d Ricks says.\n\nPurdue, Lilly and pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc. recently collaborated to announce the launch of the \u2060Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium. The consortium is a collaborative effort to pioneer advances in making medicines with a focus on developing manufacturing technologies that will ensure quality, safety and compliance.\n\nMaking life better for millions around the world\n\nBoth Purdue and Lilly recognize that collaboration between academia and industry is essential for turning research into real-world impact that contributes to the evolution of medical science.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways giant leaps happen is when research gets translated. Companies like Lilly are the ones that do that translation,\u201d Ristroph says. \u201cMy academic research can be as industry-oriented as I want, but unless a company picks it up and runs with it and is willing to take a risk on it, at the end of the day, the work we do isn\u2019t going to help patients.\u201d\n\nPurdue\u2019s strengths in both pharmacy and engineering, along with support from Lilly, uniquely position the collaboration to support every phase of drug development \u2014 from the discovery of a molecule to the creation of effective formulations that turn that molecule into medicine and finally to the development of methods to manufacture and deliver the drug at scale.\n\nTogether with Lilly, Purdue researchers are turning groundbreaking research into real-world advancements in medical science.

If we come up with a solution for a properly defined problem, that maximizes the chance that it can be translated by the company into a product that helps the patient,\u201d Ristroph says. \u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for giant leaps, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\nBy continuing to pursue collaborative research, scientific expertise in biology, pharmaceuticals and engineering, Purdue and Lilly hope to make life better for millions more people around the world.\n\n\u201cTogether we\u2019ve helped turn scientific discoveries into practical, lifesaving therapies,\u201d Ricks says. \u201cWith demand for our groundbreaking medicines continuing to grow, we\u2019re forging ahead to advance scientific research and attract top talent here in Indiana.\n\n\u201cLilly scientists and Purdue faculty and students have a tremendous opportunity to turn bold ideas into game-changing medicines, giving more people around the world a chance at better health,\u201d Ricks says.",

DeepSeek update: The S & P 500 is higher Tuesday, but once again the tape is heavily bifurcated. On one side there is strength in megacap techs with names like Meta Platforms , Amazon and Apple building on Monday's gains as these Club names are perceived to be winners from DeepSeek's low-cost large language model. The rally in software stocks including Club holding Salesforce accelerated under the premise that the \"commoditization of AI\" will increase adoption and the real value is in the data. Salesforce, of course, has tons of customer data that it could leverage to make compelling AI offerings. On Tuesday night, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff will be on \"Mad Money\" with Jim Cramer to explain the case. Then there are rebounds happening in stocks that were pummeled Monday on the DeepSeek emergence, though the degree of the recovery is significantly varied. For example, portfolio stock Nvidia is clawing back losses with a strong 6% gain, but the rebound in custom AI chip stocks Broadcom , a Club name, and Marvell Technology was more tepid. AMD was nonexistent, down roughly 0.7%. Technology winners and losers are starting to come into the picture, but there are still a ton of questions and very few answers as to what this means for the pace of industrial capital expenditures. It's a mixed bag for stocks that benefit from AI capex and the associated need for more power infrastructure. GE Vernova is higher, and Vertiv is fighting to stay positive. Meanwhile, Club name Eaton climbed into the green a little after 2 p.m. ET after spending most of the session in the red; at its lows, the stock was down more than 3%. Earlier Tuesday, we held our nose and bought the weakness in Eaton. The upcoming earnings calls from Meta Platforms and Microsoft on Wednesday night will be important sentiment drivers. Rest of market : But on the non-AI side, the rest of the market is dealing with some soggy action due to the uptick in the 10-year Treasury yield, refreshed concerns about President Donald Trump's tariff pledges, and general market rotation the opposite way after a good rally on Monday. Overbought conditions could be a factor, with the S & P Short Range Oscillator exceeding 7% after Monday's action. The S & P Oscillator is Jim's longtime trusted momentum indicator, and overbought readings \u2014 anything above 4% \u2014 suggest that a pullback or consolidation could be in order. The Oscillator helped motivate our trim of Danaher earlier Tuesday. Health checkup: The recent health-care rally is taking a bit of a breather. Within our portfolio, the only industry player higher is Eli Lilly , which added about 0.3%. The small advance comes after the stock on Monday closed above $800 a share for the first time since early December. Lilly is on track for its sixth straight positive day. On Tuesday afternoon, Lilly rival Novo Nordisk's type-2 diabetes treatment Ozempic secured expanded use authorization from U.S. regulators to also include chronic kidney disease . It's yet another piece of evidence showing that GLP-1 drugs \u2014 a market currently dominated by Lilly and Novo \u2014 can offer wide-ranging health benefits beyond improve blood sugar control and weight loss. Up next: After the closing bell Tuesday, we'll see earnings from Starbucks and Nextracker . For Starbucks, the results will likely be awful but what matters more are signs of green shoots in CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan. For Nextracker, we'll be looking for commentary on its project backlog and conversion, as well as any commentary on the state of the solar market under the Trump administration. Other companies reporting are Stryker , Chubb , Logitech and Packaging Corp. of America . Danaher is set to report before the opening bell Wednesday. Since the life-sciences firm already preannounced positive results at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month, the market will be more focused on guidance. Other companies reporting Wednesday include ASML , T-Mobile , ADP , General Dynamics , MSCI , Nasdaq , Norfolk Southern, and Otis.

            "content": "Growing demand for weight-loss solutions has catapulted pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly LLY and Novo Nordisk NVO into the spotlight, with their drugs Ozempic, Mounjaro, Zepbound and Wegovy, becoming household names.\n\nA lesser-known player, Allurion Technologies AALUR, is carving a niche with its innovative solutions. The Massachusetts-based medical technology firm plans to test its gastric balloon-based Allurion Program alongside GLP-1 agonists, aiming to enhance muscle retention during weight loss.\n\nFollowing this announcement, its stock more than doubled on Jan. 24, signaling market optimism that its approach could challenge industry giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, ushering in a new contender in the weight-loss arena. Despite this meteoric rise, analysts project a triple-digit upside, making this under-the-radar stock worth exploring further.\n\nAbout Allurion Stock\n\nAllurion Technologies AALUR aims to end obesity through innovation. Its flagship Allurion Program features a swallowable, procedure-free intragastric balloon designed to aid weight loss. Coupled with AI-powered remote monitoring, a behavior change program, secure messaging, and telehealth via the Allurion Virtual Care Suite, the company offers a comprehensive weight-loss solution. Though modestly valued at $17.75 million, Allurion\u2019s tech-driven approach paints a picture of MedTech disrupting traditional methods and reshaping lives.\n\nALUR stock has tumbled 93% over the past 52 weeks, hitting rock bottom at $2.37 on Jan. 17. But just days later, shares of Allurion staged an incredible comeback, soaring 133.8% in five days, and over 134% on Jan. 24 alone, driven by the announcement to combine its weight-loss technology with an obesity drug, a move that reignited investor optimism and nearly doubled the stock overnight.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, ALUR stock is priced at 0.41 times sales, significantly cheaper than its sector rivals.\n\nAllurion Dips Despite Q3 Earnings Beat\n\nAllurion Technologies\u2019 Q3 earnings on Nov. 13 showed mixed results. Revenue plunged 70.5% year over year to $5.4 million, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The decline stemmed from de-stocking, macroeconomic pressures, a temporary sales suspension in France due to a product recall, and tighter credit risk management. Unsurprisingly, the stock took a hit, tumbling 26.3% post-earnings and another 37% in the subsequent two trading sessions.\n\nYet, amid these hurdles, glimmers of resilience emerged. AI product revenue from the Virtual Care Suite (VCS) soared 82% as U.S. patients began pairing Allurion\u2019s solutions with GLP-1 therapies. Procedure volumes rebounded strongly in regions like the Middle East and Latin America, where macro headwinds had eased.\n\nLosses also narrowed significantly. The net loss shrank to $9 million or $0.14 per share) from $21.6 million or $0.54 per share a year earlier, surpassing analyst estimates marginally. Operational losses improved, too, dropping from $26.2 million in the year-ago quarter to $12.3 million, aided by reduced bad debts and cost-cutting measures.\n\nManagement expressed optimism about resuming sales in France following a successful remediation plan. Meanwhile, plans to expand their AI portfolio, including testing Coach Iris, its AI coach, promise future growth.\n\nAlongside the challenges of falling revenue, the company updated its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to a range between $30 million and $35 million, closely aligning with analyst expectations of $32.07 million. Despite flat year-over-year procedure volume growth, Allurion\u2019s leadership is planning to slash operating expenses by 50% in 2025.\n\nLosses, which have long shadowed the company, are expected to narrow significantly. Analysts forecast a dramatic 84.4% year-over-year reduction in losses to $10.09 per share in fiscal 2024, followed by a further 27.1% improvement to $7.36 per share loss in 2025.\n\nGame-Changing Weight Loss Tech\n\nAllurion Technologies sent ripples through the weight-loss market last week, driven by an announcement that could redefine obesity care. The company plans to test its innovative gastric balloon technology alongside GLP-1 drugs, a groundbreaking approach that has the potential to outshine industry giants like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nAllurion\u2019s gastric balloon, a swallowable device that inflates to restrict stomach capacity, has already shown promise. Unlike GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones to boost satiety but often lead to muscle loss, the Allurion Balloon has achieved remarkable results. Studies reveal patients losing up to 15.7% of their weight without sacrificing muscle mass, and in some cases, even gaining lean body mass. Now, Allurion aims to amplify these benefits by combining its technology with GLP-1 therapies like Wegovy and Zepbound.\n\nCEO Dr. Shantanu Gaur calls this combination a potential \u201cgold standard\u201d in obesity care. The company\u2019s forthcoming study will evaluate whether this regimen can help patients not only shed pounds but also improve overall body composition, addressing a critical gap left by other weight-loss methods.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Allurion Stock?\n\nDespite ALUR\u2019s struggles, analysts remain bullish on the weight-loss stock, with ALUR having a \"Strong Buy\" rating overall. With four analysts tracking it, three recommend a \"Strong Buy\" while one stays cautious with a \"Hold.\" This consensus points to optimism, hinting that the company\u2019s potential might soon outweigh its current underperformance.\n\nThe average price target of $28.67 suggests an additional upside potential of about 427% from current prices. However, the Street-high target of $50 implies the MedTech stock could rally as much as 820%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Lilly is tirzepatide\u2019s patentholder and the manufacturer of the two branded versions of tirzepatide, Mounjaro\u00ae (for diabetes) and Zepbound\u00ae (for weight loss and, announced on December 20, On December 19, 2024, FDA formally announced the end of the tirzepatide shortage in a Declaratory Order issued to Eli Lilly & Co. (\u201c\u201d). Lilly is tirzepatide\u2019s patentholder and the manufacturer of the two branded versions of tirzepatide, Mounjaro\u00ae (for diabetes) and Zepbound\u00ae (for weight loss and, announced on December 20, sleep apnea ).\n\nFDA\u2019s December 19 announcement ended a regulatory back and forth that I previously summarized here. In short, on October 2, 2024, FDA announced that Lilly had resolved the tirzepatide shortage, but five days later the Outsourcing Facilities Association (\u201cOFA\u201d) sued FDA on the grounds that FDA\u2019s decision to end the tirzepatide shortage was unlawful because, inter alia, FDA failed to provide notice and seek comments from interested stakeholders. Just over a week later, FDA paused the end of the shortage and announced that it was reconsidering its position and promised to publish an updated final decision shortly. That final decision came on December 19, and today tirzepatide is no longer on FDA\u2019s list of shortage drugs.\n\nFDA\u2019s resolution of the tirzepatide shortage dramatically changes how the law applies to companies making and distributing compounded copies. Please read below for some of the frequently asked questions (\u201cFAQs\u201d) I have received since FDA issued its Declaratory Order:\n\n1. Q. What is the state of the law for companies still making and selling compounded tirzepatide?\n\nA. When tirzepatide was on FDA\u2019s list of shortage drugs, federal law allowed for the compounding of \u201ccopies\u201d pursuant to 21 USC \u00a7 353a (for compound pharmacies) and 353b (for outsourcing facilities). However, those protections dissipated once tirzepatide was removed from the shortage list, so compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities can be held in violation of the law to the extent they still compound copies. FDA can deem compounded tirzepatide to be in violation of the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the FDCA, and Lilly can sue them under the Lanham Act for violating Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide patent.\n\n2. Q. Can I sell the rest of my inventory of compounded tirzepatide?\n\nA. In its Declaratory Statement, FDA explained that it will abstain from taking action against compound pharmacies so long as they discontinue making and distributing compounded tirzepatide before February 18, 2025. Outsourcing facilities have an extra 30 days, or until March 19, 2025. However, FDA exercising its \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d during this wind down period may not not prevent Lilly from initiating its own Lanham Act cases, so in practical terms the off-ramp from compounded tirzepatide might be shorter than what FDA has established for itself.\n\n3. Q. I market compounded tirzepatide to patients, but I am not the compounder. Does this change in the status of tirzepatide impact me?\n\nA. Yes. FDA\u2019s Declaratory Statement makes clear that, once the deadlines expire, it can take action against companies \u201ccompounding, distributing, or dispensing\u201d compounded tirzepatide. For its part, Lilly would likely be able to bring Lanham Act cases against a similarly broad array of actors.\n\n4. Q. What about patients?\n\nA. The best interests of patients should not be disregarded in this discussion. If, for instance, your company has been prescribing compounded tirzepatide to patients during the shortage period, those patients should be advised about the inevitable discontinuation as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition. Unfortunately, many patients may choose to forego additional treatments due to the dramatic increase in cost associated with brand name versus compounded GLP-1 drugs.\n\n5. Q. Are any GLP-1s still on FDA\u2019s shortage list?\n\nA. Yes. As of the date of this post, semaglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide remain on FDA\u2019s shortage list \u2013 so compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities can still make and dispense compounded copies. Novo Nordisk and Lilly have told FDA that these GLP-1 drugs are \u201cavailable\u201d, but FDA has yet to publicly verify this information. However, it can at any time. In its Declaratory Statement, FDA made clear that it can remove drugs from the shortage list without notice to stakeholders, so companies making compounded copies must be nimble and have backup plans.\n\n6. Q. If I issue a three or six month prescription to a patient for compounded tirzepatide, will the patient still be able to get the prescription filled after the deadline?\n\nA. Probably not. Even assuming a practitioner could prescribe tirzepatide for an extended time period, compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities are still restricted by the removal of tirzepatide from FDA\u2019s shortage list and would continue to face legal consequences for making and dispensing compounded copies.\n\n7. Q. What if a patient needs compounded tirzepatide due to a unique medical need?\n\nA. Traditional compounding involves the preparation of medications that are not commercially available, for instance for patients allergic to certain ingredients in approved, mass-produced drugs. Traditional compounding is still commonplace today, see \u00a7 353a, and theoretically a patient could be allergic to an ingredient in Zepbound\u00ae and require compounded tirzepatide instead. However, if this occurred at an industrial scale, it could draw the ire of FDA or Lilly as an end-around to the rules prohibiting the compounding of \u201ccopies\u201d of commercially available drugs.\n\nUltimately, whether the traditional compounding of tirzepatide could survive a challenge by FDA or Lilly would be fact dependent. The law prohibits compounding pharmacies from compounding \u201cregularly or in inordinate amounts any drug products that are essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.\u201d \u00a7 353(b)(1)(D). So, at the threshold, the pharmacy would need to establish that i) it does not compound tirzepatide regularly or in inordinate amounts, and ii) its compounded tirzepatide is not merely a copy of Zepbound\u00ae or Mounjaro\u00ae.\n\nIn a 2018 guidance, FDA explained that it would consider a compounded drug to be essentially a copy of a commercially available drug if it has (i) the same API, (ii) the same or similar dosage, and (iii) the same route of administration, unless \u201ca prescriber determines that there is a change, made for an identified individual patient, which produces, for that patient, a significant difference from the commercially available drug product.\u201d The guidance also explains that, if a change is made for an identified patient, the prescriber should document the determination on the prescription, and the notations should be specific. Of course, in a footnote to the guidance, FDA explained that it retains the authority to determine that the \u201csignificant difference\u201d is merely a \u201cpretext\u201d for the compounding of copies of commercially available products, in which instance it could bring an enforcement action.\n\n8. Q. How was FDA able to remove tirzepatide from the shortage list without notifying the public and requesting comments? Can this happen again to other shortage drugs?\n\nA. In its Declaratory Order, FDA cited a list of reasons why it was able to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list without providing the public with notice and the opportunity to submit comments. Among other reasons, FDA explained that the law did not require notice and comment, providing notice would require the publication of the manufacturer\u2019s trade secrets, and notice could lead to hoarding. Yes, this can happen again.\n\n9. Q. Is there any chance that tirzepatide will return to the shortage list?\n\nA. OFA has sued FDA based on FDA\u2019s removal of tirzepatide from the shortage list, and that case is ongoing. More recently, Lilly has asked for permission to intervene. Regardless of whether Lilly joins the fray, OFA has an uphill battle in court. The Trump administration may wish to look into the issue, but it is not on any list of initial priorities.\n\n10. Q. My tirzepatide is labeled \u201cfor research use only.\u201d I should be in the clear, right?\n\nA. No. For more insight on \u201cresearch use only\u201d GLP-1s, please see my prior article here.",

            "content": "On an investment spree with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of projects ongoing globally, Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Company chose Kenosha County for its latest \u2013 and one of its largest \u2013investments, prompting hopes for a myriad of \u201cwaterfall effects\u201d to the local economy, local officials say. Plans for a sterile injectables manufacturing complex \u2013 first unveiled by Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Nexus Pharmaceuticals in 2019 with a price tag of $250 million \u2013 set the stage for Lilly to move into Kenosha County with a $3 billion investment. Nexus had originally planned to spend more than a decade building several additions at its Pleasant Prairie campus, starting with a $100 million, 100,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, constructed in 2021 at 10300 128th Ave. in the Prairie Highlands Corporate Park. Last April, however, Lilly acquired the facility for nearly $1 billion and then announced in December plans to spend $3 billion to expand it. The expansion project is expected to create 750 new jobs, including operators, technicians, engineers and scientists who will be hired to run the expanded manufacturing facility. The project is the company\u2019s largest U.S. manufacturing investment outside of its home state and will join $23 billion in manufacturing expansions Lilly has begun since 2020.Lilly\u2019s Pleastant Prairie facility will primarily be producing two of its blockbuster drugs: Mounjaro, a treatment for type 2 diabetes, and Zepbound, an anti-obesity medication \u2013 both of which have exploded in demand over the past year, making it difficult for the company to keep up with demand. \u201cWe\u2019ll use digital automation to help us improve speed and efficiency. This will really be a cutting-edge, high-tech manufacturing site,\u201d said Lilly chief executive officer David Ricks. \u201cLilly is focused on innovation, which meshes well with that of Wisconsin, including the state\u2019s emphasis on personalized medicine, biohealth technology and precision technology, precision manufacturing and automation. This marriage hopefully will produce a great outcome, both for our company and (Wisconsin).\u201d With an already-built and FDA-approved site, Lilly is anticipating a shorter timeline to production than building a facility on an undeveloped site would allow. Ricks said the aspects of the deal that drew Lilly to Pleasant Prairie were the speed at which permits can be completed, access to the site during construction and available workforce. \u201cSpeed for us is a critical factor in delivering a new production space,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the logistics of getting people on-site to construct this facility, permitting, collaboration from the local to the state level to enable our project.\u201d Further, Ricks said the availability of vacant land surrounding the 128th Avenue site was also a draw. Already, Lilly has purchased a 324,000-square-foot industrial building in the Village of Bristol for $40.8 million, near the former Nexus Pharmaceuticals building, and an additional 31 acres of vacant land surrounding that building for $10.2 million, creating a 53.5-acre site straddling the border of Pleasant Prairie and Bristol. Officials at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. have declined to release details on any tax credits Lilly could receive as part of an incentive package, stating that sharing those records related to \u201cpending or potential opportunities\u201d could impede economic development in the state. Lilly has formally proposed two different expansion projects so far, according to documents submitted to the Pleasant Prairie Plan Commission. The first is a 14,098-square-foot addition to the north of the existing building. The second is a 49,221-square-foot, three-story addition on the west side of the building. The addition to the west will mainly be used as office space while the addition to the north will be additional warehouse space. Both additions are expected to be completed by March 2026. With the acquisition of the Pleasant Prairie and Bristol buildings, the planned Pleasant Prairie expansion and the land purchases, the company said its total planned investment in Wisconsin is $4 billion. [caption id=\"attachment_605480\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"]A rendering of Eli Lilly\u2019s expanded facility.[/caption]Local and state officials praised Lilly following the announcement, saying the company\u2019s presence could bring a \u201cwaterfall effect\u201d to the area. \u201cLilly\u2019s incredible investment here is a watershed moment for Kenosha County,\u201d said Nicole Ryf, president of the Kenosha Area Business Alliance. \u201cTo have one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world choose to expand its manufacturing operations in our community is thrilling and speaks to the hard work our leadership has done across all levels to make Kenosha County a premier destination for new investment in the Milwaukee-Chicago corridor.\u201d Ricks said Lilly plans to work with community, technical colleges and other universities to help train the workforce for future job openings, many of which will require two- or four-year degrees. \u201cGateway Technical College is excited to support Lilly through workforce development and customized training to ensure a robust pipeline of talent,\u201d Gateway president Ritu Raju said in a statement. \u201cGateway has a strong track record of working with industry partners to develop programs and training that align perfectly with their needs. These partnerships have contributed to mutual success for our industries and our students.\u201d The investment also validates real estate developers\u2019 investments in Kenosha County, according to developers active in the area. Scott Yauck, president and chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based Cobalt Partners, is leading a trailblazing $400 million project in downtown Kenosha. Cobalt began construction on the first of several buildings last year, but Yauck said Lilly\u2019s announcement encouraged the firm to more seriously pursue the second and third phases of the project. \u201cThe fact that (Lilly) is projecting 750 higher paying jobs \u2013 engineering and related \u2013 is certainly good for our residential buildings,\u201d Yauck said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to draw people to the area that need housing. I think what we\u2019re trying to establish downtown is a critical mass to really have a sustainable sort of ecosystem down there.\u201d Likewise, Milwaukee-based Three Leaf Partners said the announcement was encouraging for its Theater Terrace project in downtown Kenosha. Three Leaf was a partner on the development team for the 68-unit project that opened last spring. \u201cLilly\u2019s investment aligns well with the increased housing demand anticipated from such significant regional economic investments,\u201d said John Ford, Three Leaf\u2019s chief development officer.",

While the pharmaceutical company denies any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the terms to demonstrate its commitment to improving insulin accessibility. The settlement establishes a critical structure for affordable insulin, offering a significant relief for insulin-dependent Minnesotans.\n\nBitcoin will be $200,000 by 2026, Anthony Scaramucci says CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2026, Anthony Scaramucci says\n\nBitcoin will be $200,000 by 2026, Anthony Scaramucci says CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2026, Anthony Scaramucci says\n\nMinnesota initiated this lawsuit in 2018 under the state\u2019s former Attorney General, Lori Swanson. The lawsuit contended that high insulin prices imposed undue burdens on insulin-dependent individuals. The settlement agreement is consistent with similar resolutions reached by Eli Lilly and Sanofi, two other major insulin manufacturers. Notably, the settlement requires Novo Nordisk to make insulin affordable at a price point ensuring more equitable access \u2014 $35 per month \u2014 irrespective of the patient\u2019s insurance status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis price cap is expected to make a significant impact, given the high cost of insulin and the financial strain it imposes on individuals relying on it for daily survival. By limiting the price to $35, insulin will become more attainable for many Minnesotans, particularly those in low-income groups. Additionally, the agreement outlines provisions for free insulin supplies to qualifying low-income residents, further emphasizing the settlement\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s compliance with the settlement reflects broader industry changes. The notable shift in pricing strategy aligns with a growing trend among pharmaceutical companies towards more transparent and affordable medication pricing. This trend has evolved in response to increasing public and governmental pressure for pharmaceutical transparency and fairness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this progressive settlement, Novo Nordisk maintains its stance of denying any misconduct or exploitation in its initial pricing strategies. The decision to settle indicates a strategic move to focus on forward-looking initiatives and social responsibility rather than engaging in prolonged legal disputes. The company\u2019s U.S. operations are based out of New Jersey, enhancing the significance of its involvement in the Newark court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThe measure provides a model that other states may observe closely, potentially influencing further settlements or policy adjustments that target inflated medication prices. Such settlements reinforce ongoing dialogues about healthcare affordability and the role of pharmaceutical companies in ensuring access to essential medications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuartz Intelligence Newsroom uses generative artificial intelligence to report on business trends.

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Biological Drugs - Global Strategic Business Report\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global market for Biological Drugs was estimated at US$345.3 Billion in 2023 and is projected to reach US$634.4 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2023 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.\n\n\n\nBiological drugs have transformed the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes by offering highly targeted, effective therapies. Biologics are also at the forefront of precision medicine, enabling treatments to be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup, which enhances therapeutic outcomes and reduces side effects.\n\nHow Is the R&D Pipeline Shaping the Future of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe biological drugs market is witnessing significant innovation, particularly in monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies, and therapeutic proteins. New biologics are being developed to address unmet medical needs, especially in areas like oncology, neurology, and rare genetic disorders. Advances in biotechnology, including CRISPR and CAR-T therapies, are allowing for the development of personalized biologics that can modify disease pathways or even repair defective genes. The growing number of biologics in the development pipeline, coupled with advances in manufacturing techniques like continuous bioprocessing, is making it easier to produce biologics at scale, which will be key to meeting global healthcare needs in the future.\n\n\n\nHow Is the Adoption of Biological Drugs Impacting Healthcare Systems?\n\n\n\nAs biologics become more prevalent in treating chronic and life-threatening diseases, they are reshaping healthcare delivery systems. However, their high cost has led to challenges in terms of affordability and accessibility, particularly in developing markets. To address this, biosimilars - essentially, cheaper, highly similar versions of biologic drugs - are gaining traction.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of biosimilars is expected to reduce the overall healthcare burden and make these life-saving treatments more accessible to a broader population. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to facilitate the approval and market entry of biosimilars, which could significantly influence pricing dynamics and competition in the biological drugs market.\n\n\n\nWhat Role Does Regulatory Approval Play in the Expansion of Biological Drugs?\n\n\n\nThe regulatory landscape for biological drugs is a critical factor in market growth. Stringent approval processes ensure that biologics meet the highest safety and efficacy standards, which can be a lengthy and expensive endeavor for drug manufacturers. However, as regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) streamline pathways for both biologics and biosimilars, the pace of approvals has increased, particularly for drugs targeting rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Favorable regulations and accelerated approval processes for orphan drugs and breakthrough therapies are helping to bring innovative biologics to market more quickly, contributing to the overall expansion of this sector.\n\n\n\nThe growth in the biological drugs market is driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the rise of precision medicine, and advancements in biotechnological research. The growing demand for personalized therapies that offer more effective treatment with fewer side effects is a major driver.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of novel biologics for rare and complex conditions, along with favorable government policies supporting biologics R&D, is boosting market expansion. The rise of biosimilars is also playing a critical role, as they are poised to increase market accessibility and reduce treatment costs, thereby further driving growth in the biologics segment.\n\nReport Features:\n\nComprehensive Market Data: Independent analysis of annual sales and market forecasts in US$ Million from 2023 to 2030.\n\nIn-Depth Regional Analysis: Detailed insights into key markets, including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa.\n\nCompany Profiles: Coverage of major players in the Global Biological Drugs Market such as Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Biogen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and more.\n\nComplimentary Updates: Receive free report updates for one year to keep you informed of the latest market developments.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nMarket Growth: Understand the significant growth trajectory of the Therapeutic Protein segment, which is expected to reach US$289.1 Billion by 2030 with a CAGR of a 10.3%.

            "content": "Eli Lilly makes the popular shots Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nNext, the company says they have a pill coming that could be as powerful as rival Ozempic.\n\nThe company's head of obesity said the ultimate goal is to develop a once-per-year shot.\n\nImagine this: You walk into your doctor and get your yearly flu vaccine and a yearly dose of your weight-loss injection. If Eli Lilly has its way, this may be the future of obesity care.\n\nEli Lilly makes some of the most powerful weight-loss drugs in the world. The company has pivoted dramatically over the past several years, going from a major insulin provider to a GLP-1 injection juggernaut.\n\nLeading the charge is Patrik Jonsson, a 35-year Lilly veteran who got his start as a sales rep for the company in Sweden. For the past year, Jonsson has run Lilly Diabetes and Obesity, which means he oversees everything from insulin shots to the newer, high-demand drugs now known as \"weight-loss\" shots: Mounjaro, prescribed for diabetes, and Zepbound, for obesity.\n\nIf you ask him what he's most excited about, it's not a daily, weekly, or even monthly medicine for weight loss or diabetes control. His eye is trained on a one-and-done solution, a slow-release compound that patients could one day have access to at an annual checkup and then not have to worry about for a year. Jonsson says scientists inside the company are already working on making a yearly weight-loss shot a reality.\n\nHere are the small steps they're taking this year to get there.\n\nEli Lilly's oral weight loss pill, orforglipron\n\nThere is only one GLP-1 pill on the market, and it's not as effective as Ozempic for weight loss. Grace Cary/Getty Images\n\nEli Lilly competitor Novo Nordisk kicked off the weight-loss drug craze when it started selling Ozempic in the US in 2017. Back then, the once-weekly drug was only approved to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt took a while to become popular as an off-label weight loss aid. Once it did, demand skyrocketed above what the company could produce.\n\nIn clinical trials, Ozempic has consistently helped people lose, on average, about 15% of their body weight over the course of a year. Still, it requires a special injector pen and consistent refrigeration. Patients also reported uncomfortable side effects from Ozempic, like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nEli Lilly hopes that a new pill it's developing can do everything Ozempic can without the hassles. It's called orforglipron (put the emphasis on the second syllable: or-FOUR-glip-ron).\n\n\"It takes a while to get used to it, even for us,\" Jonsson said of the awkward generic drug name, in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nLike Ozempic, the new pill is designed to mimic the glucagon-like peptide 1 hormone that our bodies produce naturally, albeit in very small, transient doses. In earlier phase two trials the company sponsored, patients taking orforglipron achieved about 14.7% weight loss, on average, almost matching Ozempic.\n\n\"When you do phase three trials, you continue for a longer period of time, and normally you see a continued weight loss,\" he told BI.\n\nThe company is working on wrapping up those final phase three trials right now. The hope is that results will be available for regulators to review by the end of 2025.\n\nWhat if you could mimic the benefits of Ozempic with a once-daily pill? That's what Eli Lilly is hoping for. Steve Christo - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images\n\n\"We actually believe that we have an oral here that could generate the same amount of weight loss as you see with Wegovy or Ozempic, but in a pill,\" Jonsson added, echoing what Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month.\n\nIf that final trial goes well, orforglipron could be available to consumers (with a snappier, yet-to-be-decided brand name) in early 2026. That would be good news for folks with needle phobia, but the even bigger opportunity would be the mass market that a daily weight-loss pill could unlock.\n\n\"Most importantly, when you look at the global need, we expect that there are more than one billion people across the globe that are suffering from obesity,\" Jonsson said. \"There is no way that we can meet those demands with injectable treatments today.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk already has a daily oral GLP-1 pill with the same active ingredient as Ozempic. Called Rybelsus, it has been FDA-approved to help treat type 2 diabetes since 2019. It isn't approved for weight loss, and in trials of patients with diabetes, it wasn't as effective as Ozempic or Mounjaro at decreasing \"food noise\" or prompting weight loss.\n\nRybelsus can also be kind of a chore to take, because it works best when patients fast overnight beforehand and then only drink a few small sips of water for the first 30 minutes afterward. Jonsson says orforglipron is likely more effective than Rybelsus because of pharmaceutical differences between the molecules, which impact things like absorption.\n\n\"This has been an evolution, to discover incretins with more appealing pharmacological properties,\" he said. \"Not all GLP-1s are the same.\"\n\nRetatrutide, the 'King Kong' drug to mimic bariatric surgery\n\nEli Lilly's retatrutide has been called the \"King Kong\" of weight loss shots: in early trials, people on the highest dose of this medication lost an average of 24% of their body weight in one year. LMPC via Getty Images\n\nEli Lilly isn't pivoting away from weekly weight loss injections entirely. It's also working on another, even more powerful weight-loss shot.\n\nWhile Ozempic mimics one hunger-relieving hormone, and Mounjaro mimics two, Eli Lilly is working on what's called a \"triple agonist,\" with three different hormone-like substances inside.\n\nResearchers testing the drug say this shot could be as powerful as bariatric surgery, with patients losing roughly a quarter of their body weight in one year.\n\n\"You have GLP-1 receptor agonist, you have GIP receptor agonist, but then we're adding the pharmacology of glucagon as well,\" Jonsson said. (Glucagon, like insulin, is one of the hormones that regulates blood sugar.)\n\nThe shot, called retatrutide, is already looking more powerful than any drug on the market in this category, earning it the nickname \"King Kong\" from doctors and researchers working in diabetes and weight loss treatment. It will likely be reserved to treat patients who have a BMI over 35.\n\n\"We also expect there to be some benefits in terms of cardiovascular benefits, kidney benefits, and liver benefits because it has demonstrated reduced liver fat in earlier studies,' Jonsson said. \"So it could potentially be really, really appealing for the treatment of MASH [a chronic liver disease], for example.\"\n\nWhile it's still uncertain whether final retatrutide trial results will be available to submit to the FDA in 2025, Jonsson said it \"might\" happen, setting up the drug to potentially become available in 2026.\n\nIf the \"King Kong\" shot does become available, that might be enough horsepower to treat the most severe obesity cases. Then, instead of chasing more and more powerful injections, the diabetes and weight loss market may pivot to perfecting techniques, aiming to reduce side effects or lower muscle loss while upping fat loss, Jonsson said.\n\n\"With adding the pharmacology of glucagon, we might get very close to the amount of weight loss one should aspire to,\" he said.\n\nThe dream: a once-a-year obesity shot\n\nJonsson imagines a future where your doctor can give you a slow-release GLP-1 shot once a year, eliminating the need for prescription refills and weekly needle sticks at home. Jackyenjoyphotography/Getty Images\n\nWhen Jonsson goes into full crystal ball-gazing mode, he imagines a future where these drugs could become as convenient as flu vaccines \u2014 though affordable weight-loss medications may remain a pipe dream.\n\n\"Really, the big aspiration here would be to find something once and done,\" he said.\n\nHe imagines a futuristic scenario in which patients are administered their once-yearly hormone shot during an annual doctor's visit.\n\n\"That's what I know our researchers are aspiring to deliver, but it's not going to happen this decade,\" he said.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "A next-generation Novo Nordisk obesity drug designed to hit two targets has preliminary clinical data showing 22% weight loss, results that suggest the once-weekly injection could have an edge over the company\u2019s main metabolic medicines rival, Eli Lilly.\n\nThe drug, amycretin, is a peptide designed to bind to and activate both the GLP-1 and amylin receptors. Novo Nordisk is developing the molecule for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, testing both injectable and oral formulations. The results announced Friday are from a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating amycretin administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection in 125 patients with overweight or obesity. The proof-of-concept portion of the trial assessed escalating doses for up to 36 weeks.\n\nThe 22% weight loss reported in the study was for the highest dose: 20 mg weekly for 36 weeks. The results reported by Novo Nordisk also show that participants who received a placebo experienced weight gain, which is unusual for an obesity study. Regarding amycretin\u2019s safety, the company said the drug\u2019s profile was consistent with other therapies that mimic gut hormones. Gastrointestinal complications are common with these therapies, and Novo Nordisk said most such events in the trial were mild to moderate. The company offered no additional detail.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nNovo Nordisk is taking multiple shots on the goal of developing a next-generation obesity drug. CagriSema, for example, combines semaglutide, the main pharmaceutical ingredient in the company\u2019s approved obesity med Wegovy, with another engineered peptide called cagrilintide. Novo Nordisk last month reported this once-weekly injection achieved statistically significant weight loss in a Phase 3 study, but those results were below investor expectations. Based on the encouraging early results from the amycretin study, Novo Nordisk said it is planning further clinical development of this drug candidate in adults with overweight or obesity.\n\nComparing drugs across clinical trials has limitations, but acknowledging those caveats, analysts see the preliminary amycretin data as supporting Novo Nordisk\u2019s competitive position versus Eli Lilly\u2019s next-gen obesity medications. In a note sent to investors, William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said the highest amycretin dose tested appears to slightly outperform retatrutide, an experimental Lilly drug designed to hit three targets. But Hsieh also flagged the average weight increase observed from participants who received a placebo, which could have improved the average weight loss magnitude for amycretin by 4.5% to 5.0%. Furthermore, the company did not say how many patients discontinued the study drug in the clinical trial. The results were based on those who adhered to treatment, which Hsieh said has the potential to inflate the treatment effect in the real-world setting.\n\nThe lack of detailed safety data was a sticking point for Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. Though initial results for oral amycretin reported last March showed strong weight loss results at 12 weeks, the presentation of more detailed data at the European Society of Diabetes meeting last September showed high rates of nausea and vomiting \u2014 higher than Lilly\u2019s Zepbound in its pivotal study.\n\n\u201cWe thus await detailed results from [Novo Nordisk\u2019s] injectable amycretin trial at a medical conference this year to better assess the drug\u2019s full profile,\u201d Risinger said.\n\nPhoto: Liselotte Sabroe/Scanpix Denmark/AFP, via Getty Images",

            "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about prescription drug prices during an appearance in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 20, 2020. Carlos Barria | Reuters\n\nPharmaceutical companies appear to be hopeful about their growth under a Trump administration, after former President Joe Biden took a hardline stance on the industry for the last four years. Like his predecessor, President Donald Trump will make lowering health-care costs for Americans a priority. It's a popular bipartisan issue in a nation where patients pay two-to-three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries. Trump has not yet outlined specific health policy plans, but his new administration will likely take a different, more pro-business approach than Biden's did. Drugmakers hope Trump will focus more on cracking down on middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, while taking heat off the prices the pharma companies themselves charge, promoting drug innovation and improving patient access to treatments. Those companies are particularly eager to see changes to Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which includes landmark provisions that aim to make medicines more affordable \u2014 but that the industry views as a threat to innovation and its profits. That was the sentiment during the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco this month, the largest gathering in the U.S. of pharma and biotech executives and investors. The annual conference gives a pulse on the industry's outlook for the year ahead. To no surprise, health policy questions dominated many of the conversations as Trump was heading into office. Trump isn't exactly a friendly face to the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, as he targeted companies and high drug costs during his first term through proposals like linking government payments for medicines to lower prices paid abroad. Still, executives stressed they are ready to work with Trump, who some described as being willing to hear out their grievances. \"There are several people that think for our industry, the risks outweigh the opportunities. There are other people, among them myself, which they think that the opportunities outweigh the risks. I guess we'll see,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during a presentation at the conference. \"What we do as an industry, and as Pfizer, is engage with the new administration,\" he later added. \"We have very productive engagements and we try to explain the positions, I think that are well-understood.\" Still, some executives acknowledged uncertainties around the new administration, such as the anti-vaccine views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Health experts have said that Kennedy, if confirmed by the Senate, may not do much to stop vaccine approvals, but could deter more Americans from taking recommended shots. \"I think he represents the caution when it comes to the Trump administration,\" BMO biotech analyst Evan Seigerman said. \"You got to figure out how to work with him, right?\"\n\nPharmacy benefit manager reform\n\nPBM reform is top of mind for drugmakers. They argue that the middlemen overcharge insurance plans for which they negotiate medication rebates, underpay pharmacies for dispensing prescriptions and fail to pass on savings from those discounts to patients. Congress stripped out bipartisan PBM reforms in the final federal government spending package late last year, even after lawmakers for years introduced bills and held hearings to scrutinize them. But the pharmaceutical industry is \"optimistic\" that it will see PBM reform this year, as Trump, lawmakers and lawmakers from both parties are concerned about their practices, said Stephen Ubl, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's biggest lobbying group in the U.S. \"I think there continues to be significant momentum behind PBM reforms, and there will be ... legislative vehicles available this year to move them forward,\" Ubl said in an interview with CNBC. He also pointed to a previous Trump proposal that the president could revisit: To eliminate the so-called safe harbor for rebates \u2013 a rule that sought to stop PBMs from keeping rebates and instead ensure that any discounts from drugmakers would directly reach patients. Trump has signaled that he will target PBMs, saying at a news conference in December, \"We're going to knock out the middleman. We're going to get drug costs down at levels that nobody has ever seen before.\" But Trump still has to figure out if he will change the Biden administration's approach to PBM reform, said Seigerman. Biden's FTC Chair Lina Khan carried out an extensive investigation into the middlemen and then sued them for allegedly inflating insulin prices. \"The fact that it was a Lina Khan priority makes it harder for Trump because he'll either outright reject something from the Biden administration or say, 'We did it better,' and take full credit,\" Seigerman said. Ubl pointed to three key reforms the industry wants to see, the first of which is \"breaking the link\" between a drug's list price and how PBMs are compensated. Currently, the higher price of a covered drug leads to bigger potential rebates that PBMs can keep as profit. That incentivizes the middlemen to steer patients toward higher-priced medicines and keep cheaper generic and biosimilar drugs off of insurance formularies, or lists of covered drugs, according to Ubl. The second reform is to ensure the rebates reach patients at the pharmacy counter, which could be achieved by reviving Trump's previous proposal or through other policies, Ubl said. The last reform would be increasing transparency around the PBM business model, such as the rebates they collect and their markup practices, since it is \"largely opaque\" to employers and other stakeholders, according to Ubl. \"We know the supply chain, PBMs are not transparent enough and we should be able to pass through more of that savings directly to consumers,\" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said during a presentation at the conference. PBMs deny that they contribute to higher drug prices, and often shift the blame to drugmakers who set the initial list prices for drugs before negotiations. Cigna's Express Scripts, one of the three major PBMs in the U.S., has claimed that it passes more than 95% of all rebate dollars to its health plan clients. Top PBM executives have also said they are open to increased transparency around their businesses, but companies have yet to make significant changes on that front.\n\nChanges to Medicare drug price negotiations\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is also hopeful that Trump could work with Congress to revise a piece of the IRA that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers \u2014 a popular policy that could bring significant savings for senior patients. The Biden administration kicked off the second cycle of that process last week, unveiling the next 15 drugs selected for the price talks. But dismantling or scaling back the IRA would be difficult, Seigerman said. He pointed to Trump's unsuccessful attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during his first administration, even when he had control of the House and Senate. That law expanded insurance coverage for uninsured patients. Health policy experts previously told CNBC that it also seems unlikely that a Trump administration would want to scrap efforts to lower drug prices, a bipartisan issue that is top of mind for Americans. Still, the industry will continue to fight the law in a flurry of legal challenges, which have so far been unsuccessful. Drugmakers argue that the provision will slash their profits, hinder investments in research and development for certain medications and result in unintended consequences for patients, such as fewer treatments and higher premiums. The industry also argues the process is government-mandated \"price-setting\" rather than negotiations since companies that don't agree to the talks must either pay an excise tax or withdraw all their medications from the Medicare and Medicaid markets. Though in one failed court challenge last year, a federal judge argued that participating in those markets is voluntary. PhRMA's Ubl said the biggest issue with the law is what the industry calls the \"pill penalty.\" The law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, compared to just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry argues that the discrepancy discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are more convenient for patients. Fewer small molecule drugs will likely mean fewer cheaper generic versions of them on the market in the U.S., Eli Lilly's Ricks said during the conference. \"I think that's a terrible outcome because that's the most efficient, cheapest thing going in health care,\" he said. A revision of the law would require legislative action, but Ubl said some changes could take place without Congress. For example, PhRMA does not believe all drugs with the same active ingredient should be up for price talks when they are approved under different names for different uses. That was the case last week when Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy, diabetes treatment Ozempic and another diabetes drug Rybelsus were selected as one product for the price talks since they share the same active ingredient.\n\nThe RFK Jr. question",

            "content": "Cathie Wood is the founder of Ark Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technologies. In 2023, she predicted software companies would be the next big investment opportunity when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), saying they could generate $8 in revenue for every dollar they spend on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nWood positioned many of Ark's ETFs to reflect that view. The Ark Innovation ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKK) and the Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKQ) offer very healthy exposure to AI software stocks, and they delivered returns of 34% and 57%, respectively, over the last 12 months.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nHere's why investors might want to own both ETFs if Wood proves to be right -- but beware, they have a history of generating very volatile returns.\n\n1. Ark Innovation ETF\n\nThe Ark Innovation ETF is the firm's flagship fund. It's actively managed, which means Wood and her team buy and sell stocks within the portfolio whenever they feel adjustments will benefit shareholders. The fund primarily invests in \"disruptive innovation,\" which Ark describes as any technology that has the potential to change how the world works.\n\nThose technologies include next-generation cloud computing, precision therapies, digital assets, and AI subsegments like autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, and neural networks.\n\nThe Ark ETF holds 34 different stocks and securities, but its top five positions alone account for 43.8% of the total value of its portfolio:\n\nStock Ark ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) 14.39% 2. Roku 8.98% 3. Coinbase 8.77% 4. Roblox 6.47% 5. Robinhood Markets 5.24%\n\nThose five holdings don't appear to be AI software stocks at face value. However, Wood believes Tesla is the biggest AI project in the entire world because of its full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla recently unveiled its autonomous Cybercab robotaxi, which will launch with no steering wheel or even pedals because it will be powered entirely by FSD.\n\nArk's research suggests Tesla's annual revenue could grow more than tenfold to $1.2 trillion by 2029, with 63% coming from FSD software and the Cybercab platform.\n\nEven Roku, the provider of streaming services and smart televisions, uses AI to direct relevant content to its users to create a more engaging experience. Plus, its latest smart TVs use an AI software feature called Smart Picture to optimize the display depending on what you're watching.\n\nOutside of its top five positions, the Ark Innovation ETF holds other popular AI software stocks like Palantir Technologies, Tempus AI, UiPath, Meta Platforms, and more.\n\nSpecialized, actively managed ETFs usually aren't cheap to own, and this one is no exception. It has an expense ratio of 0.75%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. Index funds from issuers like Vanguard, for example, typically charge 0.1% per year (or less). Higher fees can detract from investors' returns over time.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Ark's ETFs tend to be quite volatile because of the stocks they hold. Despite delivering a strong return of 34% over the last 12 months, the Ark Innovation ETF is still down 60% from its record high set during 2021. It has the potential to do extremely well over the long term because of AI, but investors need to brace for big swings in performance.\n\n2. Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF\n\nThis Ark ETF has a much narrower focus, because it invests exclusively in just a few areas of the tech sector like AI, robotics, and automation. It's also actively managed, so Wood and her team regularly adjust its portfolio.\n\nThe ETF currently holds 37 different stocks, and its top five account for 45.2% of the total value of its portfolio:\n\nStock Ark ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Tesla 14.54% 2. Kratos Defense 9.90% 3. Teradyne 8.41% 4. Rocket Labs 6.68% 5. Archer Aviation 5.66%\n\nYou will notice Tesla is also the top holding in this ETF, which speaks to Wood's conviction about the future of autonomous driving. Speaking of which, Kratos Defense designs and manufactures unmanned systems, including autonomous fighter planes and trucks, designed to help the U.S. military achieve its goals while placing fewer troops in harm's way.\n\nThen there is Teradyne, which helps businesses across several industries automate their processes. It even makes autonomous robots capable of transporting products and equipment around manufacturing facilities.\n\nOutside of its top five holdings, the Ark ETF holds Palantir, Amazon, UiPath, and Alphabet, all of which have a presence in AI software. The ETF even holds Nvidia, which, despite being known for its AI hardware, offers the software its customers need to create autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe Ark Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%. However, it has still delivered a compound annual return of 14.8% since it was established in 2014, which outpaces the average annual return of 11.8% in the Ark Innovation ETF over the same period.\n\nIt's even beating the S&P 500, which has delivered a compound annual return of 13.7% since 2014.\n\nThis ETF is down by just 15% from its 2021 record high, so it's recovering at a much faster pace than the Innovation ETF. If Wood proves to be right about AI software, it won't be long before the fund is trading at new all-time highs.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 937% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026\n\nLearn more \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 21, 2025\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "content": "Weight loss treatments Mounjaro and Zepbound are the primary growth engines for Eli Lilly right now, but the company has another enormous opportunity that's getting very little attention.\n\nFor the last couple of years, the pharmaceutical sector has become infatuated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists used to treat diabetes and help with chronic weight management. While Novo Nordisk's Ozempic is the most mainstream GLP-1 medication, Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) has two blockbuster weight loss drugs of its own: Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nMounjaro and Zepbound are by far Lilly's fastest-growing businesses, and the company's momentum in the GLP-1 realm seems to be the only thing Wall Street analysts are talking about these days. While weight loss is an enormous opportunity, Lilly has a broad portfolio of medications treating many different pockets of the healthcare landscape.\n\nBeyond Mounjaro and Zepbound, I'd encourage investors to take a serious look at Lilly's oncology business. Below, I'll explore how the company is quietly making significant strides in treating cancer and make the case for why this could be Lilly's next big opportunity.\n\nHow big is the cancer market?\n\nAccording to data compiled by Coherent Market Insights, the global oncology drug market is expected to be worth $533 billion by 2031 -- more than double its estimated value today.\n\nWhen it comes to treating cancer, I wouldn't be surprised if names such as Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, or Merck come to mind first. But believe it or not, Lilly has a flourishing oncology operation in its portfolio. In my eyes, this area of the company is being completely overshadowed by Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nHow is Lilly treating cancer?\n\nThrough the third quarter of 2024, Lilly generated total revenue of $31.5 billion -- an increase of 27% year over year. Roughly $15 billion of this total stems from just three drugs -- Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Trulicity. All of these are medications in Lilly's weight loss portfolio.\n\nHowever, another star performer throughout 2024 was Verzenio -- Lilly's main oncology treatment. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, sales from Verzenio topped $3.7 billion and grew 38% year over year. The subtle idea I'd like to point out here is that Verzenio alone is growing at a much more accelerated rate than Lilly's business as a whole.\n\nOne of the primary drivers for Verzenio's performance is an expanded indication the drug was granted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) back in March 2023. While this is all great news for Verzenio, Lilly isn't stopping its ambitions in oncology care with just one treatment.\n\nRight now, the company has seven clinical trials underway exploring new molecules and applications in the cancer market. To further bolster its pursuit of becoming a leading player in the oncology market, Lilly also recently announced that it is acquiring a clinical stage drug known as STX-478 from Scorpion Therapeutics for up to $2.5 billion.\n\nLilly's long-term potential doesn't hinge on GLP-1 treatments\n\nSince the company reported third-quarter earnings in late October, shares of Lilly have dropped by about 13%.\n\nThe primary reason the stock has been sliding is due to some inconsistent growth trends between Mounjaro and Zepbound over the last quarter. But as I pointed out in this piece, even with some turbulence between supply and demand, Mounjaro and Zepbound are still on pace for a record performance in Q4 -- despite falling short of Wall Street's aggressive targets.\n\nIt's for this very reason that I encourage investors to look beyond weight loss when it comes to an investment in Eli Lilly. The company is well diversified and is witnessing notable success in areas outside of the GLP-1 realm.\n\nVerzenio's performance in 2024 underscores how expanded indications for medications can accelerate their performance and help contribute to the overall picture in a meaningful way. To me, oncology represents a hugely important new area for Lilly, and one that is ripe for disruption given the size of the addressable market.\n\nI think the company's clinical pipeline and recent acquisition from Scorpion really drive home the point that Lilly's management is thinking much farther into the future, well beyond where the GLP-1 business can go.",

Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Obesity is a growing concern in India, contributing to conditions such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. According to NFHS-5, 9.3% of men and 13.2% of women in India are obese. To address this, American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is focusing on weight loss medications like Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which has proven effective in managing both obesity and type-2 diabetes.\n\nVineet Gupta, Associate Vice President and Managing Director of India and Alliances at Eli Lilly, spoke with Business Today about the company's plans to launch Mounjaro in India by 2025, pending regulatory approvals.\n\nHe highlighted the drug's potential to address the growing obesity and type-2 diabetes issue in India and the company\u2019s efforts to expand its pipeline of therapies targeting obesity-related conditions. Edited excerpts from the interview:\n\nBT: Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro (tirzepatide) has garnered significant attention globally for its efficacy in managing obesity and type-2 diabetes. When can we expect its launch in India, and how do you view the market opportunity here?\n\nVG: We aim to launch tirzepatide in India by 2025, once we obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. We are optimistic about the response from the Indian market. Given the rising prevalence of obesity and its associated health risks, access to evidence-based treatments like tirzepatide can significantly improve health outcomes for individuals.\n\nBT: What challenges do you foresee in regulatory approvals and distribution for anti-obesity medications in India?\n\nVG: Regulatory approvals for any innovative therapy, including anti-obesity medications, are essential steps to ensure both the safety and efficacy of the treatment before it reaches patients. India has an evolving regulatory landscape that is becoming increasingly supportive of addressing pressing health challenges like obesity. We have obtained the required regulatory approvals for some formats of tirzepatide, while the approval process for other device options is still in progress. We are hopeful of receiving the approvals soon.\n\nOur country already has a well-established distribution and supply network for cold chain products such as insulin, so we do not foresee any challenges in the distribution of anti-obesity medications in India.\n\nBT: With anti-obesity drugs gaining global traction, how is Eli Lilly adapting its global success strategies to suit the Indian market?\n\nVG: Obesity is a growing health challenge in India, with significant implications for both individual well-being and the healthcare system. It\u2019s critical to address not only the medical aspects but also the stigma that often surrounds this condition. There is limited awareness among the public and healthcare providers about obesity\u2019s classification as a chronic condition.\n\nDespite its prevalence, obesity often does not receive the same attention in diagnosis and medical care. Furthermore, people living with obesity face challenges, especially with weight stigma and bias. Misconceptions about obesity often lead to discrimination, with many believing that weight is solely an individual\u2019s fault. Tackling obesity requires a comprehensive, multifaceted approach that supports both awareness and effective management. We are committed to collaborating with healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health organisations to build a robust ecosystem that drives awareness and improves health outcomes. Lilly is excited about the opportunity to improve the lives of people in the country.\n\nBT: Are there other drugs in Eli Lilly\u2019s pipeline targeting obesity or related conditions that we can expect in the near future?\n\nVG: India is an important market for Lilly. We are committed to accelerating the process of bringing our innovative products to the country, which includes medicines for cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology, and neuroscience.",

            "content": "Some people make it a New Year's resolution to improve their finances by investing in stocks. It's a laudable goal, and to get started, it's crucial to pick stocks that have the tools to perform well for decades to come. Corporations that fit this criteria are a rare breed, but they do exist.\n\nBelow, I'll look at two companies in the healthcare sector: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). For those with $5,000 to invest that's not being saved for routine expenses or emergencies, purchasing shares of these two companies could be a great move.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\n1. Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly started 2024 on a strong note but struggled during the second half of the year. The drugmaker dealt with several headwinds, including the fact that it didn't meet investors' sky-high expectations.\n\nThe company's third-quarter revenue grew by 20% year over year to $11.4 billion, a terrific performance for almost any other pharmaceutical company. However, Eli Lilly missed analyst estimates for the period, sending its stock price down. However, these short-term issues mean little for the company's long-term prospects.\n\nOver the past few years, Eli Lilly has demonstrated that it's an innovative company. The drugmaker developed several breakthrough medicines, including tirzepatide, its famous diabetes and weight loss management treatment that was the first dual GLP-1/GIP to earn approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It also launched Kisunla, one of the few Alzheimer's disease treatments to get the green light in the last two decades, earning this therapeutic area the label of the \"graveyard\" of investigational medicines.\n\nThese (and other) products should drive top-line growth for Eli Lilly well into the 2030s. The healthcare giant has several exciting late-stage pipeline candidates, too, especially in the weight loss market. Eli Lilly's long, successful history of dominating the diabetes market is more important than any specific drug or pipeline program.\n\nThis doesn't happen by accident. The company has created and fostered an internal culture of innovation honed by many successes (and failures) over decades. That's what should allow Eli Lilly to continue producing billion-dollar drugs, excellent financial results, and market-beating performances.\n\nFor income-oriented investors, Eli Lilly has a solid dividend program, too. All things considered, the company is an excellent forever stock to invest in -- and $5,000 will get you six shares with change left over.\n\n2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is well-known for developing and marketing drugs that treat cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic condition that damages patients' lungs. It was the first company to create approved medicines that target the underlying causes of CF, rather than just treating some symptoms of the disease. Since the approval of Vertex's first CF medicine in 2012, no other company has cracked this code, despite plenty of them trying.\n\nThat's no small feat. It's no surprise, then, that Vertex's revenue and earnings have grown rapidly in the past decade.\n\nVRTX Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nVRTX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nThe question for investors is whether Vertex's work in CF was an anomaly -- a one-off that the company can't reproduce in other areas -- but the evidence suggests otherwise. In 2023, Vertex earned approval for Casgevy, a gene-editing treatment for two rare blood-related conditions with very few treatment options.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals didn't create Casgevy itself -- that was CRISPR Therapeutics' accomplishment. However, that should mean little to investors. Penning lucrative deals with smaller drugmakers is a legitimate strategy that larger companies resort to all the time. Further, Vertex has exciting pipeline candidates of its own. It could earn approval for suzetrigine, a treatment for acute pain, by the end of the month.\n\nIts late-stage pipeline features inaxaplin, a potential therapy for APOL-1-mediated kidney disease (there are currently no treatments that target its underlying causes). Vertex's early-stage type 1 diabetes candidate is also making strides.\n\nVertex's lineup will look transformed in five years, and the company should continue performing well beyond that time. It's another excellent stock to buy and hold for good. At the stock's current levels, investors can acquire 11 shares of the company with $5,000.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "Even when it's performing well, Berkshire Hathaway can't outpace the market's very best growth prospects.\n\nIt's not the biggest publicly traded company in the world right now. That honor still belongs to Apple with a market cap if just under $3.5 trillion. That's followed closely by Nvidia, currently worth $3.4 trillion. Microsoft isn't far behind at $3.2 trillion.\n\nStill, now at a $1 trillion valuation, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.51%) (BRK.B 1.68%) is no slouch. Matching -- or eclipsing -- its size would be a considerable accolade.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three names that could be worth more than Berkshire Hathaway just five years from now.\n\nThree big companies about to get even bigger\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is hardly doomed. It's not even expected to lose value. Indeed, it's likely to grow its way to a larger market capitalization over the course of the coming five years.\n\nThere is something startling about Berkshire at this time, though -- a concern that's likely to linger for the foreseeable future. That's a lack of opportunities that interest Buffett and his lieutenants. As of the most recent look, the conglomerate is sitting on more cash than stock holdings, while its privately held companies like Geico insurance, flooring company Shaw, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom (just to name a few) make up the single biggest sliver of Berkshire's current capitalization.\n\nWithout explicitly saying as much, the Oracle of Omaha would rather invest in nothing new at this time than be forced to step into a bunch of holdings he doesn't see much reason in owning for the foreseeable future.\n\nJust because few companies work as part of Berkshire Hathaway's value portfolio, however, it doesn't mean there aren't some that could be at home in yours as a growth holding. Here's a closer look at some of these prospects.\n\n1. Eli Lilly\n\nYou almost certainly know the company is a drugmaker. What you may not realize is just how much of Eli Lilly's (LLY -2.46%) current revenue comes from its diabetes treatment Mounjaro and its weight-loss drug Zepbound. Last quarter, these products accounted for a respective 27% and 11% of the pharmaceutical giant's business.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this degree of imbalance could eventually prove problematic. Not only does it leave a company too dependent on one or two particular profit centers, proven market opportunities like these also attract competitors.\n\nThese aren't normal circumstances, though. Mounjaro along with Zepbound -- both of which are the exact same molecular formula, called tirzepatide -- are still just getting started. Research and analytics outfit GlobalData predicts annual sales of Mounjaro could peak somewhere between $27 billion and $34 billion by 2029, versus its current annualized revenue run rate of just over $12 billion.\n\nThe thing is, there's every reason to believe sales of both of Eli Lilly's blockbuster drugs will continue growing the longer they're on the market and the more confidence would-be users gain in what they offer. Goldman Sachs suggests the anti-obesity drug market -- which overlaps with the diabetes treatment market -- could be worth $100 billion per year by 2030, meaning there's more than enough room for two leading products in this space. It's an opportunity with a scope of growth that Berkshire Hathaway just doesn't seem to have.\n\nAnd it doesn't have far to go to become bigger than Buffett's baby. Eli Lilly's current market cap is right around $650 billion.\n\n2. Visa\n\nWith nothing more than a passing thought, credit card companies like Visa (V -1.29%) don't seem like particularly high-growth holdings. Payments are simply a reflection of economic activity, after all, and the global economy's growth rates are relatively limited.\n\nVisa is consistently outpacing overall worldwide spending growth, though, for a couple of reasons. The first of these reasons is simply that cards continue to displace cash and checks as forms of payment.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve reports that between 2016 and 2023, cash fell as the preferred form of payments made within the United States, from 31% of transactions then to 16% now, while credit card usage soared from 18% of transactions to 32%. Plastic is simply easier and more convenient to use.\n\nAnd, given the ongoing growth of e-commerce, in many cases cards are increasingly the only viable means of purchasing certain goods and services. Given the Census Bureau's estimate that only about 16% of domestic retail spending is currently done online, don't be surprised to see this proportion continue growing along with card-based transaction sizes.\n\nThe same basic dynamics are evident overseas as well, of course.\n\nAnd the other reason Visa's been able to reliably drive annual top-line growth between 8% and 15% and even-stronger profit growth? Because it's not simply resting on its laurels and existing dominance of most of this market (Capital One reports Visa accounts for over 60% of domestic card-based purchase volume).\n\nVisa makes a point of innovating in ways that put more of its plastic in consumers' hands, and inducing these cardholders to use their cards more often -- sometimes without even knowing exactly how its efforts might pay off. Namely, Visa supports several so-called Innovation Centers all over the world, which not only operate somewhat independently of the core company, but even operate independently of one another.\n\nFun fact: Buffett already owns a stake in Visa. Berkshire Hathaway's currently sitting on an 8.3 million share/$2.6 billion position in the credit card company, underscoring the argument for holding some in your portfolio as well.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nFinally, add Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM -3.15%) to your list of stocks that could be worth more than Berkshire Hathaway a mere five years from now.\n\nGranted, it's got the least distance to travel to surpass Berkshire's size. Depending on both stocks' recent performances, in fact, Taiwan Semiconductor may already be the bigger company; its most recent market cap was also in the ballpark of $1 trillion.\n\nIt's still a name worth highlighting, though, if only because it's one of the market's more underestimated tickers that could be considerably bigger by 2030 than it is right now.\n\nJust as the same suggests, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures semiconductors and microchips. That description doesn't do it justice, however. This company is actually a third-party (\"contract\") manufacturer for many of the semiconductor brands you may be more familiar with. Its key customers include Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, just to name a few. All these contractual manufacturing relationships mean Taiwan Semiconductor is technically the world's biggest chipmaker, and by far the market leader of the advanced semiconductor business.\n\nSome of the tech industry's titans have tried to wean themselves from their enormous reliance on one single player. But it's proving tough to do. That's largely because -- thanks to the advent of AI and the data centers it requires -- the chip industry is growing faster than these companies can build their own chipmaking foundries. PwC predicts the global semiconductor market is poised to grow more than the twice as fast as the planet's GDP does between now and 2030, when the industry could be worth more than $1 trillion per year.\n\nThis is of course a huge tailwind for the well-positioned Taiwan Semiconductor to plug into.",

            "content": "Novo Nordisk hopes the new treatment can build on the success of its flagship obesity drug, Wegovy. (Steve Christo\u2014Corbis/Getty Images)\n\nNovo Nordisk has been one of the chief beneficiaries of the boom in GLP-1 drugs, which have shown great promise in fighting obesity. Competition in the space is fierce, but shares got a much-needed boost on Friday after the Danish pharmaceutical giant released promising trial results for a next-generation drug that the company hopes will build on the success of flagship weight-loss treatments Wegovy and Ozempic.\n\nLike those injections, the new drug targets gut hormone GLP-1 but additionally mimics amylin, a hormone released by the pancreas that suppresses hunger. Novo\u2019s U.S.-listed shares jumped over 10% in premarket trading Friday and remained up over 7% midmorning after the company said people who received the new treatment reduced their weight, on average, by 22%, over 36 weeks, compared with a weight gain of 2% for those who received a placebo. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, the company added, with the vast majority being mild to moderate in severity.\n\nBoth Wegovy, Novo\u2019s main obesity offering, and diabetes treatment Ozempic have soared in popularity and been touted as \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d for their startling efficacy in helping patients lose weight, along with other potential health benefits. That drove Novo\u2019s U.S.-listed shares to a record high of $148.15 this past June, up more than double from where they sat at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe stock has declined roughly 40% since, however, and currently trades just short of the $90 mark. One reason is pressure from American drugmaker Eli Lilly, which makes competing products Zepbound and Mounjaro (alternatives to Wegovy and Ozempic, respectively).\n\nNovo\u2019s stock fell slightly in early December after a trial sponsored by Lilly found that patients who took Zepbound lost 20.2% of their body weight, on average, compared with just a 13.7% reduction for those taking Wegovy.\n\nAn analyst at a Danish bank said that Novo\u2019s Friday trial results for the amylin treatment, however, could help restore investor faith in the company\u2019s drug pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early and not many patients, but it can give some hope that you have a product that can take over from Wegovy and that can compete to a great extent,\u201d Jyske Bank\u2019s Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told Reuters.\n\nThat does not mean investors should necessarily anticipate blockbuster returns in the year ahead. CFRA Research analyst Wan Nurhayati recently reduced his price target on the stock from $122 to $90 after the U.S. government said Ozempic and Wegovy would be among the 15 drugs targeted for a second round of Medicare price negotiations in 2027.\n\n\u201cA steep price cut might limit future sales growth (the first round of price negotiation last year saw a 38% to 79% price reduction across the selected drugs), though we still expect [Novo] to remain one of the market leaders in the obesity market,\u201d Nurhayati wrote in a note Monday. \u201cNevertheless, this news, coupled with another disappointing trial result (from a study of a higher dose of Wegovy), has added to the series of challenges for [Novo], which we think could continue to affect sentiment in the near term.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s results, however, gave shareholders a reason for cautious optimism.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) stock was the picture of health on Friday. Shares of the massive American pharmaceutical company rose by more than 2% on the day, thanks largely to news from a rival. That performance was in contrast to the S&P 500's (^GSPC -1.39%) trajectory; the closely watched index sank marginally by 0.3%.\n\nWeight loss leads to gain in bullishness\n\nEli Lilly's small pop was due to the latest developments in the lab reported by Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.47%), which, like the U.S. company, is doing brisk business with a weight loss drug: Wegovy, which competes directly with Eli Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nOn Friday morning, Novo Nordisk unveiled the latest results from a clinical trial of CagriSema, an investigational drug leveraging the foundational semaglutide molecule used in Wegovy. Participants in the 36-week trial experienced a nearly 10% reduction in body fat, on average. Gastrointestinal side effects were merely mild to moderate, according to the company.\n\nThis weight loss, and the speed at which the drug took effect, were quite encouraging. This indicates there remains much potential in the molecules used as the basis for obesity drugs -- semaglutide for Novo Nordisk, and tirzepatide in the case of Eli Lilly.\n\n\n\nAn analyst weighs in\n\nWaxing bullish about the effects of Novo Nordisk's latest findings on Eli Lilly sentiment was Bank of America Securities analyst Tim Anderson. On the back of those clinical trial results, he felt compelled to reiterate his buy recommendation on the latter company on Friday. He also maintained his $977 per-share price target.\n\nOf the two stocks, Eli Lilly looks better poised to benefit from the current weight-loss drug craze. Tirzepatide is a very effective molecule and, as a result, Zepbound has been a hot seller for the company. If any pharmaceutical producer is going to exploit the full potential of such medications, it's the well-capitalized Eli Lilly. I would even consider it to be a leading healthcare stock appropriate for any portfolio at this point.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY, Financial) experienced a rise in its stock price by 2.45% today. This upward movement stems from developments at its competitor Novo Nordisk (NVO), particularly involving their weight loss medication, Wegovy, which competes directly with Eli Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nNovo Nordisk recently unveiled clinical trial results for their investigational drug, CagriSema, which showed promising results with participants experiencing an average body fat reduction of nearly 10% over a 36-week period. The gastrointestinal side effects noted were mild to moderate, emphasizing the effectiveness of the semaglutide molecule used in Novo Nordisk\u2019s product. This result underscores the potential of similar molecules, such as Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, used in Zepbound.\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Tim Anderson has reaffirmed his buy recommendation for Eli Lilly, maintaining a price target of $977 per share based on these developments.\n\nCurrently, Eli Lilly (LLY, Financial) is trading at $785.41 per share. Despite its status as a major player in the pharmaceutical industry, the stock is considered \"Modestly Overvalued\" according to the GF Value metric, which is estimated at $706.71. This suggests that there is potential for a correction if the market re-evaluates its current valuation. The company boasts a market capitalization of $706.33 billion and has shown impressive growth figures, with a 27.2% revenue growth over the past year.\n\nEli Lilly shows solid financial fundamentals, highlighted by a strong Altman Z-score of 8.12, indicating stability and low bankruptcy risk. Its operating margin is expanding, and the dividend yield is close to a one-year high, reflecting sound profitability and investor returns.\n\nWhile the company's P/E ratio is relatively high at 84.91, suggesting a premium on future earnings, its profitability and strategic positioning in the cardiometabolic and neuroscience markets provide robust growth prospects. Investors should, however, be mindful of its debt issuance as part of its financial strategy, albeit at an acceptable level.\n\nOverall, Eli Lilly (LLY, Financial) continues to show strength in its sector, making it a compelling stock for growth-oriented investors, especially considering the promising developments in its weight loss drug portfolio.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) has become a beast in healthcare. The excitement surrounding its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, has helped boost its market capitalization to around $650 billion. Over the last five years, shares have soared by more than 400%.\n\nRecently, however, the stock has been struggling; in the past three months, Lilly's valuation has declined by 21%. It fell last week after the company released updated guidance, with revenue for its GLP-1 drugs projected to come in below expectations for the most recent quarter.\n\nIs this a sign the stock is in trouble and likely headed for more of a decline this year? Or could now be a good time to buy Eli Lilly on the dip?\n\nRevenue for GLP-1 drugs misses the mark\n\nOn Jan. 14, Eli Lilly released its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024, as well as the full year of 2025. And investors weren't thrilled with the numbers, leading to a 7% drop in the share price that day.\n\nResults for the fourth quarter of 2024 should show revenue topping $13.5 billion. That's an impressive increase of 45% year over year. It is, however, below the guidance the company issued previously. And the key numbers investors were zeroing in on were sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound, which weren't great either.\n\nFor Mounjaro, the diabetes treatment, Q4 sales will total $3.5 billion -- well short of analyst estimates of $4.4 billion. For Zepbound, which is approved for weight loss, revenue of $1.9 billion is a bit closer to expectations of $2.1 billion but falls short nonetheless. The company encountered similar issues in October, when those drugs also missed expectations.\n\nThe good news for investors is that for 2025, overall guidance is looking strong. Lilly is projecting between $58 billion and $61 billion in sales, which is mostly higher than the $58.4 billion that analysts expected. In its press release, it didn't provide specific guidance for how its top two drugs will perform over the full year, but it is expecting them to have strong growth.\n\nWhy are investors so bearish on Eli Lilly?\n\nA 45% growth rate should be welcome news under normal circumstances for a business, especially when that's a faster clip than what it's averaged in the past. Historically, this has been a much slower-growing company than it is today:\n\nThe problem, however, goes back to valuation. Eli Lilly is a stock which you might consider to be \"priced to perfection\" because of how expensive it is. Prior to this recent sell-off, it was trading at well over 100 times its trailing earnings. Even now, with the dip in value, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is close to 80, which still isn't terribly cheap. Its forward P/E multiple of 32, which is based on analyst earnings expectations, is a bit more tenable but still comes at a bit of a premium.\n\nWhen investors are paying such high price tags for a stock, expectations are high, and any kind of miss can result in a steep correction. Lilly is by no means in bad shape, but because the stock's price has become so inflated in recent years, so have expectations.\n\nIs Eli Lilly stock a good buy right now?\n\nEli Lilly's stock is off to a tough start in 2025, and it could continue that way unless Mounjaro's and Zepbound's performances improve. If you're looking at the near term, you could argue that the stock may be in danger of facing an even steeper correction in the months ahead. Investors may worry about rising competition in the GLP-1 market, and perhaps also that missed expectations indicate that demand for these drugs is slowing down.\n\nBut rolling out drugs to new markets and ensuring there is sufficient supply can be challenging. Lilly has been struggling to meet demand, and when that happens, it can be difficult to coordinate inventory levels with all of its partners and distributors. Missing sales expectations for one quarter or even multiple quarters can look bad to investors, but it's not necessarily indicative of a long-term problem for the business.\n\nEli Lilly still has a couple of fantastic drugs in Mounjaro and Zepbound, which could generate a ton of growth. Given its potential, I still see Lilly becoming the first trillion-dollar healthcare stock down the line. Resist the temptation to get too hung up on quarterly results and whether the company misses or beats expectations, as it still has plenty of growth on the horizon.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, this sell-off could make for a great time to load up on this top healthcare stock.",

            "content": "Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team.

The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.\n\n\n\nThese factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\nShares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model.\n\n\n\nGeographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Flanigan's here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) stock is in an upswing this month with the drugmaker recently announcing plans to invest $27 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint.\n\nThe new investment brings Lilly's total spending on manufacturing expansion to $50 billion since 2020.\n\nThree of the future sites will focus on manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients, re-shoring some of its small molecule chemical synthesis capabilities and strengthening the supply chain. The fourth site will focus on future injectable therapies.\n\nThe planned manufacturing bump follows President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Big Pharma companies that don't re-shore their manufacturing operations.\n\nIt also follows the Food and Drug Administration's decision to remove tirzepatide from its shortage list. This means compounding pharmacies have had to stop \u2014 or will soon have to stop \u2014 making knockoff versions of the diabetes and weight-loss drug. It also means Lilly will have to keep up with demand for the drugs it sells under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nEli Lilly stock is on a recent run. Shares have surged almost 26% from a low point at 725.01 on Jan. 17 to close at 906.02 on March 4.\n\nSo, is Lilly stock a buy or a sell right now?\n\nEli Lilly Stock: Sales Narrowly Lag\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Eli Lilly earned an adjusted $5.32 per share, soaring 114% and beating calls for $5.02 a share. Sales jumped 45% to $13.53 billion, just below expectations for $13.55 billion, according to FactSet. Despite coming up short, Mounjaro sales rocketed 124%, while Zepbound put up a triple-digit gain after launching in the year-earlier period.\n\nSales of a similar drug, Trulicity, missed expectations and tumbled 26% to $1.25 billion. Trulicity treats type 2 diabetes and, like the tirzepatide-based products, mimics the GLP-1 hormone to improve feelings of satiety and blood sugar markers.\n\nFor the year, Lilly expects $58 billion to $61 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $22.50 to $24 per share. The midpoints of Eli Lilly's outlook topped analysts' forecast. The Street projected $58.77 billion in sales and $22.76 earnings per share.\n\nEli Lilly Stock Analysis\n\nEli Lilly stock retook its 50-day moving average on Jan. 24 and topped its 200-day line on Feb. 6.\n\nShares are forming a cup base with a buy point at 972.53, according to MarketSurge.\n\nShares have an improving Relative Strength Rating of 83 out of a best-possible 99, IBD Digital shows. This puts LLY stock in the top 17% of all stocks when it comes to 12-month performance. The RS Rating was a middling 47 just three months ago.\n\nLilly stock also has a strong Composite Rating of 97, a measure of fundamental and technical metrics.\n\nRecent News Around Lilly Stock\n\nThe race to develop new weight-loss drugs continues to heat up.\n\nIn a recent study, Lilly's Zepbound topped Novo's Wegovy in the first-ever head-to-head study.\n\nParticipants with obesity and one other medical condition \u2014 but not diabetes \u2014 lost up to 20.2% of their body weight over 72 weeks. In comparison, Wegovy recipients lost 13.7% of their body weight. That translated to about 50 pounds and 33 pounds, respectively.\n\nLLY stock fell in July after Pfizer (PFE) and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) announced plans to run additional testing for obesity treatments. A weight-loss treatment study from Roche (RHHBY) also pressured Lilly shares.\n\nLilly is also working on a next-generation weekly shot called retatrutide. While tirzepatide loops in two hormonal targets to stoke weight loss, retatrutide targets three. Its oral weight-loss drug, dubbed orforglipron, is also expected to be the first weight-loss pill to hit the market.\n\nIn other news, Lilly's Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, gained FDA approval in July. It will sell under the brand name Kisunla.\n\nKisunla works by removing a built-up protein called beta amyloid. In testing, Kisunla worked better in patients whose amyloid included a protein called tau. Across all patients, donanemab slowed cognitive decline by 22% to 29% over 18 months. In patients with intermediate levels of tau, donanemab slowed the decline by 35% to 36%.\n\nIt rivals Biogen (BIIB) and Eisai's (ESAIY) Leqembi.\n\nIn the U.K., Kisunla is now approved for patients with one copy of a genetic mutation that makes them more susceptible to developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease or non-carriers. People with two copies of that mutation are more likely to experience brain swelling as a result amyloid removal.\n\nIs LLY Stock A Buy Or A Sell?\n\nEli Lilly stock isn't a buy\u2014 yet. But shares are setting up nicely, ahead of their key moving averages in a cup base.\n\nNotably, the company is benefitting from its deep investments in the obesity space, having recently won FDA approval for Zepbound as a sleep apnea treatment. Growth remains strong, in double- and triple-digit ranges for its sales and adjusted profit.\n\nIt will be key to watch how the markets for weight-loss drugs and Alzheimer's treatments unfold.\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy and watch, check out IBD Stock Lists.

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Wednesday, January 22, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), as well a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. (BDL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>> ) Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter. (You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+43.3% vs. +23.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects. Nonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model. Geographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.

            "content": "In a few short years, excitement about groundbreaking anti-obesity drugs made Novo Nordisk Europe\u2019s most highly valued company and Eli Lilly the biggest pharma group in the world. Just as quickly, investors are losing their appetite for the trade.\n\nAfter a disappointing trial of a new Novo Nordisk drug last month and lower-than-expected sales figures from Eli Lilly for two consecutive quarters, shares in both have come down from all-time highs.\n\nSome investors are also unconvinced that the market will be worth the $100bn plus by the end of the decade that analysts predict. The result for now is that Novo Nordisk is no longer the most valuable company in Europe, and anti-obesity specialists have entered bear market territory.\n\nSachin Jain from Bank of America points to the growth potential of the market as one of the main unknowns that worries investors. There\u2019s a \u201cbig debate\u201d, he said. \u201cIs [the market] $80bn across Novo and Lilly, or are we just having the wrong debate and the pie is a lot bigger? There\u2019s a huge range, no one knows what it could be.\u201d\n\nThe first of a new generation of GLP-1 drugs was approved for weight loss in the US in 2021, but lack of manufacturing capacity means demand outstripped supply from the start. This has made the size of the market and its growth potential much harder to judge.\n\nEven so, a plethora of biotechs have sprung up around the world to try to compete with the two big players. They hope to be able to design treatments that are easier to manufacture, more convenient to administer \u2014 the current options must be injected \u2014 and have fewer side effects, the most common ones being sickness and diarrhoea.\n\nPrivate investors have recently backed biotechs with exceptionally large funding rounds: Verdiva Bio and Kailera Therapeutics have raised more than $400mn each, while Metsera, which has filed for an IPO, secured $215mn in November. Big pharma companies are also rushing to buy anti-obesity drug candidates.\n\nBut the vast majority of these drugs are still many years from the market and although sales of existing drugs continue to grow, investors have become unnerved by the high valuations of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nEven after its shares fell 7 per cent in one day earlier this month, Eli Lilly is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 55. Novo Nordisk trades at a p/e of 27, despite a more than 21 per cent drop in its shares in one day late last year.\n\nOne healthcare investor who owns shares in Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly said both have been spending on big advertising campaigns in the US but have not had a corresponding sales growth spurt, making him worry about the potential of the market.\n\nHe added that external factors will also push down prices. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic, which respectively target weight loss and diabetes, were added to the Medicare negotiation list this month, making it likely the company will have to cut prices significantly in the US from 2027.\n\nThe weight-loss trade aside, healthcare shares have not kept up with a US market that is otherwise optimistic about the US economy.\n\nLinden Thomson, senior fund manager at Candriam, notes that weight-loss drugs have become the driver of healthcare investing. \u201cThe obesity opportunity is one that people can really understand and has been the main trade in the sector for quite a while. It is the AI equivalent of healthcare.\u201d\n\nAshley Oerth, associate global market strategist at Invesco, said the broader industry had been underperforming since the odds of Trump winning the US election swung in his favour in October.\n\nRobots transport packages and goods at Novo Nordisk\u2019s manufacturing facility in Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark \u00a9 Charlotte de la Fuente/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cI think a really important component is the Trump trade. We\u2019ve seen this expressed as a tilt towards more cyclical than defensive [shares], and healthcare is in the defensive bucket,\u201d she said.\n\nGareth Powell from fund manager Polar Capital, which owns shares in Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, said the sector had also been affected by worries about the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US health secretary. \u201cI think good news is not cheered significantly, and bad news is met with this huge sensitivity, and you\u2019re getting massive overreactions,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late December, Novo Nordisk announced that its much anticipated next-generation obesity drug CagriSema had missed its target for patients to lose 25 per cent of their body weight in a late-stage trial. The news wiped \u20ac90bn off the company\u2019s market capitalisation.\n\nThe results showed that patients on CagriSema could lose 23 per cent of their body weight on average. Unusually, participants had chosen their own dose. If more had taken the highest dose, the drug could well have hit the 25 per cent bar, according to several analysts and investors.\n\nCrucially, CagriSema had been seen as Novo Nordisk\u2019s opportunity to beat Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, which was approved in November 2023 and quickly won market share. Results published in December from a head-to-head trial run by Eli Lilly confirmed that Zepbound offered greater weight loss than Wegovy.\n\nPowell said if Novo Nordisk had run a more conventional trial, he believes it would have \u201csmashed 25 per cent\u201d. \u201cI think CagriSema is stronger and much more potent than Mounjaro,\u201d he said.\n\nEli Lilly still expects robust sales growth of up to 35% in 2025 but has conceded that the market is hard to predict \u00a9 Paulo Nunes dos Santos/Bloomberg\n\nInvestors will have to wait until later in the year for more data from the trial. This might explain why many patients did not increase their dose, with speculation in the market that this was because they were happy with the weight loss they had achieved or wary of experiencing more side effects. Novo Nordisk has also said it is planning a more conventionally designed trial.\n\nBut shareholders are not in a patient mood. Emily Field, an analyst at Barclays, said Novo Nordisk has a \u201ccredibility problem\u201d in relation to the CagriSema trial. \u201cThey made a gamble on this trial design \u2014 and lost,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made some unfortunate errors . . . and the market is being much more critical.\n\n\u201cI think people just come to the conclusion that [its] . . . advantage Lilly, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk declined to comment.\n\nShares in Eli Lilly rose on the CagriSema result but quickly gave up those gains. When it then missed its sales guidance last week, its shares fell 7 per cent in one day.\n\nSales of Mounjaro, the anti-diabetes version of Zepbound, were $3.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2024, missing a forecast for $4.4bn, while the figure for Zepbound was $1.9bn, below the average analyst estimate of $2.2bn.\n\nAt the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco this month, Eli Lilly chief executive David Ricks offered some explanations for the sales miss, including wholesalers trying to cut inventory.\n\nEli Lilly still expects robust sales growth of 28 per cent to 35 per cent in 2025 but has conceded that the market is hard to predict.\n\nThe healthcare investor concluded: \u201cThe easy money to be made has been made and now we\u2019re in this choppy dynamic. And then it doesn\u2019t help that suddenly Lilly can\u2019t guide properly. Nobody wants to own it right now.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other large-cap value stocks.\n\nWhy is this Portfolio Manager Cautiously Optimistic?\n\nThe market outlook is as uncertain as it gets. On January 18, Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, appeared in an interview on Wealth at Yahoo Finance to share his market outlook, which happens to be rather optimistic or \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nPavlik shared that as the new administration takes over he is optimistic about how the market will play out in the near future. He added that the new government is expected to do some deregulation and cut corporate taxes, which are supposedly going to boost earnings despite inflation being a concern. He also explained why he was cautious earlier. He stated that the easing cycle was more uncertain and the new government was emphasizing tariffs earlier, however, as time has passed, Pavlik has grown to become more optimistic about the market.\n\nHe also expects the economy to grow, suggesting that the US is nowhere near a recession. In addition to that, Pavlik is confident that valuations are expected to ease, tariffs seem to be a \u201cbargaining chip,\u201d and mass deportations are \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d In addition to that, he believes new energy policies to lower the price of oil and gas, resulting in lower costs incurred by firms across nearly every industry.\n\nBy the middle of 2025, Pavlik expects the Fed to be back issuing multiple rate cuts. Overall, he expects 2025 to be a solid year for equities, with expectations of the S&P 500 reaching 6,750, representing a 13-14% growth from January 18, 2025. While he agrees that in the near term, especially in the first 100 days of the new government, there are reasons to be slightly cautious, he remains confident that the new policies will work out as the market goes forward.\n\nSpeaking of inflation, Pavlik reiterated that the new energy policies will definitely push oil companies to produce more oil as a result of cost reductions. These cost reductions are expected to have a multiplier effect on grocery companies which will ultimately cater to inflationary pressures, added the portfolio manager. This coupled with his expectation of the Fed returning to its planned easing cycle will likely fuel shared investor sentiment and consumer confidence.\n\nWhile the first 100 days of the new administration may be uncertain and volatile, there are some stocks known to have been stable through rough or smooth market conditions. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 15 best large-cap value stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Finviz to look for companies operating in value sectors such as consumer defensive, financials, healthcare, and utilities. We only focused on companies with a market cap of more than $10 billion. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 15 stocks with the highest upside as of January 20, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nAnalyst Upside as of January 20, 2025: 38%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a pharmaceutical company that sells medicines for serious illnesses in 125 countries and has offices in 18. During the third quarter of 2024, the company received product approvals and launched new pipeline data for crucial drugs. The company\u2019s performance and growth trajectory coupled with its diverse portfolio of drugs and medicines contributes to its position on our list. Analysts are also bullish on the stock and their median price target implies an upside of 38% from current levels.\n\nOn January 15, Chris Schott, an analyst at JPMorgan, suggested that the Q4 miss puts forward a buying opportunity as LLY is positioned for robust growth in 2025. Schott added that the company\u2019s 2025 sales guidance is driven by its expanded label and growing geographic footprint. As a result, dosage sales of incretins are expected to grow by 60% year-over-year in the first half of 2025. The analyst also added that the Q4 miss is primarily due to an unexpected decline in wholesaler volumes and inventory. He maintained an overweight rating on the stock.\n\nThe stock also received a buy rating from Jefferies on January 15 and a buy from Bank of America Securities on January 21, 2025. LLY is positioned for tremendous growth, making it one of the best large-cap value stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 5th on our list of the best large-cap value stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "One of the hottest growth areas in the healthcare landscape these days is the obesity drug market because of a class of drugs that's proven to be both efficacious and safe in clinical studies and in the real world. You might be familiar with the top sellers, such as Eli Lilly's Zepbound or Novo Nordisk's Wegovy -- they've made headlines as demand for them soared.\n\nIn fact, demand for these drugs has been so strong that it even surpassed supply until the drugmakers took action to scale up manufacturing capacity -- and this may not let up. The obesity drug market may reach beyond $100 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley Research.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nAll of this has prompted investors to look for the next Lilly or Novo Nordisk -- a company that may join those giants in this high-growth market. Viking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) seems to fit the bill, as it announced fantastic data from trials of its weight loss candidate last February -- and the stock delivered a 116% gain for the full year.\n\nNow, as the obesity drug market opportunity remains strong, is Viking a buy in 2025?\n\nElli Lilly and Novo Nordisk weight loss drugs\n\nFirst, I'll talk about this class of drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. Novo Nordisk drugs are in the former category, while Lilly's are in the latter. In both cases, these drugs act on hormones involved in the digestion process, helping to reduce appetite and regulate blood sugar levels. They're easy to use, self-administered weekly, and have proven to help patients shed pounds.\n\nBoth of these drugs have seen enormous demand and brought in blockbuster revenue. Demand has been so high, that these drugs were on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) list of drugs that are in short supply. The FDA recently removed Lilly's treatment from the list after the company significantly ramped up manufacturing capacity, ensuring greater supply.\n\nNow let's talk about the new kid in town. Viking focuses on GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists and has a candidate, VK2735, in late-stage clinical trials. As an injectable (like the Novo Nordisk and Lilly commercialized drugs), VK2735 has completed phase 2, and the next step will be phase 3.\n\nIn phase 2, Viking's candidate showed up to a 14.7% reduction in mean body weight after 13 weeks. The company also is developing VK2735 in an oral tablet formulation, and that candidate just entered a phase 2 study. In an earlier trial, the oral candidate demonstrated weight loss of up to 8.2% after just 28 days.\n\nViking versus the market leaders\n\nSo is Viking a buy in 2025?\n\nIt's important to remember that Novo Nordisk and Lilly, as big pharma players, have the financial resources and infrastructure to remain in leadership positions in the weight loss drug market. They're profitable companies with full portfolios of products, and revenue has climbed over the years. Their market values top $300 billion and $600 billion, respectively, while Viking has a market cap of less than $4 billion.\n\nAll of this means it's unlikely Viking will upset the market's current leaders. That said, this newer biotech player could eventually carve out a spot if all continues to go well in clinical studies. As I mentioned earlier, weight loss drugs are in high demand, and this is expected to continue, so there's room for more than a couple of players in this space.\n\nViking's weight loss candidate won't reach commercialization as soon as this year -- but something else this year could boost the stock price -- promising clinical-trial data. Viking shares have been known to surge on strong clinical-trial results.\n\nWhen the company reported VK2735's phase 2 results last year, the stock jumped 121% in one trading session. Viking gave back some of those gains, but still finished the year, as mentioned above, with a triple-digit increase. And the solid results we've seen so far from Viking offer us reason to be optimistic about VK2735.\n\nThat said, anything can happen during a clinical trial, so investing in a biotech company that doesn't yet have products on the market involves some risk. But if you can accept that, scooping up shares of Viking could offer you great rewards -- down the line, and even as early as 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Viking Therapeutics wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company is a US-based multinational pharmaceutical company. It is the 12th largest pharmaceutical company by revenue and has offices in 16 countries. Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

            "content": "Two recent disappointing clinical trials of highly-anticipated weight-loss drugs have made it clear that it is too early to crown any winners in the race for the next generation of anti-obesity treatments.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) CagriSema and Amgen\u2019s (AMGN) MariTide both fell short of an expected 25% average weight-loss target in late-stage trials late last year, leaving investors frustrated and sending their stock prices tumbling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese setbacks have left the door wide open for other pharmaceutical companies racing to develop more potent weight-loss drugs. But it\u2019s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market.\n\nThese medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm \u2014 especially in the United States. Popularized by Ozempic, these treatments mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for their weight-loss effects. Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Zepbound.\n\nThe weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world\u2019s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years. Morgan Stanley (MS) projects the global market for these treatments could hit $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population \u2014 31.5 million people \u2014 are expected to be using them by 2035.\n\nWith that much money at stake, it\u2019s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaster weight loss with fewer injections and side effects\n\nSeveral pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections \u2014 an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound.\n\nNovo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication.\n\nEli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks.\n\n\u201cRetatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),\u201d president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a \u201cconvenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.\u201d\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nZealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea \u2014 one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can\u2019t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight.\n\nAn effective weight-loss pill\n\nPharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It\u2019s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results.\n\nEli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill \u2014 orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial \u2014 its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks.\n\nPfizer (PFE): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects.\n\nViking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking\u2019s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk\u2019s amycretin.",

Around one in eight Americans have taken GLP-1 medicines, popular prescription drugs used for weight loss, treating diabetes and to prevent heart attacks or strokes for adults with heart disease.\n\nResearchers at St Louis\u2019s Washington University established that the veterans taking the newer medicines faced a lower risk for 42 conditions and higher risk for 19.\n\nPeople taking the GLP-1 drugs showed a reduced risk of substance use and psychotic disorders, seizures, neurocognitive disorders (including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia), coagulation disorders, cardiometabolic disorders, infectious illnesses and several respiratory conditions.\n\nHowever, there was for instance an increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders, hypotension, syncope, arthritic disorders, nephrolithiasis, interstitial nephritis and drug-induced pancreatitis.\n\nIt comes after the outgoing Biden administration included Ozempic and Wegovy among its 15 prescription drugs slated for Medicare price negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, last week Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) said Cobenfy, its new schizophrenia drug, could be a multibillion-dollar success story in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIs LLY a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on LLY stock, based on 15 Buys and two Holds.

            "content": "Nobody could have predicted the vogue for GLP-1 drugs to promote weight loss. In the US alone, the number of patients starting GLP-1 treatments for nondiabetic purposes has increased by 700% since 2019, highlighting the popularity of these drugs beyond their original aim of treating Type 2 diabetes.\n\nYet the soaring enthusiasm for so-called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, first approved in 2005, overshadows an array of risks related to their off-label use. These include important environmental, social, and governance risks that investors must evaluate carefully since the environment is rapidly evolving. We talk about them below, but examples include:\n\nOff-label marketing risk\n\nSafety\n\nAffordability\n\nWe\u2019ll also show how to screen through the GLP-1 drug companies. When combining insights from Morningstar Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings and Morningstar Equity Research (depicted in Exhibit 1), we find that Pfizer PFE and Roche RHHBY stand out as potential top choices for investors among current and potential future market entrants.\n\nGLP-1 Drugs: Demand Surges in a Long-Established Market\n\nThe market for GLP-1 drugs is projected to exceed $200 billion in annual sales by 2031, according to Morningstar Equity Research. Current market leaders include Novo Nordisk NVO and Eli Lilly LLY with treatments such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound addressing both diabetes and obesity.\n\nStill, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are unlikely to have the obesity space to themselves for long. According to Morningstar Equity Research, several other players, including Pfizer, Roche, Amgen AMGN, AstraZeneca AZN, Zealand Pharma ZLDPF, Structure Therapeutics GPCR, and Altimmune ALT, are expected to join the GLP-1 space, with multiple drug launches expected between 2027 and 2032.\n\nAmong the key players set to enter the GLP-1 space, Pfizer has two products in phase 1 trials, whereas Roche has four products in the pipeline, with two products in phase 2 trials. Both companies could launch their first GLP-1 products as early as 2028, potentially making them strong competitors to current market leaders, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold: Issues and Risks Around GLP-1 Medications\n\nThe effectiveness of GLP-1 medications in promoting weight loss has led to a surge in off-label demand, particularly for cosmetic weight-loss purposes. This off-label use introduces several ESG-related issues, both for patients and the companies marketing these drugs. An ESG approach allows more in-depth research into risks that aren\u2019t captured by traditional financial analysis.\n\nOff-Label Marketing Risk\n\nManufacturers of GLP-1 medications may face regulatory scrutiny and legal risks if they promote their products for off-label use or disseminate inaccurate and misleading information. That raises substantial concerns for these companies and their investors. Such practices could trigger investigations into their promotional activities or legal action from consumers, sparking lengthy legal proceedings and operational disruptions. All these could pose significant financial burdens on the companies involved.\n\nSafety Concerns and Liability Issues for GLP-1 Drugs\n\nGLP-1 medications, like all other pharmaceuticals, carry safety challenges, including the risk of adverse side effects. Chronic use of any medication can increase the likelihood of adverse side effects due to prolonged exposure. While patients living with chronic life-threatening conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, may accept these risks, people using GLP-1 drugs for less life-threatening and severe purposes may be less forgiving if the side effects outweigh the perceived benefits.\n\nConsequently, people using GLP-1 medications for weight loss may litigate more readily over unanticipated or adverse side effects. This exposes manufacturers to potentially heightened liability risks, particularly in the US, where a litigious culture increases the risk and financial impact of legal challenges.\n\nAccess, Affordability, and Pricing Risks for GLP-1 Medications\n\nPerceived excessive and unjustified price increases, as well as regional cost disparities, have sparked public debate and criticism over companies\u2019 pricing strategies for their GLP-1 medications. That creates significant regulatory risks for companies. For instance, at the start of 2024, the US list prices of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) and Mounjaro (Eli Lilly) increased by 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, bringing their monthly cost to $979 and $1,069.\n\nThese price hikes are part of a broader conversation surrounding the cost disparities between the US and other regions. A congressional hearing in September 2024 raised concerns over the stark price differences between the US and the European Union for similar medications. For example, Ozempic is priced at approximately $1,000 per month in the US, versus around \u20ac89 in Germany.\n\nPricing is intensifying public debate and scrutiny surrounding these medications. That\u2019s likely to grow. Morningstar Equity Research predicts that Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy will be subject to Medicare price negotiations (as part of the Inflation Reduction Act) starting in 2027.\n\nHow to Screen GLP-1 Drug Manufacturers\n\nWhich current and future GLP-1 manufacturers may be best positioned to navigate these risks? One helpful tool is Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Rating, which offers valuable insights into companies\u2019 exposure to material ESG issues and evaluates their strategies to address such risks. By combining this information with Morningstar Equity Research\u2019s fair value estimate, which compares a company\u2019s current market price to its estimated intrinsic value, investors can identify opportunities that align with both financial and ESG objectives.\n\nAs for companies entering the GLP-1 space, investors should look at the material ESG issues of Product Governance, which assesses how companies ensure the safety and quality of their products as well as market their products according to their label, and Access to Basic Services, which focuses on how companies make their products accessible and affordable.\n\nNotes: Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics Inc., and Zealand Pharma A/S are assigned Morningstar Quantitative Moat Ratings, with all companies rated \u2605\u2605\u2605. For the ESG Risk Rating, Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, and Zealand Pharma A/S hold Morningstar Sustainalytics Core Ratings, with scores of 37.1, 26.5, and 26.7, respectively. Structure Therapeutics Inc. is not currently rated by Sustainalytics. Source: Morningstar Direct & Morningstar Sustainalytics, Ordered by star rating\n\nCombining insights from the ESG Risk Rating and Morningstar Equity Research, we find that Pfizer and Roche stand out as potential top choices among the companies either currently in the GLP-1 space or those poised to enter.\n\nBoth are rated 5 stars by Morningstar Equity Research and show strong management of key ESG issues, namely Product Governance and Access to Basic Services. These strengths position them well to navigate the complexities of the GLP-1 space while addressing associated ESG risks.\n\nMeanwhile, current market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly appear to present higher levels of unmanaged ESG risks. Novo Nordisk displays average management of Product Governance risks, and both companies showcase average management of Access to Basic Services. Further, both firms are trading at less attractive 3-star and 2-star valuation levels compared with Pfizer and Roche, given potential headwinds such as insurance difficulties, pricing pressures, and new competition.\n\nNevertheless, Pfizer\u2019s and Roche\u2019s success within the GLP-1 space will depend on many factors, including the outcomes of clinical trials, advancements in drug pipelines, demonstrated efficacy and safety of their candidates, and effective strategies for commercialization and market access.\n\nGLP-1 Drugmakers: Looking Into the Future\n\nAs the GLP-1 market matures, ESG risks could decline. Here\u2019s why. Beginning in 2027, GLP-1 prices could fall 10%-15% a year on average, mirroring trends observed in other drugs, according to Morningstar Equity Research These price declines reflect heightened competition and regulatory pressures. In turn, these stresses might address concerns about access and affordability. Similarly, enhanced safety profiles, such as potentially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, for the next generation of GLP-1 drugs could lessen patient liability risks.\n\nSuch developments will require investors to further navigate the current and future landscapes of ESG risks for GLP-1 medications.\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Stocks That Could Split in the Near Future. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly And Co. (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that could split in the near future.\n\nStock splits don\u2019t change how much a company is worth, but they make each share cheaper and easier for people to buy, considering it\u2019s a forward split. Stock splits can vary from a simple 2-for-1 split to a larger 100-for-1 split or more. In a 2-for-1 split, each share is turned into two new shares. This makes each share half the price, but the total value of the company remains the same. For example, if a share costs $100, after a 2-for-1 split, you\u2019ll have two shares that cost $50 each. This can make it easier to buy shares and attract more people to invest. Even though the share price goes down, the total amount of money paid out to shareholders stays the same. Hence, splitting shares doesn\u2019t change how much control existing shareholders have in the company. The main goal is to make the company\u2019s stock more appealing to investors. There\u2019s no proof that stock splits make a company better, but they can make investors feel more positive about the company. But with these benefits come the costs and risks. The process requires legal work and can be expensive.\n\nSplitting a stock doesn\u2019t change a good company into a bad one or vice versa. The price might go up a bit after the split, but it won\u2019t change the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals. Sometimes, a low stock price can actually look bad for a big company. Still, many companies practice splitting stocks if their share prices are growing too high.\n\n2025 Outlook\n\nOn January 16, Mark Newton, Fundstrat Global head of technical strategy, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on CNBC to discuss that the long-term market trends look positive. The market initially experienced a cooler-than-expected jump, but concerns were raised about the breadth of the market and the potential impact of interest rates on small-cap stocks. Mark Newton expressed a constructive view but noted that the market\u2019s breadth had deteriorated significantly, with only about 25% of stocks currently above their 50-day moving average. This decline was particularly evident in sectors like healthcare, where seven sectors lost more than 4% in the last month.\n\nDespite these challenges, Newton highlighted that technology stocks had rebounded, helping to keep indices afloat and maintaining long-term trends. However, he noted that near-term sentiment had become pessimistic regarding the potential policies of the president-elect, which added to market uncertainty. He maintained his target for the S&P 500 at 6650, suggesting that interest rates might begin to roll over in the coming months, which could be bullish for equities given their recent correlation with treasury yields.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top stocks trading over $400 as of January 19. We then selected the 20 stocks with high surges in their share prices in the past 5 years and a history of splitting stocks. From that, we picked the top 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (NYSE:LLY)\n\nShare Price as of January 19: $725.72\n\nSurge in Share Price in 5 Years: 419.93%\n\nStock Split Confirmed: No\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and markets human medications. The company\u2019s growth is mainly driven by the increasing demand for weight loss and diabetes treatments. It has a strong pipeline of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist drugs. This means that it helps manage diabetes and weight by affecting certain hormones in the body.\n\nIn FQ4 2024, the company\u2019s weight-loss drug sales fell short, with Mounjaro revenue at $3.5 billion (vs. the $5.35 billion estimate) and Zepbound at $1.9 billion (vs. the $2.08 billion estimate). This was due to slower-than-expected US demand and low inventories. However, the company expects 2025 revenue of $58 billion to $61 billion, surpassing analysts\u2019 estimate of $58.52 billion. Despite recent stock declines, Eli Lilly And Co. (NYSE:LLY) is up 16% over the past year.\n\nDespite this, Eli Lilly And Co. (NYSE:LLY) is still on track for 32% annual revenue growth in 2025. With its oncology business growing and treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s and eczema yet to reach full scale, the dip in stock price offers a potentially good investment opportunity. The company is also investing $1.8 billion to expand its manufacturing facilities in Limerick and Kinsale, Ireland. These are efforts to meet the growing demand for incretin therapeutics and produce Kisunla, its newly approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment.\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that could split in the near future. While we acknowledge the growth potential of LLY, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Eli Lilly has signed up to use ViaNautis' proprietary polyNaut platform for the development of new genetic medicines. According to ViaNautis, the platform can enhance the design and delivery of polymer-based systems to facilitate intracellular transport of nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA. Effective delivery remains a critical hurdle in advancing genetic medicines to clinical and commercial stages. Lilly will be looking to use the technology to address the delivery challenges associated with genetic therapies. To find out more, we spoke with ViaNautis\u2019 CEO Adi Hoess.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind ViaNautis?\n\n\n\nTargeted polymer-based nanovesicles offer a new dimension in the therapy of many diseases where a lack of specific targeting limits efficacy or can lead to safety issues. The concept of creating target-specific nanovesicles capable of carrying small molecules, antibodies, or genetic medicines, was pioneered by Guiseppe Battaglia\u2019s group over 20 years ago.\n\nIn 2018, ViaNautis was spun out of University College London (UCL) and co-founded by Battaglia, Francesca Crawford, and Denis Cecchin, a long-term researcher in Battaglia\u2019s lab. The company was founded on key patents from Battaglia\u2019s lab, which were exclusively licensed to ViaNautis, along with proprietary knowledge on generating its innovative polymer nanovesicle platform, polyNaut.\n\nSince its inception, the company has achieved significant growth. In late 2023, the company closed a $25 million Series A financing round led by investors including 4BIO Capital, BGF, and UCB Ventures, with additional support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and Eli Lilly and Company. Existing investors including Origin Capital, Meltwind and O2H also participated.\n\nWe\u2019ve also rapidly expanded the team, now employing over 35 staff members. Recent strategic appointments include Steven M. Altschuler as Chairman, Adi Hoess as Chief Executive Officer, and Ray Jupp as Chief Scientific Officer.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the story behind this collaboration?\n\n\n\nThe need for precise delivery in genetic medicines presents a tremendous opportunity to expand treatment options across a range of challenging diseases. ViaNautis\u2019 polyNaut platform has demonstrated the potential for targeted delivery of genetic medicines to specific tissues, including across the blood brain barrier as pertains to CNS diseases, a breakthrough achievement. This success has sparked interest with leading pharmaceutical companies, ultimately leading to the partnership with Lilly.\n\nWhat are you allowed to tell us about how your nanovesicles work?\n\n\n\nThe polyNaut platform is built on nano-engineered polymer technology specifically designed for targeted intracellular delivery. We have identified and developed polymers that can be synthesized at scale and that are compatible with the attachment of targeting ligands. These ligands recognize specific receptors on cells, enabling precise targeting.\n\nOur nanovesicles are composed of a carefully selected polymer, either left uncoupled or coupled with ligands through efficient chemistry processes. A key advantage of our polymer-based approach is that the nanovesicles are formed through processes that result in high quality nanovesicles with exceptionally low polydispersity. A further advantage is that polymer-based nanovesicles do not form a protein corona, which allows them to evade non-specific liver uptake \u2013 a common limitation in conventional delivery platforms. Additionally, our nanovesicles have shown stability at 4\u00b0C, making them easier to store and distribute compared to other technologies that require freezing.\n\nUnlike many current delivery platforms, our nanovesicles have demonstrated no immune response to date. This is a critical advantage as immune reactions are a common obstacle for many delivery technologies \u2013 specifically with adeno associated virus (AAV) where re-dosing is not possible because of the formation of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nWe believe that our polyNaut technology is highly adaptable, allowing for the encapsulation of a wide range of payloads, from small molecules to genetic materials. We refer to it as a 'bionic nanoparticle.' Its unique polymer structure supports the delivery of genetic cargoes with sizes that surpass the limits of both viral and non-viral delivery systems. To achieve therapeutic efficacy, polyNaut nanovesicles use our proprietary GoTo technology, which enables the efficient intracellular shuttling of these encapsulated molecules to the sites of transcription or translation as applicable.\n\nWhat are the challenges of delivering genetic medicines?\n\n\n\nAdvances in genetic nanomedicines are hindered by the inefficiency of delivering genetic materials across biological barriers to reach specific sites of action. These barriers often prevent genetic therapies from being as effective as they could be, leading patients to have to compromise on treatments with limited efficacy or undesirable side effects. Traditional delivery methods, such as AAV and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), face notable limitations: lack of cell specificity, payload inflexibility, suboptimal safety profiles and complex manufacturing processes.\n\nWhy do you think your nanovesicles can do better than other approaches?\n\n\n\nI believe that our technology has great potential to make a significant impact on the genetic nanomedicine delivery space. Our nanovesicles precisely target specific tissues and cell types of interest, including difficult-to-reach areas (such as through the blood brain barrier) and by avoiding endosomal trapping through our proprietary phenotypic targeting approach which is tailored and controlled.\n\nPolyNaut\u2018s precision phenotypic targeting is driven by two key attributes: barcoding (multivalent low affinity binding)-ligand-mediated interaction, which allows precise targeting of unique cell receptor signatures \u2013 and polymer brush peptide ligands around nanovesicles which enables binding energy control for precise interaction with target ligands.\n\nOur nanovesicles enable highly controlled, efficient and effective endosomal release of the cargo into the cytoplasm through engineered disassembly of the polymer nanovesicle.",

Novo Nordisk markets its semaglutide medicines as Ozempic pre-filled pens and Rybelsus oral tablets for type II diabetes (T2D) and Wegovy injections for weight management.\n\nAny price reduction resulting from the impending negotiations will become effective in 2027. For continued coverage of its semaglutide medicines under Medicare, NVO has until Feb. 28, 2025, to decide if it will participate in negotiations or pay a large tax on U.S. sales of the drugs. Either way, investors anticipate a decline in the company's profit margins resulting in the stock price decline. The Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs to make them more affordable for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nMedicare stated that, from November 2023 to October 2024, approximately 5.3 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries used these 15 selected drugs to treat conditions like cancer, T2D and asthma. During the same period, these drugs accounted for around $41 billion, or 14%, of the total gross covered prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D.\n\nIn the past three months, Novo Nordisk\u2019s shares have plunged 32.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 16.6% decline.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that shares of NVO\u2019s archrival in the obesity space, Eli Lilly LLY, also declined 4.2% on Friday, although none of its drugs were selected for the second round of price negotiations. Eli Lilly markets its tirzepatide medicines, Mounjaro for T2D and Zepbound for obesity, which competes with NVO\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy. The fall in LLY\u2019s stock price is likely because investors also anticipate the selection of its tirzepatide medicines by Medicare for price negotiations in the future.\n\nIn 2023, Medicare selected 10 drugs for its first round of price negotiations.

            "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Popular GLP-1 medications approved for weight loss, diabetes, and heart disease may have untapped potential to treat substance abuse disorders, psychosis, infections, cancer, and dementia, a sweeping new study shows.\n\nThe research also points to important and perhaps underappreciated risks of these drugs. These risks primarily involved the digestive system and included nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn and gastroparesis, or stomach paralysis. Beyond the gut, people who took GLP-1 medications were also more likely to be diagnosed with problems in their bones and joints, like arthritis and tendinitis, compared with people taking other medications to manage their blood sugar.\n\nOut of 175 different outcomes researchers included in the study, they found people who took GLP-1 medications had lower risks of 42 different health outcomes and higher risks for 19. Some of the biggest risk reductions were for shock, aspiration pneumonia, liver failure, lung failure and cardiac arrest.\n\nThough they found more benefits associated with the GLP-1 drugs than risks, study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System, said people shouldn\u2019t take that as an unconditional green light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a blanket recommendation, because the side effects are real,\u201d Al-Aly said. \u201cI think people should have a conversation with their practitioners or their doctor or provider and do their own individualized risk benefit analysis,\u201d he said.\n\nThough people have shared personal stories of the medications\u2019 sometimes surprising side effects, such as pregnancy, and individual studies have hinted at new benefits and risks, there have been few studies that have been able to take a comprehensive look at how these medications, which include Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, may change a person\u2019s overall health.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, is one of the first big-picture looks at the benefits and risks of these new drugs, which rapidly made an impact on health care, insurance coverage, the grocery industry, and even the economy of an entire country (Denmark, where Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy is based.) These drugs have also been given partial credit for a recent dip in obesity rates in the US, which dropped in 2023 for the first time in over a decade.\n\nFor the investigation, a team led by Al-Aly sifted through the records of nearly 2 million people with diabetes who were treated by the Veterans Health Administration for an average of almost four years between October 2017 and the end of December 2023.\n\nIt compared nearly 216,000 people who were prescribed GLP-1 medications to people prescribed three other kinds of medications to lower their blood sugar, as well as those who enrolled in the system with diabetes who continued to take the medications they had already been prescribed without any changes to their therapy, meaning they didn\u2019t start a new drug during this time. All told, the study utilized the medical histories of 2.4 million people.\n\nAl-Aly used these records to build what he calls \u201can atlas of association,\u201d or a wide-ranging picture of the risks and benefits of the drugs throughout the body.\n\nOthers said the study was helpful in thinking about the medications on a larger scale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting study,\u201d said Dr. Scott Butsch, who is director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis paper extends our current knowledge of the effectiveness of this class of medications.\u201d\n\nWeighing benefits and risks\n\nThe greatest risk increases were seen for nausea and vomiting, kidney stones, gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, sleep disturbances, and non-infectious gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the digestive tract that can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.\n\nThe increased risk of nausea and vomiting will probably not come as a surprise to anyone who has taken these medications. The increased risk of kidney stones, on the other hand, might be less familiar.\n\n\u201cThat may be related to the possibility that people, when they are on GLP-1, they definitely eat a whole lot less to lose weight, but they also hydrate themselves less,\u201d Al-Aly said in a news briefing. \u201cPerhaps that chronic dehydration leads to increased risk of stones.\u201d\n\nThe drugs also appeared to be linked to kidney benefits, too. There were decreased risks that a person might experience chronic kidney disease and urinary tract infections.\n\nThe study has several important caveats. First, most of the patients whose records were used for the study were older, White and male, which is typical of the population served by the VA health system.\n\nOn average, people in the study were over age 65, more than 70% were White, and more than 92% were men, so the study results may not apply to other types of GLP-1 users. And everyone in the study had diabetes, so no one was taking these medications solely for weight loss. While diabetes and obesity pose many of the same risks to the body, they aren\u2019t exactly the same, so it\u2019s hard to know whether that also influenced the results.\n\nFor example, the study found GLP-1 users had a 7% greater risk of developing gastroparesis compared with people who were using other types of medications to lower their blood sugar. But having diabetes also puts a person at increased risk for developing gastroparesis, so it\u2019s difficult to know if the risks would look the same for people who don\u2019t have the condition.\n\nBut these kinds of studies are very good at generating new research questions \u2014 like why would medication that helps people lose weight be associated with an increased risk of arthritis, as this study showed?\n\nThe study is also observational, which means it can\u2019t prove cause and effect. Very often in medicine, observational studies find that two things often happen at the same time \u2014 for example, countries with high chocolate consumption produce more Nobel prize winners per capita. But that doesn\u2019t mean eating chocolate makes you smarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of almost like a road map for future studies, but it also gives me confirmation of some of the hunches I\u2019ve had, and maybe it might affect some of my decision making with patients,\u201d said Dr. Melanie Jay, who studies the treatment and prevention of obesity at NYU Langone Health. She was not involved in the research.\n\nImprovements seem related reductions in fat and inflammation\n\nAl-Aly said when he looks at his results, he thinks the drugs probably act via two different pathways. One relates to the reduction in obesity and the risks that go with that. The other has to do with reducing inflammation.\n\nHe said there\u2019s also appears to be an effect in the brain, which has GLP-1 receptors, and in the lining of the blood vessels.\n\nSome of the most pronounced brain benefits found in the study related to reduced risks for psychosis and schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cI was surprised. Like, why would they work in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders?\u201d Al-Aly said. He was surprised, when he searched the medical literature, that this finding hadn\u2019t come out of the blue. There have been some studies suggesting that GLP-1 medications reduce symptoms of schizophrenia in animals.\n\nThe drugs were linked to small reduction \u2014 12% \u2014 in the risk of dementia and other neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Al-Aly thinks that might be an underestimate because even though the study followed huge numbers of people, it covered only about four years, so they might have seen more Alzheimer\u2019s cases if the study had gone on for longer, which might have translated to a larger benefit.\n\nThere were other benefits seen in the brain, too. GLP-1 drugs also seemed to reduce a person\u2019s risk for seizures and bleeding strokes. As some people have already noticed, the drugs appear to cut the risk for some substance use disorders, including addictions to opioids, alcohol, stimulants and sedatives.\n\nMore research needed\n\nJay said she had hoped to see more information around eating disorders, including binge-eating disorder. The drugs famously turn off what users call \u201cfood noise\u201d or intrusive thoughts of food. The study did show a reduction in bulimia, or binge-eating with purging, but didn\u2019t contain any information specifically about binge-eating disorder, where people don\u2019t purge, or anorexia, where people restrict calories. There have been anecdotal reports that GLP-1 medications may contribute to anorexia by blunting hunger cues for people who\u2019ve developed an unhealthy aversion to food.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few patients with bulimia, and it\u2019s not certain whether it would be safe or not to put them on it,\u201d Jay said. \u201cBut the fact that it, like, is associated with an improvement would make me a little bit feel a little bit better about putting someone on that medicine if they have bulimia, as long as I\u2019m following them closely,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd contrary to some fears that GLP-1 medications might increase the risk of depression and suicidality, as other weight loss drugs have in the past, this study found that these newer medications were linked to a lower risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and the intention to self-harm.\n\nAnother surprising link had to do with aspiration pneumonia, or the risk that someone might vomit and some of that undigested food might get into their lungs and cause an infection. Anesthesiologists have been especially concerned about this risk after discovering patients on GLP-1 medications have gone into surgeries with lots of food left in their stomachs, which puts them at risk for this complication.\n\nThe new study found a lower risk for aspiration pneumonia in patients taking GLP-1 medications, compared with people who didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut here it is, and you\u2019re looking at a VA population, which is usually an older, sicker population, and you\u2019re seeing actually potentially decreased risks,\u201d of aspiration pneumonia, Butsch said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the drugs might be tied to that decreased risk, however, and this might be one of those outcomes that needs further study.\n\nThe study showed people taking GLP-1 drugs also had lower risks of some kinds of infections including pneumonia, sepsis and bacterial infections. They were also less likely than those taking other medications to experience some kinds of clotting disorders like pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis.\n\nAl-Aly said he was inspired to do the study by the story of statin drugs, like Lipitor, which are prescribed to treat high cholesterol. After those were introduced, studies began to suggest they, too, had benefits which extended beyond their use in preventing heart attacks and strokes, such as lowering the risk of some types of cancer and perhaps protecting the brain from dementia.\n\nHe said studies like this one weren\u2019t possible when those drugs first became available, but he thinks the role of big data in getting a wider look at what drugs might do, is important to consider.\n\nWhile all of these potential benefits are exciting, experts said they need much more study, and even then, whether they might ever be utilized as a treatment for schizophrenia, for example, would depend on a number of factors: how much and how consistently they work, as well as how they compare to treatments that are already available. There\u2019s at least one study underway to try to answer some of those questions.\n\nOther studies are also testing to see whether drugs like Ozempic might be helpful in the setting of substance abuse.",

            "content": "In the first half of 2024, it seemed Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) could do no wrong. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last very long. The stock peaked last October and was down by more than 21% when the market closed on Jan. 16.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a good stock to buy on the dip? Here's a look at why it's been beaten down lately to find out.\n\nWhy Eli Lilly stock is under pressure\n\nThe latest declines in Eli Lilly's stock price occurred in response to management's presentation at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare conference. On Jan. 14, CEO David Ricks told investors that 2024 sales would come in at about $45 billion. That's about 32% more than it reported during the previous year, but less than he told us to expect a few short months ago.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Lilly told investors to expect 2024 revenue to land in a range between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. Sales of the company's diabetes and weight loss treatments are soaring but not quite as fast as the company anticipated in the first half of last year.\n\nSales of Eli Lilly's lead drug, tirzepatide, which it markets as Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes, leapt up to a combined $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter. That's some amazing growth for a drug that launched in 2022.\n\nReasons to hang on to Eli Lilly stock\n\nCompounding pharmacies such as Hims & Hers Health producing their own versions of tirzepatide likely pressured demand for Eli Lilly's branded version in the second half of 2024. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows compounding pharmacies to step in when there's a drug shortage.\n\nRecently built manufacturing centers finally ended the shortage on Dec. 19. Now that Lilly's the only company selling tirzepatide again, forecasting sales growth could be much easier. Also, on Dec. 20, the FDA approved Zepbound to treat obstructive sleep apnea, which could boost demand to new heights.\n\nAbout a year from now, Lilly could cement its lead in the weight loss medication market. According to Ricks, the company expects approval of an oral weight-loss pill called orforglipron in early 2026. In a phase 2 study, treatment with the oral GLP-1 drug reduced patients' weight by 14.7% after just 36 weeks.\n\nIn addition to diabetes and weight loss treatments, Eli Lilly is a big player in the oncology and immunology spaces. Last September, the FDA approved Ebglyss for the treatment of eczema. With less frequent dosing, Ebglyss is expected to compete fiercely with Dupixent, a treatment that racked up over $13 billion in sales last year.\n\nOn Jan. 15, the FDA approved Lilly's Omvoh for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In the Vivid-1 trial with patients who didn't respond well to previous drugs, Omvoh helped a majority achieve clinical remission. It probably won't happen overnight, but sales of this treatment could grow past $2 billion annually in a few years.\n\nLast July, Lilly's Alzheimer's disease candidate Kisunla earned approval from the FDA to treat Alzheimer's disease. Intended for early-stage patients with mild cognitive impairment, annual sales of the monthly infusion are expected to top out above $7 billion.\n\nBuy, sell, or hold?\n\nAt recent prices, you can buy shares of Eli Lilly for about 33.5 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a steep valuation for an established pharmaceutical company.\n\nIf you consider how quickly Lilly's sales and earnings could grow, 33.5 times earnings expectations is a bargain. At the midpoint of management's guidance range, top-line sales are expected to soar by 32% in 2025.\n\nWith Zepbound, Ebglyss, Kisunla, Omvoh, and possibly orforglipron contributing to growth, this established pharmaceutical giant could grow sales and its bottom line by a double-digit annual percentage for the next several years. With this in mind, now isn't the time to be worried. Holding the stock and buying some more shares looks like a smart move for most investors.",

Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nBelow, I'm going to dive into what caused Lilly's stock to drop earlier this week and assess if the current price action is a good opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nWhat caused Eli Lilly's stock to fall this week?\n\nDuring an earnings report, management will generally provide investors with a forecast for the next quarter and potentially the full year. This is a process known as financial guidance. Guidance is important because it ultimately serves as a way for investors to hold management accountable should the financial picture and operating results start to get off track.\n\nBack in October, Lilly reported earnings for the third quarter. During this report, management provided revenue guidance for the full year 2024 in the range of $45.4 billion to $46 billion. This was nominally below management's prior guidance range -- which signaled total sales of $46.6 billion at the high end.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Lilly surprised investors with another revision to its full-year guidance. Per the company's press release, Lilly now expects to generate $45 billion in sales for 2024 -- a decrease from the lower range of its prior forecast.\n\nNaturally, this was unwelcome news, and investors punished Lilly by selling off its stock.\n\nHow big of a deal is this guidance miss?\n\nI don't mean to overgeneralize, but companies miss guidance all of the time. Missing guidance in and of itself is not a reason to panic. What's more important is why a business is not performing at the level it thought it would. Once those details are uncovered, it becomes much easier to assess whether a company indeed has problems or if it's simply experiencing a temporary bump in the road.\n\nAs for Eli Lilly's situation at the moment, it's important to remember that the company is still on pace to grow annual revenue by 32%. As an investor in Lilly myself, I can't turn my back on a company growing at this pace.\n\nI think what really caused the recent sell-off was Lilly's specific guidance related to its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. For the fourth quarter, Lilly calls for revenue of $3.5 billion for Mounjaro and $1.9 billion for Zepbound.\n\nConsidering that these two treatments are Lilly's biggest tailwinds, it's easy to connect the dots between the company's lower sales estimate and the acceleration at which Mounjaro and Zepbound are moving.\n\nBut here's the subtle idea I think most investors are overlooking.

            "content": "In the first half of 2024, it seemed Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) could do no wrong. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last very long. The stock peaked last October and was down by more than 21% when the market closed on Jan. 16.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a good stock to buy on the dip? Here's a look at why it's been beaten down lately to find out.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nWhy Eli Lilly stock is under pressure\n\nThe latest declines in Eli Lilly's stock price occurred in response to management's presentation at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare conference. On Jan. 14, CEO David Ricks told investors that 2024 sales would come in at about $45 billion. That's about 32% more than it reported during the previous year, but less than he told us to expect a few short months ago.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Lilly told investors to expect 2024 revenue to land in a range between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. Sales of the company's diabetes and weight loss treatments are soaring but not quite as fast as the company anticipated in the first half of last year.\n\nSales of Eli Lilly's lead drug, tirzepatide, which it markets as Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for diabetes, leapt up to a combined $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter. That's some amazing growth for a drug that launched in 2022.\n\nReasons to hang on to Eli Lilly stock\n\nCompounding pharmacies such as Hims & Hers Health producing their own versions of tirzepatide likely pressured demand for Eli Lilly's branded version in the second half of 2024. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows compounding pharmacies to step in when there's a drug shortage.\n\nRecently built manufacturing centers finally ended the shortage on Dec. 19. Now that Lilly's the only company selling tirzepatide again, forecasting sales growth could be much easier. Also, on Dec. 20, the FDA approved Zepbound to treat obstructive sleep apnea, which could boost demand to new heights.\n\nAbout a year from now, Lilly could cement its lead in the weight loss medication market. According to Ricks, the company expects approval of an oral weight-loss pill called orforglipron in early 2026. In a phase 2 study, treatment with the oral GLP-1 drug reduced patients' weight by 14.7% after just 36 weeks.\n\nIn addition to diabetes and weight loss treatments, Eli Lilly is a big player in the oncology and immunology spaces. Last September, the FDA approved Ebglyss for the treatment of eczema. With less frequent dosing, Ebglyss is expected to compete fiercely with Dupixent, a treatment that racked up over $13 billion in sales last year.\n\nOn Jan. 15, the FDA approved Lilly's Omvoh for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In the Vivid-1 trial with patients who didn't respond well to previous drugs, Omvoh helped a majority achieve clinical remission. It probably won't happen overnight, but sales of this treatment could grow past $2 billion annually in a few years.\n\nLast July, Lilly's Alzheimer's disease candidate Kisunla earned approval from the FDA to treat Alzheimer's disease. Intended for early-stage patients with mild cognitive impairment, annual sales of the monthly infusion are expected to top out above $7 billion.\n\nBuy, sell, or hold?\n\nAt recent prices, you can buy shares of Eli Lilly for about 33.5 times forward-looking earnings expectations. That's a steep valuation for an established pharmaceutical company.\n\nIf you consider how quickly Lilly's sales and earnings could grow, 33.5 times earnings expectations is a bargain. At the midpoint of management's guidance range, top-line sales are expected to soar by 32% in 2025.\n\nWith Zepbound, Ebglyss, Kisunla, Omvoh, and possibly orforglipron contributing to growth, this established pharmaceutical giant could grow sales and its bottom line by a double-digit annual percentage for the next several years. With this in mind, now isn't the time to be worried. Holding the stock and buying some more shares looks like a smart move for most investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently emphasized the importance of long-term investing, urging investors to focus on the growth prospects of certain pharmaceutical stocks while also answering callers\u2019 questions about certain stocks. Cramer acknowledged that stocks often experience cyclical trends, with some sectors falling out of favor temporarily.\n\n\u201cLook, stocks go in and out of style in the Wall Street fashion show. Whole sectors wallow at times. Right now, healthcare\u2019s in some sort of doghouse the likes of which I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks\n\nDespite the industry\u2019s struggles, Cramer reflected on his observations at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, where he saw many pharmaceutical companies that he believes are not being properly valued by Wall Street. While the present outlook for these companies may not be particularly stellar, he highlighted the strong and lucrative long-term potential they offer.\n\n\u201cWhy am I so willing to focus on the so-called out years? Because the long-term possibilities for these companies, frankly, they\u2019re incredible and by the way, incredibly lucrative too, even as the present is good, but not great.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the ongoing progress in the healthcare sector, particularly with GLP-1 drugs, which have the potential to treat more conditions beyond diabetes and weight loss. Additionally, companies are working on developing oral versions of these treatments, which could offer patients more convenient options. Beyond GLP-1 drugs, healthcare companies are expanding their portfolios with new cancer therapies, treatments for eye care and asthma, and experimental drugs for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line: Ask yourself what happens if things get better, please. What if the future is brighter than the past? If that\u2019s the case, and I think it is, then you\u2019ll have a lot of winners with these drug and medical device plays.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on January 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nWhile talking about a leading global pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Cramer said:\n\n\u201cI want to start with a stock that got pummeled today. Eli Lilly, pulverized. Here\u2019s a company that pre-announced $58 to $61 billion in revenue next year, substantially better than expected on the back of those GLP-1 drugs, approved for diabetes, weight loss, and now obstructive sleep apnea. There\u2019s just one problem here. Lilly\u2019s fourth-quarter estimates, the fourth quarter that we just finished, they aren\u2019t as strong as Wall Street was hoping.\u201d\n\nCramer noted that the company had a volatile recently, moving from the top of the S&P 500 to the bottom, where it ended up on Tuesday. He pointed out that, despite the company\u2019s large presence, its performance that day was so poor that it lagged behind the other 499 companies in the index. Cramer acknowledged the disappointment but remained somewhat unfazed by the drop, explaining to viewers of his CNBC Investing Club that he sees this as an opportunity.\n\n\u201cSee, I\u2019m thinking that Lilly\u2019s wonder drug Mounjaro, also known as Zepbound, has way too many potential indications to write it off because of one subpar quarter. This drug, I believe, will work against hypertension, known as the silent killer, heart failure, complicated liver disease, joints, dementia, and yes, heavy drinking. It has so many uses that Lilly\u2019s spending $20 billion to build out manufacturing so it can meet the demand even though there\u2019s a very capable competitor, Novo Nordisk, and there are a lot of companies trying to get into space.\u201d\n\nCramer pointed out that Eli Lilly\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) investment in GLP-1 drugs is crucial, as these medications are not easy to manufacture. He believes the company\u2019s spending in this area will help keep competitors from catching up. However, Cramer also acknowledged that, in the short term, the company has not done an ideal job in launching the drug, and he expressed his disappointment with that aspect of their performance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thrilled about that either. I gotta tell you, however, I can\u2019t think of a better chance to buy the stock on weakness given that Mounjaro has grown faster than any other large drug. So let me ask you, do we want the fastest ramp-up, or do we want the biggest drug of all time? The so-called community of analysts wants the former, I\u2019ll take the latter any day of the week. Oh, did I mention they\u2019ll soon have this weight loss drug in pill form, not just injectable for those who don\u2019t like to give themselves a shot once a week? Of course, it\u2019s not just the botched launch that\u2019s holding Lilly back. Bobby Kennedy, Jr. (Robert Kennedy Jr.), Trump\u2019s nominee for Health and Human Services is universally known as an anti-vaccine proponent. Now that\u2019s true, but you can also think of him as a believer in diet and exercise. He\u2019s not a huge fan of the GLP-1 drugs, but the food industry has made that diet and exercise regimen almost impossible for most people. So why not let those who can\u2019t diet or exercise enough, take the shot?\u201d\n\nCramer also pointed out a significant head-and-shoulders pattern in Eli Lilly\u2019s (NYSE:LLY) stock chart, which is often seen as a warning sign. He acknowledged that, in the short term, the outlook for the company may appear bleak. However, Cramer expressed his confidence in the company\u2019s long-term prospects, stating that he remains a firm believer in Eli Lilly\u2019s potential. His advice to investors? \u201cBuy, buy, buy\u201d the stock, indicating his optimism for the future despite the current challenges.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 1st on our list of the stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Shares of pharmaceutical stock Eli Lilly are cratering after the company lowered its sales guidance for Q4.\n\n2024 was an interesting year for pharmaceutical powerhouse Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%). At one point, share prices had gained as much as 65% on the year. However, after a less-than-spectacular earnings report published in late October, shares of Lilly started to slide considerably.\n\nAll told, Lilly stock still gained 33% in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Unfortunately, Lilly investors haven't had much to celebrate so far in 2025. On Jan. 14, shares of Lilly dropped by as much as 8% and ended the day down around 6%. Year-to-date, share prices are down about 1.4%.\n\nBelow, I'm going to dive into what caused Lilly's stock to drop earlier this week and assess if the current price action is a good opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nWhat caused Eli Lilly's stock to fall this week?\n\nDuring an earnings report, management will generally provide investors with a forecast for the next quarter and potentially the full year. This is a process known as financial guidance. Guidance is important because it ultimately serves as a way for investors to hold management accountable should the financial picture and operating results start to get off track.\n\nBack in October, Lilly reported earnings for the third quarter. During this report, management provided revenue guidance for the full year 2024 in the range of $45.4 billion to $46 billion. This was nominally below management's prior guidance range -- which signaled total sales of $46.6 billion at the high end.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Lilly surprised investors with another revision to its full-year guidance. Per the company's press release, Lilly now expects to generate $45 billion in sales for 2024 -- a decrease from the lower range of its prior forecast.\n\nNaturally, this was unwelcome news, and investors punished Lilly by selling off its stock.\n\nHow big of a deal is this guidance miss?\n\nI don't mean to overgeneralize, but companies miss guidance all of the time. Missing guidance in and of itself is not a reason to panic. What's more important is why a business is not performing at the level it thought it would. Once those details are uncovered, it becomes much easier to assess whether a company indeed has problems or if it's simply experiencing a temporary bump in the road.\n\nAs for Eli Lilly's situation at the moment, it's important to remember that the company is still on pace to grow annual revenue by 32%. As an investor in Lilly myself, I can't turn my back on a company growing at this pace.\n\nI think what really caused the recent sell-off was Lilly's specific guidance related to its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. For the fourth quarter, Lilly calls for revenue of $3.5 billion for Mounjaro and $1.9 billion for Zepbound.\n\nConsidering that these two treatments are Lilly's biggest tailwinds, it's easy to connect the dots between the company's lower sales estimate and the acceleration at which Mounjaro and Zepbound are moving.\n\nBut here's the subtle idea I think most investors are overlooking. Despite these lower-than-expected sales figures, Lilly is still expected to generate record revenue from both of its weight loss treatments in the fourth quarter, signaling that demand is still in a great spot overall.\n\nShould you buy the dip in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nAs of market close on Jan. 15, Lilly stock is hovering near its lowest level in about six months.\n\nConsidering that management is still calling for another year of 32% revenue growth in 2025, I'm hard-pressed to explain why investors are panic-selling the stock. To me, Lilly remains one of the most rock-solid investment opportunities in the pharmaceutical arena.\n\nBeyond weight loss, the company has a flourishing oncology business, and some medications approved to treat Alzheimer's Disease and eczema have yet to even reach scale. In my eyes, now is a fantastic opportunity to take advantage of Lilly's depressed price action and buy the stock hand over fist.",

            "content": "Nothing like going to one of the largest research conferences in the world and having everyone down in the dumps about their sector. That was the case from the moment I got to JPMorgan's annual health healthcare conference in San Francisco on Monday to the moment I wrapped up my West Coast tour Wednesday. It felt more like a wake than an industry pep talk \u2014 something that happens when the room is full of people whose stocks are sitting near their 52-week lows, while so many of the host city's tech companies are banging on the roof of yearly highs. That's what happens when you are the pharma skunk surrounded by the tech garden party. I want to give you a behind-the-scenes look at a conference that's become more of a dealmaking marathon than an actual dog-and-pony show. It's such an important conference that I put Lisa Gill, who leads JPMorgan's healthcare research team, on \"Mad Money\" to describe what she expected to hear. A preview. I don't like to put analysts on the show. It's a CEO-driven show, not an analyst show, because I believe you should have no filter between the companies and you. Why should there be? You need to make up your mind, I don't want someone paid to do it for you. The conference is gigantic. There are thousands of people there: analysts, hedge fund managers, CEOs, public relations people, bankers, lawyers \u2014 everyone you need to put together a deal, and that's exactly what happens. Every year. Gill boasted about it on the show, talking about how a huge percentage of deals start at the conference. Why not? Everyone's there. You see people from companies you are interested in. You sidle up. You talk about commonalities. Take it from there. When I first heard this a decade ago, I didn't believe it. But I have now been making this pilgrimage for multiple years and I can tell you it's the truth. Not only do deals start here, they end here. I have seen takeover after takeover come to fruition. Here are some of the impressions and observations from this year's trip gathering. Think of them as takeaways to inform your investing decisions in the days and months ahead. 1. A dark cloud hangs over the industry. In previous years there was a joy to the conference. This year, the large number of police you saw from the moment you got there was a reminder that a prominent UnitedHealth Group executive, Brian Thompson, was murdered in early December at the insurer's annual investors conference. Sadness met you at the door. There would be no prominent managed care presenters this year. Safer for all. I had a full slate of executives to interview from the get-go. CEOs from Medtronic , Boston Scientific , Cardinal Health , Merck , Biohaven , Abbott Labs , as well as several off-the-record sessions with other leaders of companies \u2014 some private, some public. CNBC had an extraordinary makeshift setup in a hotel cafeteria, but before the assassination we had a full-blown studio, meant to be prominent. No need to be prominent now. 2. There are lots of excuses for poor performance ... I know most of these CEOs by now and we enjoy each other's company. We all joked about how poorly the group's been doing. The list of the excuses is as a long as half my arm but let me spew some: An economy that just won't quit. An economy that, if it slowed, would be greeted with interest rate cuts, which would drive money into the cyclicals. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of Health and Human Services doesn't believe in the foundation of so much research: vaccines. A group of companies with nothing revelatory to offer. A leaving administration that was incredibly hostile to the group and was able to accomplish the unthinkable: passing legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate prices, via the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014 something that actually is deflationary. An incoming administration that seems equally hostile. A sense that Thompson's murder had a lot to do with a group that's not allowed to trumpet itself without calling needless attention to itself. 3. ... but plenty of positives, too. Once you got one-on-one with executives, there was a solid show-and-tell. Boston Scientific is crushing it and its competitors in atrial fibrillation (AFib). Medtronic is chronically undervalued, something that actually changed for the better as the week went on. Cardinal Health has value and isn't just a hated middleman (like Cencora and McKesson ). Merck's Keytruda cancer franchise is worth a lot more than you think. Bristol Meyer's schizophrenia drug Cobenfy is working and the scripts are stronger than you think. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Intra-Cellular for $14 billion for its central nervous system franchise meant to treat the same illnesses is not that effective (ouch!). Abbott Labs is going to win the big litigation involving its special infant formula which should add ten bucks to the stock. 4. That includes new innovative products. Once you get away from the stocks, you grow excited about what's happening. Lots of science, including potentially personalized medicine for hard-to-beat cancers. Lots of healthcare solutions, including Abbott Labs' consumer biowearable Lingo. The glucose monitoring system was a hit at CES earlier this month and gives you a readout of how your body's doing from a quarter-sized device. It's so much better than what you get from your Apple Watch that it should move the needle. 5. Even I got in on the dealmaking (sort of). We bought more shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb this week because of how amazing Cobenfy can be for what amounts to an epidemic of schizophrenia. The drug, which was approved late last year, can be so effective that I even told San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie that he ought to call Bristol CEO Chris Boerner and figure out a way to get the drug for many of the city's homeless, as they are rife with this horrendous illness. Hey, I did my own, perhaps sainted, dealmaking. 6. Weight loss drugs are the talk of the town ... The wonder drug that still has everyone talking is the GLP-1 franchise owned by Eli Lilly , its popular weight-loss treatment Zepbound and type-2 diabetes drug Mounjaro. (I didn't meet or see rival Novo Nordisk , which makes GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy). Lilly CEO David Ricks preannounced his quarter, which was weaker than expected, but gave an outlook which was stronger than expected. The dichotomy was stark as the stock got clobbered on the fourth-quarter shortfall but would, in a bull market, have been roaring 50 to 60 points. Yes it would have been that great. Another positive: The Biden administration on Friday unveiled the next 15 prescription drugs , including Ozempic, that will be subject to price negotiations between manufacturers and Medicare. That's a big deal considering there was talk that maybe Medicare wouldn't cover the weight loss drugs at all. 7. ... but are still a major source of debate. The real question revolved around the potential increase of U.S. adults using weight loss drugs to 12%, from the current estimate of 8%. Those users who want to stay vanity thin would have to pay out of pocket, but those with co-morbidities would be covered by any insurer. That's another reason why the trust keeps Eli Lilly, which now looks like a busted stock. The sheer number of trials for all sorts of things that haven't been talked about \u2014 joints, cancers, dementia, and alcoholism, among others \u2014 could drive that percentage even higher. Of course, there were plenty of people talking about how it could bankrupt \"the system,\" with others claiming it could have save millions. Everyone had an opinion even as I could sense that no one knew anything \u2014 especially because RFK Jr. is a believer in diet, exercise and the end of junk food as a way to lose weight, as if obesity is a choice and not an illness. 8. We are sticking with Eli Lilly. I came away with a definitive sense that Lilly stock is undervalued because of the trials going on for so many illnesses. But the stock cast a pall on the realities of the situation, again a bear market phenomenon. It would be so easy to kick this one out of the trust for a huge gain. But I am stubborn and want to buy back the substantial amount of shares that we sold. CEO Ricks is terrific. His confidence is palpable. He admits he screwed up the launch of the GLP-1s. Very few CEOs would ever cotton up. He knows that the sheer size of the demand and the convoluted way that they were distributed via the middlemen, chiefly Mckesson , was a problem. It didn't help that Hims & Hers and other outfits were allowed to make and profit from knock-off versions of the drugs when there was a shortage from Lilly (The FDA determined in December that there is no longer a shortage and those compounders have to wind down operations in the coming month or two). It's a total mess. I think everything will be figured out in 2025, so the estimates will prove low. Lilly is spending $20 billion to create manufacturing space. That's a huge competitive advantage. Don't forget the rest of the world. Lilly hasn't. The numbers could dwarf what people expect. 9. Cardinal and Abbott should be higher. I was struck by how Cardinal's generic drug-making business could be gigantic and is not priced into the stock, which trades more like a low-margin distributer than a manufacturer. Abbott is particularly aggrieved because the market is treating all litigation like it is equal and that means this fine company's stock is kept back by the dreaded Johnson & Johnson talc powder analogue, even as that will ultimately be resolved for less than what was expected by Wall Street. (The company's $8 billion proposed settlement would end tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc products caused cancer.) So many are worried about the loss of exclusivity for so many drugs, that the patent cliff is too great. I don't share that pessimism. 10. Opportunities abound. The execs are a cerebral group. They know that they are out of favor. They've been there many a time. They are prepared to handle it even as the biggest wild card, of course, is Trump himself. Is he pro-business for real? Is pharma a real business to him? Does he mean it when he says the middlemen take more than they should? It's certainly true from what I can tell and Rob Davis, the self-effacing Merck CEO, is willing to call them out on it. There's a lot of rancor there and it seems untenable if Congress was to examine the situation at the behest of the big drug companies. I know the rap on these execs. They are just salespeople. They don't develop anything. They have plenty of scientists. I see it up close because I am developing a drug with Biohaven that has yet to be announced. Scientists galore at that company. But they are the first to admit that they see so many opportunities at this conference \u2014 who can resist? In the end, isn't everything for sale?

            "content": "Having made waves the world over, revolutionary anti-obesity drugs Wegovy and Ozempic (manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk), and Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide are set to enter the Indian market this year. \u201cWe anticipate a positive response from the Indian market,\u201d Eli Lilly (India) told FE, as the company gets ready to bring its anti-obesity drug tirzepatide, or Mounjaro, to India this year. The company also said it will price its drug competitively for the Indian market.\n\nCompetitor Novo Nordisk had initially planned to bring its Wegovy to India in 2026, but reports say they will likely pre-pone their arrival to coincide with Eli Lilly, not wanting to miss out on the huge opportunity the Indian market brings. The company declined to comment when asked by FE on a possible launch date in India.\n\nThese drugs have made bank in the West so far, which is what makes their entry exciting here as well. In 2023, Novo Nordisk\u2019s share price increased by over four times from what it had been just five years ago \u2014 and it not only became Europe\u2019s most valuable company but also had a market capitalisation that was higher than its native country Denmark\u2019s GDP. In 2022, over 65% of all drug prescriptions in the US were for Ozempic alone.\n\nIn fact, in the second quarter of this financial year, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound made $1.24 billion and Mounjaro made $3.09 billion, far exceeding expectations.\n\nInterestingly, celebrities like Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey and Amy Schumer, among others, have also endorsed drugs like Ozempic after using them for weight loss. In India, too, the weight loss transition of celebrities like Karan Johar, Kusha Kapila, Tanmay Bhat, etc, have been linked to Ozempic, though they have denied taking these medicines.\n\n\u201cAs per the India Economic Survey 2024, obesity is a serious concern among India\u2019s adult population, with the adult obesity rate having more than tripled. It is critical that people with obesity are able to access comprehensive care that can prevent and treat the disease,\u201d the Eli Lilly spokesperson told FE.\n\nSensing the shake-up this will bring to the Indian pharma sector, domestic pharma companies are also in a race to come up with alternatives or prototype versions of these drugs that are more economical, more accessible, or have exclusivity benefits.\n\nSun Pharma is working on an anti-obesity drug utreglutide. Cipla is coming up with a generic and affordable version of Wegovy, and is eyeing a deal with Eli Lilly to market its drug in the country. Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories is also coming up with a generic version of Wegovy. Biocon, on the other hand, is working on GLP-1 therapies, and has got an approval for liraglutide. Similar to Cipla, Natco Pharma is also developing a generic version of Ozempic.\n\nThe interest in these drugs is justified. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) had stated that one in eight people in the world lived with obesity\u2014and that obesity was responsible for 44% of all diabetes cases, 23% of ischemic heart diseases, and 7-41% of all cancer cases. A 2024 Lancet study focused on India found that at least 44 million women and 26 million men who were over 20 years old, were clinically obese.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no specific data on how many people with obesity need surgical intervention or medication in India, Dr Anoop Misra, executive chairman and director, diabetes and endocrinology, Fortis C-Doc Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences, told FE that most patients with obesity are prescribed medication, adding, \u201cMore and more patients are coming with queries regarding anti-obesity medications now that they have become aware of it.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the problem is such that after all the acclaim that these drugs received, people were travelling to foreign countries to access them, resorting to grey markets, and even getting these imported from Europe, in a phenomenon dubbed \u2018Ozempic tourism\u2019.\n\nBecause of this huge scale, Eli Lilly said their \u201cpricing strategy in India will reflect the medicine\u2019s efficacy and the significant value it brings in reducing the overall health and economic burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity\u201d. The company\u2019s spokesperson added that however, \u201cwe have not yet finalised the pricing of tirzepatide\u201d.\n\nIn the US, without insurance, Wegovy can cost around $1,350, Ozempic can cost around $968, and Zepbound (or tirzepatide) can cost around $1,060 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nBut would insurance companies in India cover these medications? Pankaj Nawani, CEO of CarePal Secure, a medical insurance provider, said, \u201cTraditionally, health insurance policies in India exclude obesity treatments, considering them lifestyle-related rather than medically necessary. This stance may evolve as obesity gains recognition as a chronic condition linked to severe comorbidities, which already qualify for coverage.\u201d\n\nNawani goes on to add that insurance coverage will depend on other factors as well \u2014 regulatory clearance from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, doctors prescribing these drugs for managing obesity-related complications rather than for weight loss alone, competitive pricing, etc. \u201cA shift in public health narratives toward preventive care may encourage insurers to reconsider their stance, particularly if these drugs demonstrate cost savings by mitigating long-term healthcare expenditures,\u201d Nawani told FE.\n\nThe biggest benefit of these drugs would, of course, be to the patients. Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman and head of endocrinology and diabetes at Max Healthcare, Delhi, explained, \u201cThe existing anti-obesity drug choice in India is poor. Patients would take orlistat, sibutramine, etc, which weren\u2019t very effective or potent and had a lot of side effects. But the way these drugs work, especially the GLP-1 pathway, is exciting.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, a lot of people would qualify as candidates for these drugs too. Since Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are both essentially making anti-diabetic drugs that also have strong weight loss properties, the first candidates would be patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDr Mithal added that people with severe obesity and out of control weight problems that are causing comorbidities like sleep apnea and osteoarthritis, would be prescribed these drugs too. \u201cBut patients who have a medical history of pancreatitis and thyroid cancer in the family will not be prescribed any of these drugs,\u201d Dr Mithal went on to say.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent\u2019s confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \u201cliked it.\u201d He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there\u2019s the process respecters and the process undoers,\u201d Cramer thinks. He \u201cfelt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he\u2019s talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\u201d While during their exchange, Cramer thought \u201cSanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\u201d However, Bessent and Sanders actually \u201chad common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\u201d according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect\u2019s potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \u201cI agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I\u2019m not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it\u2019s kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I\u2019m trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn\u2019t jump out at me.\u201d\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \u201d We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we\u2019d say they\u2019re amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\u201d believes Cramer. China needs \u201cexports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don\u2019t wanna help anyone,\u201d according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \u201cPresident-elect Trump was elected,\u201d he shared. Cramer shared that this is \u201cbecause the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\u201d China\u2019s hostility leads Cramer to \u201cthink that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that\u2019s smart to try.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \u201cWell look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn\u2019t Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That\u2019s a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\u201d he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \u201cWell, I liked that even though everything we\u2019ve ever read all our lives says that they\u2019re inflationary.\u201d\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \u201cBessent\u2019s a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you\u2019re close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I\u2019ll bet Bessent. He\u2019s really exciting. He\u2019s an exciting intellect.\u201d In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \u201cmay know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\u201d\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\u201cHe was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone\u2019s hacking you, you\u2019re blocked, because they don\u2019t have the eye, like you know it\u2019s vision, or it\u2019s finger. And we don\u2019t do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it\u2019s very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don\u2019t. Which is crazy.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 56\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has been one of the top-performing stocks on Wall Street over the past couple of years because of its weight loss medications. The shares are up by 16.4% year-over-year. Cramer has spent quite a bit of time discussing Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in January. He continues to support the firm despite the fact that year-to-date the stock is down by 6.7% as investors worry about weak guidance. Cramer believes that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s narrative will be driven by its drug approvals. His latest comments surrounded Medicare coverage extending to weight loss drugs:\n\n\u201cI think that there are a lot of people who felt that this had to happen. Uh, David Ricks, would be one of them, the CEO of Lilly. I think that you don\u2019t have comorbidities with these and it\u2019s going to be difficult. Otherwise they would, you know you talk about eight billion dollars, maybe for Novo, and Lilly\u2019s drug is superior in terms of weight reduction at the same dose. No one thought that they would be able to just run amok. And I think that while the stocks are down, it\u2019s going to be the greatest drug of all time. And everybody knows that. The persistence level of people who take it is much higher than what we\u2019re hearing about. Drug and exercise, exercise has failed us. Diet has failed us. So drug is the way to make it so that people who can\u2019t lose weight have to take it. But it\u2019s not a shock. You go sell it, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nOverall LLY ranks 11th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the show by commenting on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. The CPI is an inflation measurement, and the data for December saw prices rise by 0.4% monthly and 2.9% yearly. The monthly figure was above economist expectations of 0.3% while the annual figure was in-line. Naturally, this would suggest positive market movement but the investor reaction was muted. Commenting on the reaction, Cramer shared: \u201cLook what can I say. People told me that, again and again, if it just came in in-line that would be bad. That turned out to be a great mis-judgement. An in-line number in an atmosphere where we felt that things are going to, that everything\u2019s going to go explode to the top and we\u2019re going to be seeing five percent on the ten-year and six percent on the thirty, all these crazy things. All of the table, at least for today.\u201d\n\nCramer added that market sentiment is at opposite ends when it comes to interest rates and earnings. This is because Investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to cut interest rates by much this year. According to him, \u201cWhen I look at this market. . . there was a tremendous amount of negativity about interest rates but positivity about earnings. If you take the negativity about interest rates off, you look at the earnings that we saw this morning, people are going to be pretty optimistic. And it might be sustainable throughout, I don\u2019t know, a little while. These are great numbers that we saw this morning.\u201d\n\nThe day had started with big banks releasing a set of earnings release that sent their stocks soaring. However, Cramer\u2019s co-host, David Faber, cautioned that when he previously appreciated positive bank earnings, the stocks ended up dipping in the aftermath. Cramer responded by agreeing with Faber\u2019s assessment and adding \u201cI think the difference might be that the tone of the comments at least from what I\u2019ve talked to the, from the CEOs, on the calls, will be a little more positive. For something that we, I think we all struggle to try to get a handle on which is this notion of animal spirits. [The] Notion of optimism.\u201d\n\nHe linked some of the optimism with the perception of the incoming administration being more friendly towards banks when it came to regulation. \u201cYou know, Carl, when you see CEOs, you try to figure out what\u2019s happening in the country since the election. And you hear people say listen it\u2019s a peaceful transition, you hear people say it\u2019s a much better environment for deals,\u201d Cramer commented. He added \u201cBut I come back and just say, what\u2019s really going on is a belief that it, when it comes to the banks, that there was some sort of tyrannical regime. . . If they are gone, then maybe there is a runway for more than just one quarter\u2019s growth.\u201d",

            "content": "GLP-1 drugs have become all the rage for weight loss, with sales for drugs like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Eli Lilly's (LLY -2.46%) Mounjaro skyrocketing over the past year. However, Eli Lilly recently surprised investors when it cut its full-year revenue guidance ahead of an investor conference after sales of its GLP-1 drugs fell short of expectations.\n\nEli Lilly now expects revenue to be approximately $13.5 billion for its fourth quarter and $45 billion for the full year 2024. The company had earlier forecast full-year revenue to come in between $45.4 billion to $46 billion. Analysts, meanwhile, were projecting Q4 revenue of $13.94 billion and full-year revenue of $45.49 billion, as compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe new forecast from Lilly reflects 44% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter and 32% for the year. So the company is still seeing strong growth -- just not as robust as anticipated. It is also worth noting that Lilly's original full-year revenue guidance was for $41 billion, so it handily surpassed that.\n\nGLP-1 drugs still lead the way for Eli Lilly\n\nTurning to its GLP-1 drugs, Lilly is looking for sales of Mounjaro to be $3.5 billion and $1.9 billion for Zepbound. Mounjaro is FDA-approved to help improve blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, but is commonly used off-label for weight loss. Zepbound has the same active ingredient, tirzepatide, but is approved for weight loss in obese adults or overweight adults with at least one weight-related condition, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure.\n\nA year ago, Mounjaro had sales of $2.2 billion, so that would be an increase of 59%. Zepbound had just been introduced and only had sales of $175.8 million a year ago.\n\nAt a JPMorgan conference following the announcement, the company said the revenue shortfall stemmed from weaker-than-expected scripts for diabetes in December. The company said December is usually a strong month, as people will often get two scripts to avoid deductible costs in January, but that this did not happen this year.\n\nLooking ahead, the company forecast 2025 revenue to come in between $58 billion to $61 billion, which would represent growth between 29% to 36%. It said it did not push its missed 2024 December sales into January, nor did it include a strong December in its 2025 guidance.\n\nLilly noted that it has spent aggressively to add more manufacturing capacity for its GLP-1 drugs, spending $23 billion over the last three years. It expects to be able to ship 60% more doses in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. The company said overall capacity growth for 2025 was uncertain, as there are regulatory and technical channels it needs to work through before seeing how much capacity it can add in the back half of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company discussed how its international opportunity in terms of volumes was about 9 times that of the U.S. market. However, it noted that international pricing comes in lower.\n\nOutside its incretin drugs, the company said it saw strong performances in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience medicines. It noted that sales of non-incretin drugs rose by 20% in the quarter. It is looking for several newer non-incretin drugs to also help drive revenue in 2025, as it has several new drugs to treat conditions like cancer, ulcerative colitis, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIs it time to buy the dip on Eli Lilly?\n\nIf Lilly is correct in its assessment that its revenue shortfall was due to a lack of patients doubling scripts in December, as is typical for some drugs, the company could see a stronger-than-expected Q1. Meanwhile, its overall 2025 forecast looks to be conservative, with the company not accounting for the potential of even more doses of its popular GLP-1 drugs being available in the second half.\n\nGLP-1 drugs are likely to remain popular, and the company has a big international opportunity ahead of it as well. Meanwhile, its non-weight loss drug portfolio is also growing nicely.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Lilly trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 25.4 times 2025 analyst estimates, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 0.3. PEGs below 1 are generally considered undervalued, so on that basis, the stock is very cheap.\n\nGiven its valuation and the growth still in front of it with GLP-1 drugs, investors can look to buy the dip in Eli Lilly stock.",

            "content": "The US market for weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1s, is set to expand on a massive worldwide scale.\n\nGiven the global burden and prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases, this poses a challenge for global health community.\n\nFive key takeaways from the US highlight the clinical and economic realities of GLP-1 expansion.\n\nWith obesity and related chronic diseases on the rise worldwide, GLP-1 receptor agonists (used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity) \u2013 namely Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound\u00ae and Mounjaro\u00ae, and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy\u00ae and Ozempic\u00ae \u2013 are being hailed as potentially transformative solutions.\n\nSince their 2020 surge in the US, these medications have demonstrated significant weight loss impact among Americans, and Wegovy\u00ae has specifically been found to reduce cardiovascular related deaths. Ongoing studies show the medications may also potentially prevent chronic kidney disease and protect against dementia.\n\nThe manufacturers are experiencing enormous demand for these medicines, and have faced challenges keeping up. As the manufacturers are still ramping up production to meet the growing demand, the lion\u2019s share of both the supply and commercialization efforts of GLP-1s have been pointed toward the US, despite the fact that the medications have gained approval in international markets.\n\nGiven these dynamics, the US presents a preview and case study of the GLP-1 tidal wave that\u2019s likely soon heading for international shores. The experiences gained and strategies adopted by the US healthcare community offer prescient insights that other nations can draw upon as they prepare to grapple with how GLP-1s fit into their healthcare ecosystems.\n\nHere are five vital takeaways from the US that the global health community should heed as it navigates the clinical and economic realities presented by GLP-1 expansion.\n\n1. Unprecedented demand of weight loss drugs breeds coverage pressures\n\nThe effectiveness of GLP-1s for weight loss is generating unparalleled public demand and, in turn, high prices from pharmaceutical companies. In the US, the fervour for access to these medications has placed immense pressure on political bodies and insurance companies to provide coverage.\n\nSix in 10 adults believe Medicare should cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss in overweight individuals, despite current legal prohibitions. This public sentiment in the US recently rose to a fever pitch, and the Biden Administration proposed a rule to enable Medicare and Medicaid coverage of the medicines. The jury is still out on if the Trump Administration will carry this forward.\n\nSimilarly, employers are feeling the demand from their employees. In one 2023 survey, employees ranked coverage for weight loss medications as more important than child care assistance, unlimited paid time off, and flexible work models.\n\nNationwide drug shortages are likely to continue to place pressure on regulatory bodies and pharmaceutical companies to ensure more equitable access as they address their supply chain issues.\n\nAs supply ramps and commercialization efforts grow internationally, the above scenarios are likely to repeat on a global scale. Policymakers and healthcare providers must brace for a surge in demand, and very loud voices asking for access to the medicines. Countries should ready themselves with transparent communication to manage expectations and put forward proactive strategies.\n\n2. Costs could spike quicker than anticipated\n\nIn the US, soaring demand for GLP-1s led to a rapid escalation in costs, with the market expanding from $26.61 billion in 2023 to an estimated $39.64 billion in 2024. This put significant strain on financial planning within employers and healthcare systems, leading many to scramble for effective cost management strategies, or even to drop coverage altogether.\n\nConsequently, affordability is also a major concern for patients, with out-of-pocket prices reaching $1,000 per month. Roughly half of patients who\u2019ve taken GLP-1s report difficulty affording them, regardless of insurance status.\n\nAs GLP-1 medications may require long-term therapy for chronic weight management, insurance companies and healthcare systems must grapple with the long-term financial implications of covering weight loss drugs for extended periods of time.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that GLP-1 prices are significantly less expensive across the globe, given the size of the prevalence of obesity, there is potential for economic challenges as demand grows, regardless of where the international prices stabilize. Robust economic forecasting, budget adjustments and utilization management tools will be necessary to help mitigate disruptions.\n\n3. The consumer marketplace will become more complex\n\nWhile shortages of GLP-1s in the US presented challenges for patients and health systems alike, it was a boon to consumer weight loss companies who rapidly adopted telemedicine prescription capabilities.\n\nIn addition, in the US, compounding pharmacies are to produce and sell lower-cost versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide to consumers. It\u2019s estimated that 30% of semaglutide in the US is sold by compounding pharmacies. Within this segment, the US has observed a variance in quality and standards.\n\nThis burgeoning marketplace necessitates foresight in regulation to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding public health. While some international regulators, like the EU, have taken actions to establish frameworks and standards for telemedicine providers and GLP-1 distributors, they can learn from the US experience on GLP-1 demand to further mitigate risks and ensure quality care.\n\n4. Rational coverage strategies are imperative\n\nThe prospect of offering blanket coverage for GLP-1 treatments to all individuals living with obesity is likely financially unsustainable, as the sheer volume of potential recipients can overwhelm healthcare budgets. In 2021, the US spent approximately 18% of its GDP on healthcare (nearly twice of the average OECD country) and is currently unable to provide comprehensive coverage.\n\nThe US is not alone in this \u2013 even Denmark\u2019s universal, tax-funded health system chooses not to subsidize Wegovy for its citizens, in part because the benefits of the drug did not support the high cost.\n\nKnowing this, other countries should explore targeted coverage strategies that prioritize high-risk populations or those most likely to benefit from GLP-1 therapies. Developing criteria for coverage eligibility and fostering partnerships with specialized GLP-1 care providers can help optimize resource allocation and maximize therapeutic outcomes that justify the cost.\n\n5. Lifestyle support alongside a weight loss drug is essential\n\nPerhaps most importantly, a GLP-1 alone is not enough to achieve optimal outcomes. Clinical trials that enabled US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval employed nutrition and exercise plans in concert with the medicine. In fact, FDA labels state that GLP-1s are to be used as an adjunct to diet and exercise.\n\nWhile these medications alone may appear like a clear path to sustained weight loss, there are challenges in long-term adherence to them, likely in part due to access and cost issues. One study showed that 50% of patients with obesity actually discontinued their GLP-1s after 12 months, and a potential outcome of this discontinuation is significant weight regain.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate post-GLP-1 weight regain, and optimize the drug\u2019s value for all parties, studies in the US market have shown that clinically rigorous GLP-1 care via evidence-based, scalable, and digital lifestyle programmes can enhance patient outcomes.\n\nResearch has also shown that managing obesity can be a complex journey, and taking GLP-1s is just one aspect of the patient experience. Between managing side effects, mitigating muscle loss and supporting struggles with adherence, patients may require ongoing, specialized care to reap the value of these medications.\n\nHealth systems that want to reduce wasted expenditures and cover these medicines responsibly can adopt digital lifestyle programmes that sit alongside GLP-1 prescriptions, and digital programmes are a way to do so in a scalable manner. Markets in the US have demanded this, and the number of digital GLP-1 companion programmes and products continues to grow at a significant rate,.\n\nPreparing for a healthier future\n\nAs the GLP-1 supply for obesity treatment becomes increasingly available, the US can serve as a valuable case study that sits a few years ahead of what other countries may soon grapple with. This offers both insights and cautionary tales that can inform global approaches to integrating these therapies.\n\nBy understanding and adapting to the lessons learned \u2013 through cost management, demand preparedness, marketplace regulation, strategic coverage, and enhanced care for GLP-1 patients\u2013 nations can help ensure the effective and equitable deployment of GLP-1s to their citizens.\n\nWhile a great deal of work lies ahead in adopting and leveraging GLP-1s, the global community can pave the way for a healthier future.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund\u2019s assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness\u2019 investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR\u2019s flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC\u2019s Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn\u2019t harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn\u2019t short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness\u2019 criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment\u2019s Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management\u2019s stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nAQR Capital Management\u2019s stake as of Q3: $591.7 million\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global leader in pharmaceuticals, offering treatments for diabetes, oncology, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, migraines, and more. Its flagship products include Humalog, Trulicity, Alimta, and Taltz. The company has also emerged as a leader in the growing obesity treatment market, with its GLP-1 class drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, driving prescription growth and solidifying its competitive edge.\n\nTo support its growth ambitions, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is investing heavily in manufacturing. It has committed an additional $1.8 billion to expand facilities in Limerick and Kinsale, Ireland, to meet rising demand for incretin therapeutics and produce Kisunla, its recently approved Alzheimer\u2019s treatment.\n\nOn December 20, Citi reiterated its Buy rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) with a $1,250 price target. This outlook followed Novo Nordisk\u2019s phase 3 REDEFINE-1 study results in the obesity market, which showed 22.7% weight loss at 68 weeks, below the anticipated 25% target. In comparison, Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide demonstrated 20.9% weight loss. Citi views Novo\u2019s lower-than-expected results as favorable for Eli Lilly, strengthening its competitive position, especially among patients with higher body mass indexes.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s Q3 2024 revenue surged 42%, driven by strong U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Non-incretin product revenue increased by 17%, with the gross margin reaching to 82.2%. Likewise, Eli Lilly\u2019s EPS rose significantly to $1.18, up from just $0.10 in Q3 2023. The company also returned $1.6 billion to shareholders while increasing R&D spending by 13%.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 7th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "The Shift in Eli Lilly\u2019s Revenue Forecast\n\nEli Lilly has made headlines recently due to its unexpected adjustment in revenue expectations. The pharmaceutical giant had previously forecasted annual revenues between $45.4 billion and $46 billion but now estimates total revenues to be around $45 billion for 2024. This change was prompted by fewer prescriptions for its popular GLP-1 diabetes medications, leading to investor concerns.\n\nDespite this news, Eli Lilly still anticipates a strong growth trajectory. Its fourth-quarter revenue is projected to grow by an impressive 44% compared to last year. Key products like Mounjaro and Zepbound, both involved in managing diabetes and obesity, are expected to bring in significant sales, with Mounjaro alone set for $3.5 billion.\n\nThe company is not slowing down in expanding production capabilities, having invested $23 billion over the past three years. As a result, Eli Lilly is poised to deliver 60% more doses by mid-2025, positioning itself for further growth, especially in international markets that are projected to be substantially larger than domestic opportunities.\n\nMoreover, Lilly\u2019s non-GLP-1 drug portfolio is thriving, experiencing a 20% sales increase this quarter. This diverse pipeline is expected to propel the company forward, making it an attractive option for investors who see the potential in both its GLP-1 drugs and expanding non-incretin medications. Now might be the ideal moment to consider Eli Lilly stock for those eyeing value in the biotechnology sector.\n\nImplications of Eli Lilly\u2019s Revenue Forecast Adjustment\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s revised revenue outlook not only reflects the company\u2019s immediate economic health but also resonates throughout the larger tapestry of the pharmaceutical landscape and its societal impact. The $45 billion revenue projection for 2024 indicates a potential ripple effect on healthcare innovation and access to effective treatments. As Lilly reels from reduced prescriptions of its diabetes medications, it raises questions about the sustainability of drug pricing and pharmaceutical marketing strategies, urging a reconsideration of how patient needs are prioritized.\n\nThe broader cultural implications of Lilly\u2019s situation cannot be understated. With the growing global diabetes epidemic \u2014 affecting 463 million people worldwide in 2019 \u2014 the demand for effective medications is paramount. The fluctuation in prescription rates may challenge not just Eli Lilly\u2019s market hold but also affect patient adherence to treatment regimens, crucial for managing chronic diseases. Thus, preventative health strategies and education must become amplified to support those at risk of diabetes.\n\nThe environmental impact of Eli Lilly\u2019s production expansion also warrants attention. An increase in manufacturing capabilities, while facilitating greater availability of medicines, could mean an uptick in resource consumption and waste. As the global economy pivots towards sustainability, it will be imperative for Eli Lilly\u2014and similarly situated companies\u2014to incorporate green practices into their operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the long-term significance lies in investor confidence and the potential of Lilly\u2019s expanding drug portfolio. Innovative products that address both diabetes and obesity may influence public health strategies and contribute to a much-needed shift in healthcare outcomes. As Eli Lilly navigates this transitional period, it will shape not only its corporate destiny but also the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s role in addressing global health crises.\n\nIs Eli Lilly the Next Big Thing for Investors? Here\u2019s What You Need to Know!\n\nThe Shift in Eli Lilly\u2019s Revenue Forecast\n\nEli Lilly, a prominent player in the pharmaceutical industry, has recently revised its revenue forecasts, generating significant attention among investors and market analysts. Initially predicting annual revenues between $45.4 billion and $46 billion, the company now anticipates total revenues of approximately $45 billion for 2024. This adjustment primarily stems from a decline in prescriptions for its highly popular GLP-1 diabetes medications, raising concerns among investors.\n\nOptimistic Growth Prospects\n\nDespite the lowered revenue expectations, Eli Lilly is poised for robust growth. The company projects a 44% increase in fourth-quarter revenue compared to the same period last year. With key products like Mounjaro and Zepbound, which focus on diabetes management and obesity, Eli Lilly is set to capture considerable market share. Notably, Mounjaro is anticipated to generate about $3.5 billion in sales alone.\n\nExpanding Production Capabilities\n\nEli Lilly is committed to scaling up its production capacity, having invested significantly\u2014$23 billion over the past three years. This strategic investment will result in the ability to deliver 60% more doses by mid-2025, enabling the company to tap into larger international markets, which are expected to present much greater opportunities than domestic sales.\n\nDiverse Drug Portfolio\n\nIn addition to its GLP-1 medications, Eli Lilly\u2019s non-GLP-1 drug range is also thriving, showcasing a 20% sales increase this quarter. This diversified pipeline enhances the company\u2019s market appeal, making it an attractive prospect for investors. The potential for growth in both GLP-1 and non-incretin medications positions Eli Lilly as a promising choice in the competitive biotechnology sector.\n\nComparative Insights: Eli Lilly vs. Competitors\n\n| Feature | Eli Lilly | Competitor A | Competitor B |\n\n|\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-|\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-|\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013|\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013|\n\n| 2024 Revenue Forecast | $45 billion | $40 billion | $42 billion |\n\n| Key Product Growth Rate | 44% in Q4 | 30% | 35% |\n\n| Investment in Production | $23 billion | $15 billion | $20 billion |\n\n| Dose Increase by 2025 | 60% more doses | 40% more doses | 50% more doses |\n\nExpert Predictions and Market Analysis\n\nIndustry experts suggest that now is an opportune moment for investors to consider Eli Lilly. As the company continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, it is likely to command significant interest in the biotechnology market. The sustained growth in its non-GLP-1 drugs, coupled with strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities, positions Eli Lilly favorably against competitors.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Eli Lilly navigates this revenue shift, its strategic focus on product expansion and market growth continues to excite investors.

The pharmaceutical giant has loads of potential just due to its fast-growing GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The former is a treatment for diabetes while the latter is its recently approved weight loss drug. They combined for just under $4.4 billion in sales during the company's most recent quarter (ended on Sept. 30, 2024).\n\nBut with these drugs in the early innings of their growth, there's a lot more room for Eli Lilly's sales and profits to rise a whole lot higher in the years ahead. And while investors may be concerned about the potentially crowded GLP-1 weight loss market in the future, Zepbound remains the best weight loss drug available. In clinical trials, tirzepatide (the active ingredient in both Mounjaro and Zepbound) helped people lose 26.6% of their body weight, on average, over an 84-week period.\n\nThe drug is a game changer for both the company as well as people who rely on it to lower their weight, as they become healthier in the process and reduce their risk for many obesity-related illnesses. Zepbound's huge success is largely why investors are bullish on the business, and why it looks unstoppable. And as the company works on oral drugs and other weight loss treatments, it could unlock even more growth opportunities down the road.\n\nEven though it's trading at 35 times next year's estimated future profits (based on analyst estimates), Eli Lilly can still be an excellent long-term buy given the potential it has. This is an unstoppable growth stock you can buy and hold in your portfolio for years.\n\nA bigger opportunity than ever\n\nKeith Speights (Intuitive Surgical): Once upon a time, the idea of using robots to perform surgeries would have only come up in science fiction. Thanks to Intuitive Surgical, robotic surgery is a reality today. Nearly 17 million procedures have been performed to date with its da Vinci robotic surgical system.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Intuitive Surgical has been one of the best medical device stocks around. Its shares have skyrocketed roughly 28,870% since the company's IPO in 2000. Over the last 12 months, the stock has jumped close to 60%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical projects worldwide procedure growth of between 13% and 16% this year. The upper end of the guidance range is a little lower than the 17% growth achieved in 2024. This reflects some near-term challenges for the company, including uncertainty in China and physician strikes in South Korea.\n\nHowever, the long-term opportunity for Intuitive Surgical is bigger than ever. A year ago, the company estimated that 7 million procedures are performed each year for which it already has products and clearances, with a total of around 21 million procedures it could target with products and clearances under development. Intuitive's new estimates increased both numbers by 1 million.\n\nAround 2.68 million procedures were performed with Intuitive's da Vinci system last year. Another 95,000 procedures were performed with the Ion robotic system used for peripheral lung biopsy. That's less than half of the market Intuitive could address with its current regulatory clearances and only 16.5% of the total addressable market.\n\nI expect Intuitive Surgical will capture much more of this market over the next few years. I also predict the addressable market will expand as populations age and the company's robotic technology improves.\n\nAn innovative powerhouse you can buy on the dip\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): In December, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' shares dropped off a cliff following poor phase 2 results for an investigational pain medicine. These things happen frequently in the volatile biotech industry, and in some cases, such as this one, it creates opportunities for investors to put their money in excellent stocks while they are down. Though Vertex Pharmaceuticals' investigational pain treatment might have flopped in a clinical trial, it could earn its first indication later this month.\n\nFurther, the drugmaker still has a monopoly in the market for therapies that treat the underlying causes of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease of the lungs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' dominance in that area continues to help it generate strong revenue and earnings. Elsewhere, Vertex's pipeline has made tremendous progress. The company earned approval for a newer, better CF medicine in December. It also won regulatory nods for Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy developed in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, starting in late 2023.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has a couple of late-stage programs and several others in the earlier stages of development. The company's track record of innovation speaks for itself. Many of its peers have tried and so far failed to develop competing CF therapies. While they may succeed eventually, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is now casting a wider net and developing medicines across several therapeutic areas. The company's lineup will look different in five years, but one thing won't change: Vertex Pharmaceuticals will continue to produce excellent returns for patient investors. That's why it's a no-brainer buy, especially at current levels.",

(Rex) Reklaitis, the Burton and Kathryn Gedge Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering and a member of the Young Institute, works on pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment in Purdue University\u2019s FLEX Lab. (Purdue University photo/Charles Jischke)\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. \u2014 Purdue University, in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company and Merck & Co. Inc., announced Friday (Jan. 17) the launch of the Young Institute Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Consortium, a collaborative effort to pioneer advances in making medicines.\n\nOperating within Purdue\u2019s William D. and Sherry L. Young Institute for Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals, consortium partners will revolutionize pharmaceutical manufacturing with a focus on sterile injectables and innovative aseptic manufacturing technology to ensure quality, safety and compliance.\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturing is a key component of Purdue\u2019s One Health initiative, which advances knowledge and innovation related to animal, human and environmental health and well-being through novel interdisciplinary research and industry partnerships.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the frontier of Pharma 4.0 \u2014 autonomous experimentation, advanced robotics, big data, smart factories, AI and machine learning,\u201d said Karen Plaut, Purdue\u2019s executive vice president for research. \u201cThrough this partnership, we will have a global impact in solving complex problems in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe consortium will elevate and enhance pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical advanced manufacturing by developing disruptive innovative technologies, autonomous systems, and smart AI and digital technology, together with industrially relevant education and training for the next generation of scientific leaders and researchers. The collaboration also underscores a commitment to onshoring pharmaceutical manufacturing while bolstering domestic production.\n\n\u201cAddressing pharma manufacturing challenges requires a significant advancement in technology. With an alliance of this caliber, the consortium will explore greater emphasis on both current and future advanced chemistries and accelerate research of innovative discoveries,\u201d said Elizabeth Topp, director of the Young Institute.\n\nTopp, who will serve as the new consortium\u2019s director, is a professor in the Department of Industrial and Molecular Pharmaceutics and the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering and is an expert in improving the shelf life and stability of pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe consortium will rely on the distinctive research strengths of Purdue, Lilly and Merck, leveraging the organizations\u2019 collaborative research relationship and workforce development programs.\n\nThe members anticipate the consortium will attract broad participation throughout the sector from other pharmaceutical companies, pharma contract manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, startups and venture capital firms, and will result in a broad base of stakeholders to chart the industry\u2019s future course.\n\nThe consortium will look to create systems equipped with automated visual inspection and in-line process and product quality monitoring, all of which will require a new generation of skilled pharmaceutical manufacturing engineers and scientists. Through research excellence and comprehensive training opportunities, this program is poised to continue strengthening the pharmaceutical sciences program and preparing talent to support the growth of the sector.\n\n\u201cBeing a founding member of the Young Institute means building on the remarkable legacy of next-generation manufacturing,\u201d said Arup Roy, senior vice president, technical services and manufacturing science at Lilly. \u201cTogether, we will transform the industry with advanced aseptic manufacturing technologies, innovative research, and top-notch education and training to bring pharmaceutical sciences into the future with sterile processing standards. Our work honors Bill Young\u2019s visionary spirit to shape the future of manufacturing and make it a core industry competency for a lasting impact on global communities.\u201d\n\nMerck Senior Vice President of Manufacturing Dave Maraldo said generative AI, machine learning and quantum computing are the future of the manufacturing process.\n\n\u201cIf our collaborative research efforts can use smart technology to accelerate the timeline from research to market, we can reduce costs and bring critical and effective therapies to patients with greater speed,\u201d Maraldo said. \u201cHarnessing innovation will help create a safe and sustainable future for the industry, and most importantly, allow us to better serve patients.\u201d\n\nIn addition to industry, the Young Institute Consortium will be supported by Purdue\u2019s colleges of Engineering, Pharmacy and Science, which will strengthen its ability to establish strategic priorities for training and education, to foster student engagement and to advance expertise in the field.\n\nThe Young Institute is one of Purdue\u2019s interdisciplinary Institutes and Centers at Discovery Park District, which bring together researchers across disciplines to advance large-scale research and drive innovations to solve the world\u2019s most critical problems. The Institutes and Centers at Discovery Park District are managed by Purdue\u2019s Office of Research.\n\nAbout Purdue University\n\nPurdue University is a public research institution demonstrating excellence at scale. Ranked among top 10 public universities and with two colleges in the top four in the United States, Purdue discovers and disseminates knowledge with a quality and at a scale second to none. More than 105,000 students study at Purdue across modalities and locations, including nearly 50,000 in person on the West Lafayette campus.

The company's latest trial for a higher-dose Wegovy showed it helps patients shed more weightbut not enough to dethrone Eli Lilly's (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound. Patients on the 7.2mg dose of Wegovy lost 20.7% of their body weight over 72 weeks, an improvement over the 17.5% seen with the standard 2.4mg dose. But here's the kickerZepbound has already clocked over 20% weight loss in trials, and a recent head-to-head showdown showed Lilly's drug delivering 47% more weight loss than Wegovy. Investors weren't thrilledNovo's U.S.-listed shares dropped more than 2% this morning, as worries about growing competition and looming Medicare price negotiations piled on.\n\nAnalysts aren't exactly throwing confetti. Sydbank's Soren Lontoft Hansen called the results fine but not super data. Meanwhile, Leerink Partners analysts doubled down on their confidence in Zepbound's long-term market share. Novo is already licking its wounds from another setbackits experimental two-drug combo, CagriSema, underwhelmed in trials, landing at 22.7% weight loss, barely moving the needle against Zepbound. With Wegovy now playing catch-up and CagriSema failing to shake up the game, Novo is staring down a serious challenge from Lilly, which is running away with the weight-loss drug crown.\n\nSo, what's next? Novo is hoping its upcoming trial for the higher-dose Wegovy in Type 2 diabetics can shake things up. But at this point, Eli Lilly is stacking wins, and Novo is running out of room to surprise. Investors will be watching the next data drop closelybecause in the high-stakes obesity drug market, second place doesn't cut it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) began a roll in late 2020 that lasted almost four years. During that time, it became the world's largest healthcare company, with a market cap that topped $860 billion at one point.\n\nHowever, note the caveats used to describe Lilly's big run: \"almost\" and \"at one point.\" Over the last eight weeks, the big pharma stock has pulled back significantly. This decline includes a sell-off earlier this week after Lilly cut its 2024 revenue guidance due to lower-than-expected demand for its obesity and diabetes drugs.\n\nThe drugmaker might soon get some help, though, from a perhaps surprising source. Could Donald Trump make Eli Lilly stock a no-brainer buy in 2025?\n\nTrump's tariffs\n\nOne of Trump's primary pledges during the presidential campaign was to impose steep tariffs on products imported to the U.S. The first Trump administration also put higher tariffs in place on some Chinese imports, but those efforts were small compared to what the president-elect wants to do in his second term.\n\nTrump referred to himself as \"Tariff Man\" during the campaign. He wants tariffs of at least 10% and up to 20% on all imports. Earlier this week, Trump posted on Truth Social that he planned to create an \"External Revenue Service\" to collect tariffs. This responsibility is currently handled by an existing federal agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe president-elect has singled out some countries for even higher tariffs. For example, he proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, the two biggest trading partners of the U.S. Trump floated a 60% tariff on products imported from China. He has also promised to impose \"very high\" tariffs on Denmark if it doesn't sell Greenland to the U.S.\n\nTariffs cause the prices of imported products to rise. The higher the tariff, the higher the price increase. Product manufacturers in other countries or importers in the U.S. sometimes might absorb some of the higher costs. However, that's the exception rather than the rule. Usually, the higher prices due to tariffs are passed along to consumers.\n\nSomething golden in Denmark\n\nWhat do Trump's tariffs have to do with Eli Lilly? Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.47%) is based in Denmark, which is one of the countries on Trump's list for especially high tariffs.\n\nNovo Nordisk's type 2 diabetes drug, Ozempic, is the main competition for Lilly's Mounjaro. Novo's obesity drug, Wegovy, is the top rival to Lilly's Zepbound. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, is primarily manufactured in Denmark, although Novo Nordisk has some manufacturing capacity in Clayton, North Carolina. It's likely, therefore, that steep tariffs on products imported to the U.S. from Denmark would cause the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to rise.\n\nTrump's threat seemed to rattle Novo's management somewhat. The company released a statement to media organizations that said, \"We will follow the situation closely. The geopolitical landscape in today's world is very dynamic, and we remain focused on our commitment to deliver lifesaving medicines to the patients we serve.\" However, the company wouldn't comment on any hypothetical impact on the prices of its drugs if the U.S. imposed tariffs on products imported from Denmark.\n\nAny price increase for Ozempic and Wegovy could help Lilly. The company would likely see the demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound increase, especially if insurers begin directing their members to Lilly's products to lower their costs.\n\nIs Lilly a no-brainer stock to buy in 2025?\n\nSo, will Trump make Lilly a no-brainer stock to buy this year? If we consulted a Magic 8 Ball, the answer would probably be, \"Ask again later.\"\n\nNo tariffs have been implemented yet. We don't know if Trump will carry out his threat related to Denmark. It's uncertain if his policies will lead to a broader trade war that hurts both Novo Nordisk and Lilly.\n\nHowever, while there are many unknowns right now, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Lilly. Sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound should continue to grow. Lilly could launch another obesity drug, weight-loss pill orforglipron, in early 2026. Its new Alzheimer's disease drug, Kisunla, should gain momentum.\n\nTrump's tariffs may or may not make Lilly a no-brainer stock in 2025. Still, I think it's a great stock to buy no matter what happens politically.",

For example, he proposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, the two biggest trading partners of the U.S. Trump floated a 60% tariff on products imported from China. He has also promised to impose \"very high\" tariffs on Denmark if it doesn't sell Greenland to the U.S.\n\nTariffs cause the prices of imported products to rise. The higher the tariff, the higher the price increase. Product manufacturers in other countries or importers in the U.S. sometimes might absorb some of the higher costs. However, that's the exception rather than the rule. Usually, the higher prices due to tariffs are passed along to consumers.\n\nSomething golden in Denmark\n\nWhat do Trump's tariffs have to do with Eli Lilly? Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) is based in Denmark, which is one of the countries on Trump's list for especially high tariffs.\n\nNovo Nordisk's type 2 diabetes drug, Ozempic, is the main competition for Lilly's Mounjaro. Novo's obesity drug, Wegovy, is the top rival to Lilly's Zepbound. Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, is primarily manufactured in Denmark, although Novo Nordisk has some manufacturing capacity in Clayton, North Carolina. It's likely, therefore, that steep tariffs on products imported to the U.S. from Denmark would cause the prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to rise.\n\nTrump's threat seemed to rattle Novo's management somewhat. The company released a statement to media organizations that said, \"We will follow the situation closely. The geopolitical landscape in today's world is very dynamic, and we remain focused on our commitment to deliver lifesaving medicines to the patients we serve.\" However, the company wouldn't comment on any hypothetical impact on the prices of its drugs if the U.S. imposed tariffs on products imported from Denmark.\n\nAny price increase for Ozempic and Wegovy could help Lilly. The company would likely see the demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound increase, especially if insurers begin directing their members to Lilly's products to lower their costs.\n\nIs Lilly a no-brainer stock to buy in 2025?\n\nSo, will Trump make Lilly a no-brainer stock to buy this year? If we consulted a Magic 8 Ball, the answer would probably be, \"Ask again later.\"\n\nNo tariffs have been implemented yet. We don't know if Trump will carry out his threat related to Denmark. It's uncertain if his policies will lead to a broader trade war that hurts both Novo Nordisk and Lilly.\n\nHowever, while there are many unknowns right now, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Lilly. Sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound should continue to grow. Lilly could launch another obesity drug, weight-loss pill orforglipron, in early 2026. Its new Alzheimer's disease drug, Kisunla, should gain momentum.\n\nTrump's tariffs may or may not make Lilly a no-brainer stock in 2025. Still, I think it's a great stock to buy no matter what happens politically.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "The company anticipates 2025 revenue growth fueled by Mounjaro and Zepbound, the first FDA-approved medication for adults with moderate-to-severe OSA and obesity, alongside new medicines and expanded manufacturing capacity.\n\nSummary: Eli Lilly announced its 2024 revenue expectations of $45 billion, reflecting a 32% year-over-year growth, driven by strong sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound, the first FDA-approved medication for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity. The company also provided 2025 revenue guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, fueled by incretin therapies, new product launches, and expanded manufacturing capacity. Despite falling slightly short of previous 2024 projections, Lilly remains optimistic about continued growth, citing progress in production and robust performance across its therapeutic portfolio.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nStrong Sales of Zepbound and Mounjaro: Zepbound, the first FDA-approved treatment for OSA and obesity, alongside Mounjaro, contributed significantly to Lilly\u2019s 2024 Q4 revenue of $13.5 billion. Optimistic 2025 Revenue Guidance: Lilly projects 2025 revenue between $58 billion and $61 billion, driven by incretin therapies, new medicines, and expanded manufacturing capacity expected to increase supply by 60%. Growth Across Therapeutic Areas: In addition to incretin therapies, Lilly reported strong performance in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience, with non-incretin revenues growing by 20% year-over-year in Q4 2024.\n\nEli Lilly and Company announced that it expects 2024 full-year worldwide revenue to be approximately $45 billion, which represents growth of 32% compared to the previous year, highlighting strong performance from Zepbound, the first FDA-approved medication for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity, alongside robust sales of Mounjaro.\n\nThe company also shared 2025 revenue guidance, anticipating sales will be between $58 billion and $61 billion.\n\nFor Q4 2024, Lilly now expects worldwide revenue to be approximately $13.5 billion, representing growth of 45% compared to Q4 2023. This includes approximately $3.5 billion for Mounjaro and $1.9 billion for Zepbound. In addition to the uptake of Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly saw strong performance from its oncology, immunology, and neuroscience medicines in Q4 of 2024.\n\nIn total, non-incretin revenue grew by 20% compared to Q4 2023. However, the company\u2019s expected 2024 revenue is $400 million, or about 3%, below the guidance range issued on Oct 30, 2024, as part of the Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\n\u201cWhile the US incretin market grew 45% compared to the same quarter last year, our previous guidance had anticipated even faster acceleration of growth for the quarter. That, in addition to lower-than-expected channel inventory at year-end, contributed to our Q4 results. We continued to make progress on our manufacturing build-out, and US supply across all doses of tirzepatide was available throughout Q4,\u201d says David A. Ricks, Lilly chair and CEO, in a release. \u201cThe rest of our medicines performed within our expectations.\u201d\n\nNew Indications Build Momentum\n\nLilly anticipates revenue growth contributions in 2025 from new Lilly medicines such as Jaypirca, Ebglyss, Omvoh, and Kisunla; approvals of new indications for existing Lilly medicines; launches of Mounjaro in additional worldwide markets, as well as potential launches of new medicines such as imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer. Incretin market and channel dynamics have been factored into the 2025 revenue guidance range.\n\n\u201c2024 was a pivotal and highly successful year for Lilly, and we expect to continue our momentum in 2025 with strong financial and operational performance,\u201d continues Ricks in a release. \u201cSales of Mounjaro and Zepbound posted robust sales growth in Q4, and we expect a continuation of that trend into 2025. We\u2019ll also bring additional manufacturing capacity online and expect to produce at least 60% more salable doses of incretins in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2024.\u201d\n\nThe company currently plans to share its full Q4 2024 financial results, including with respect to other metrics included in its financial guidance, and 2025 financial guidance on Feb 6, 2025.\n\nID 201950381 \u00a9 Michael Vi | Dreamstime.com\n\nFurther Reading for You:",

            "content": "The FDA on Wednesday signed off on the use of Eli Lilly\u2019s antibody Omvoh (mirikizumab) for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nThe decision \u201cmarks another step of progress in Lilly\u2019s plan for revenue diversification and expansion into inflammation,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in an investor note on Wednesday evening. Still, Omvoh\u2019s prospects in Crohn\u2019s disease remain modest, according to the analysts, especially since it \u201cfailed to reach superiority vs. Stelara.\u201d\n\nIn the Phase III VIVID-1 trial, results from which were posted in October 2024, more patients treated with Omvoh reached histologic response after 52 weeks versus Stelara\u2014though Lilly at the time conceded that this effect was only \u201cnominally statistically significant.\u201d\n\nData from VIVID-1 were used to support Wednesday\u2019s approval, demonstrating a 53% clinical remission rate and a 46% endoscopic response rate at 1 year. In both metrics, Omvoh\u2019s benefit was significantly superior to placebo, with p-values less than 0.001.\n\nStelara has long been known as a difficult \u201churdle\u201d to clear in the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) space, according to the BMO analysts, who pointed out that AbbVie\u2019s own Skyrizi and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Tremfya were each also unable to surpass the blockbuster\u2019s efficacy. Given this particular market dynamic, BMO expects Omvoh\u2019s uptake in Crohn\u2019s disease to be \u201cchallenging.\u201d The firm projects peak worldwide revenue of $801 million across IBD indications by 2032.\n\nStill, the BMO note stated that while Wednesday\u2019s label expansion might only be an \u201cincremental upside\u201d to Lilly\u2019s shares, it points to the pharma\u2019s \u201cprogress \u2026 in expanding its footprint in [inflammation & immunology],\u201d an important move for the company as it seeks to diversify its portfolio beyond obesity.\n\nMost prominently, however, is the pharma\u2019s $3.2 billion play to snap up Massachusetts-based Morphic Holding in July 2024. The merger, which closed a month later, will give Lilly MORF-057, a small-molecule drug candidate that blocks the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin. This mechanism targets the movement of lymphocytes from the blood into the intestines, addressing an underlying IBD pathway. MORF-057 is in mid-stage development for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nA few months later, in September 2024, Lilly\u2019s immunology portfolio snagged another win with the FDA\u2019s approval of its anti-IL-13 antibody Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 12 years and above.\n\nBeyond immunology, Lilly earlier this week announced a potential $2.5 billion deal with Scorpion Therapeutics\u2019 STX-478, a small molecule PI3K\u03b1 blocker for cancer.",

Overall, IBD affects about 2.4 million Americans, according to a recent study, with Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis being the most common.\n\nThe approval is based on a study that found Omvoh could help patients whose disease wasn\u2019t adequately controlled by previous treatments. However, two of the three largest pharmacy benefit managers have listed it as a first-line therapy, not requiring patients to have failed on another drug first, Lilly said Wednesday.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOmvoh is part of a slate of new medicines designed to build on Lilly\u2019s success with diabetes and obesity treatments that have boosted earnings and sent its shares soaring. The company won approval in colitis in October 2023, after an initial rejection in April 2023 based on manufacturing issues.\n\nDrugmakers have been pouring money into the gastrointestinal field in recent years and expanding the use of blockbusters such as AbbVie\u2019s Skyrizi to include colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Like Skyrizi, Omvoh is designed to target a specific subunit of the IL-23 protein to prevent inflammation. J&J\u2019s Tremfaya also blocks IL-23 while binding to the CD64 receptor on cells that produce IL-23 as well.\n\nWhile Omvoh\u2019s sales have been relatively modest to date, with revenue of $41 million in the third quarter, Lilly touted its potential for growth in guidance released Tuesday. Overall, the company said 2024 revenue increased less than it previously estimated; Lilly is due to report full results on Feb. 6.\n\nIn its approval announcement Wednesday, Lilly said Omvoh is the first biologic in more than 15 years to enter the market after sharing two years\u2019 worth of Phase 3 efficacy data in Crohn\u2019s disease. Almost 90% of patients who achieved clinical remission and endoscopic response in the first year of treatment with Omvoh maintained that status through an additional year in an ongoing open-label extension study, Lilly said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to clarify the percent of patients who continued to benefit through an additional year of follow-up.",

Jim Cramer, back from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said Thursday that Bristol Myers Squibb might be the best Club stock for 2025. He's extremely bullish about what he learned about the company's schizophrenia drug Cobenfy and its possible other uses to treat bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease-related psychosis. Jim called Bristol Myers stock \"dramatically undervalued,\" and said he would \"buy that aggressively.\" The Club's most recent Bristol Myers purchase was one month ago, just above the current price of $56 per share. Club name DuPont moved up its timeline for spinning off its electronics business, targeting Nov. 1. However, the planned separation into three companies was trimmed to two because DuPont is keeping its water business. Acknowledging the \"spin purgatory\" that has gripped DuPont stock, Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, said he hopes the expected break-up of Honeywell won't suffer the same fate. Jim agreed, saying that unlike DuPont, he would look to be a \"seller of Honeywell.\" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported fourth-quarter results that topped estimates, thanks to strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. The third-party maker of chips guided AI revenue to double this year, and that's good for Club semiconductor stocks Nvidia and Broadcom . Separately, Jim said he met with Nvidia founder Jensen Huang while in San Francisco and felt the CEO was blindsided by the Biden administration's new chip export controls . Jim and Jeff finished the Morning Meeting with a rapid-fire review of the Club's three financial firms that reported strong earnings Wednesday: Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and BlackRock .

Its medicines are sold in at least 125 countries including its 8 blockbuster drugs. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and S&P 100 indices, it brought in roughly $5.5 billion in revenue for 2021 and employs more than 35,000 people across its network of research and production facilities.\n\nEli Lilly and Company was founded in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. The colonel, a veteran of the Civil War, had recently dissolved an unsatisfactory partnership and set on his own to produce and develop medicinal chemicals. Colonel Lilly remained as president until his death in 1898. His charge to his family, company and coworkers was to \u201ctake what you find here and make it better and better\u201d. The company is well-known for many drugs, including the first mass-marketing of quinine to treat malaria.\n\nThe company brought in $4,470 in its first year and saw that figure grow 10X over the next 3. Among the many innovations during this time period is the addition of gelation coatings for pills which helped set the company up for rapid expansion. The company was incorporated in 1881 as Eli Lilly and Company issuing stock to family and friends. The 1900s brought about more change for the company, change in the form of expansion which included international markets.\n\nAdvancements during the war years included increases in efficiency due to increased automation and the development of precision technologies. Among the technologies was pill manufacturing which included injecting medicines directly into a gelation capsule. This method allowed for more exact dosing, setting the standard for modern production. The company produced capsules for itself and sold excess capacity to competitors. Other major advancements include fruit flavorings in medicine, straight-line manufacturing and a method of blueprinting manufacturing tickets to prevent errors.\n\nThe modern period saw the company grow and discover new, world-class pharmaceuticals. Today, the company is engaged in the discovery, development and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. It offers a wide range of treatments, including Prozac but is perhaps most noteworthy for its work with insulin. The company is the first to mass produce insulin and has made numerous advances in treating diabetes in the time since. While other drugs are more widely known, its diabetic drugs Basaglar, Jardience, Trulicity, Humalog and Humulin are its top-sellers and contribute the bulk of revenue and cash flow.\n\nAlong with Diabetic research, the company also focuses on Alzheimer's, Oncology, Immunology, Obesity and Pain care. At the end of 2022, the company pipeline had 23 compounds in Phase 3 clinical trials and 1 in review. There were another 18 in Phase 2 trials and more than 2 dozen in Phase 1 trials. The average cost to discover a new drug was running at $2.6 billion with a 10-year discovery-to-patient timeline.",

Omvoh is now approved in the U.S. for two types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), following its October 2023 approval as a first-in-class treatment for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults.1\n\nOmvoh works to reduce inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract by targeting a specific protein, interleukin-23p19 (IL-23p19), which is a key contributor to intestinal inflammation. Omvoh is the first biologic treatment in more than 15 years to have disclosed two-year Phase 3 efficacy data in Crohn's disease at the time of approval.2\n\n\"The burden of Crohn's disease on patients' daily lives is substantial,\" said Michael Osso , president and chief executive officer, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation . \"This approval is meaningful for adult patients with Crohn's disease, who now have more treatment options available.\"\n\nThis approval is based on positive results from the Phase 3 VIVID-1 study of Omvoh in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate) and/or biologics (TNF blockers, integrin receptor antagonists).1 VIVID-1 was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of Omvoh. Patients randomized to placebo who did not achieve clinical response by patient-reported outcome at 12 weeks (40% of placebo patients) were subsequently switched to Omvoh treatment. Both primary endpoints in VIVID-1 were achieved:\n\nClinical remission by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at one year 53% of patients treated with Omvoh achieved clinical remission at one year versus 36% on placebo* (p<0.001).\n\nEndoscopic response at one year 46% of patients treated with Omvoh had visible healing of the intestinal lining at one year versus 23% on placebo* (p<0.001).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, 32% of Omvoh patients achieved early improvement in endoscopic response, defined by visible healing of the intestinal lining, versus 11% on placebo at three months (p<0.001).\n\n*Placebo included patients switched to treatment with Omvoh at 12 weeks.\n\nOmvoh is also being studied in VIVID-2, an ongoing, open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating the e\ufb03cacy and safety of Omvoh for up to three years in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Among patients who achieved endoscopic response at one year in VIVID-1, over 80% maintained endoscopic response with one year of additional treatment (two years of continuous treatment). Additionally, among patients who achieved clinical remission and endoscopic response at one year in VIVID-1, nearly 90% of patients maintained clinical remission with one year of additional treatment (two years of continuous treatment).3\n\nIn both VIVID-1 and VIVID-2, Omvoh's overall safety profile in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease was generally consistent with its known safety profile in patients with UC. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of subjects and at a higher frequency than placebo during induction and through Week 52 of VIVID-1) associated with Omvoh treatment were upper respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions, headache, arthralgia and elevated liver tests. The labeling for Omvoh contains warnings and precautions related to hypersensitivity reactions, risk of infection, tuberculosis, hepatotoxicity and immunizations. See the Safety Summary below and full Prescribing Information.1\n\n\"Many patients with Crohn's disease have tried available therapies and are still seeking a treatment option that can work well for them to help control their disease,\" said Marla Dubinsky , M.D., chief, division of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition, co-director, Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Clinical Center, Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital , Icahn School of Medicine , Mount Sinai New York . \"The FDA approval of Omvoh may help adults with Crohn's disease achieve long-term remission and visible healing of the intestinal lining, even if they have tried other medications that did not work or stopped working.\"\n\nLilly has also submitted marketing applications for Omvoh in Crohn's disease around the globe, including in the European Union and Japan . Additional global regulatory submissions are planned. In UC, Omvoh is currently approved in 44 countries.\n\n\"People living with Crohn's disease have shared with us how truly disruptive symptoms such as abdominal pain, frequent bowel movements and bowel urgency can be,\" said Daniel M. Skovronsky , M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific officer, and president of Lilly Research Laboratories and Lilly Immunology. \"With Omvoh approved in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, more patients now have a treatment option that may provide long-term disease control and address key symptoms that matter most to them, reflecting Lilly's ongoing commitment to elevate care and improve outcomes for patients.\"\n\nLilly is committed to serving patients living with Crohn's disease and is working with insurers, health systems and providers to enable access to Omvoh. Effective Jan. 1 , Omvoh has successfully gained first-line biologic coverage** from two of the three largest pharmacy benefit managers. Through Lilly Support Services\u2122, Lilly offers a patient support program including co-pay assistance for eligible, commercially insured patients.\n\n**First-line biologic coverage means Omvoh is available on formulary in the preferred specialty tier, alongside other products, and does not require failure of other biologic agents prior to use.\n\nView the Omvoh brand logo.\n\nAbout the VIVID Clinical Trial Program\n\nVIVID-1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-week study. Patients received mirikizumab 900mg by intravenous (IV) infusion at Week 0, Week 4 and Week 8 followed by a maintenance dose of 300mg by subcutaneous injection (SC) at Week 12 and then every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 40 weeks. Patients randomized to placebo who did not achieve clinical response by patient-reported outcome at 12 weeks (40% of placebo patients) were subsequently switched to Omvoh treatment. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI <150. Endoscopic response was defined as >50% reduction from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) total score, based on central reading. Bowel urgency was also assessed with an Urgency Numeric Rating Scale (UNRS) of 0 to 10.\n\nParticipants who completed Week 52 of VIVID-1 and, in the investigator's opinion, would derive clinical bene\ufb01t from treatment with mirikizumab, were enrolled in VIVID-2. In VIVID-2, the primary objective is to evaluate the long-term e\ufb00ect of mirikizumab in clinical remission by CDAI and endoscopic response at Week 52 of treatment in VIVID-2 (totaling 104 weeks of continuous treatment). Safety is being assessed from the \ufb01rst dose in VIVID-2. Open-label extension studies may have selection bias as patients who cannot tolerate treatment or do not respond may drop out of the study prior to the extension.\n\nAbout Omvoh\u00ae\n\nOmvoh\u00ae (mirikizumab-mkrz) is an interleukin-23p19 antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in adults. Omvoh selectively targets the p19 subunit of IL-23 and inhibits the IL-23 pathway. Inflammation due to over-activation of the IL-23 pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nOmvoh\u00ae and its delivery device base are trademarks owned by Eli Lilly and Company .\n\nINDICATION AND SAFETY SUMMARY\n\nOmvoh\u00ae (ahm-VOH) is a medicine used to treat\n\nadults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis\n\nadults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease\n\nIt is not known if Omvoh is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.\n\nWarnings \u2013 Omvoh can cause serious side effects including:\n\nSerious allergic reactions: Omvoh may cause serious allergic reactions that may need to be treated in a hospital and may be life-threatening. Do not use Omvoh if you have had a serious allergic reaction to mirikizumab-mrkz or any of the ingredients in Omvoh. See the Medication Guide that comes with Omvoh for a list of ingredients. Stop using Omvoh and get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:\n\nfainting, dizziness, feeling lightheaded\n\nswelling of your face, eyelids, lips, mouth, tongue, throat, or trouble swallowing\n\ntrouble breathing, throat tightening, or wheezing\n\nchest tightness\n\nfast heartbeat or pounding in your chest\n\nsevere itching, hives, or redness all over your body\n\nsweating\n\nInfections: Omvoh may lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections and may increase your risk of infections. If you have an infection, your healthcare provider should not start treatment with Omvoh until your infection is gone.

But some experts weren\u2019t convinced, noting that Lilly was only offering the lowest doses in vials, and the new prices, $399 or $549 a month, are still prohibitive for many patients.\n\nCEO Dave Ricks said Lilly is now considering expanding the vial offering. \u201cWe\u2019d like to lower the entry cost and we\u2019d like to have more doses available. That\u2019s not something we\u2019re announcing today, but we see that as an option,\u201d he said Tuesday at a taping of \u201dThe Readout LOUD,\u201d STAT\u2019s biotech podcast.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLilly has been offering the vials only to patients paying on their own without insurance, also known as self-pay.

            "content": "Lilly plans to share its full Q4 2024 results on 6 February 2025. Credit: JHVEPhoto via Getty Images.\n\nEli Lilly has announced a $400m reduction in its 2024 revenue forecast, marking a 3% shortfall from its October 2024 guidance.\n\nThe revised outlook, discussed at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference 2025 on 14 January, has been attributed to stocking levels and unexpected market dynamics in Q4 2024 in the diabetes glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) market.\n\nFor Q4 2024, Lilly now expects global revenue of approximately $13.5bn, a 45% increase from Q4 2023. This growth is driven by the strong performance of its incretin-based drugs, including diabetes treatment Mounjaro (tirzepatide), which made $3.5bn in sales, and obesity drug Zepbound (tirzepatide), which made $1.9bn. Additionally, the company reported a 20% increase in revenue from non-incretin products across oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Despite these gains, the overall revenue forecast fell short of initial projections.\n\nShares in the company dipped by 7% following the 14 January announcement before recovering slightly to close 5% lower than the market open.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s CEO Dave Ricks acknowledged the challenges in predicting growth in the rapidly expanding GLP-1RA market.\n\nDuring the conference presentation, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s always disappointing to miss your own expectations. We\u2019re dealing with a business that is unprecedented in our sector in terms of size, scale, and growth rate.\u201d\n\nThe company faced significant disruptions last year due to shortages of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, as demand outpaced supply. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared the shortages over in December 2024, following substantial manufacturing investments by Lilly. These shortages drove some patients to seek alternatives from compounding pharmacies, impacting sales momentum.\n\nLilly has asked to join an opposing lawsuit brought by compounding pharmacies against the FDA over the agency\u2019s decision that the company\u2019s blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs are no longer in short supply. Lilly stated that it could not rely on the FDA to fully defend its interests.\n\nThe court case will determine whether compounding pharmacies and facilities can keep selling cheaper versions of the company\u2019s tirzepatide-based drugs, as they have been allowed to do during the shortages.\n\nTo meet the surging demand, Lilly plans to \u201cproduce at least 60% more saleable doses of incretins in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2024\u2033, said Ricks. The company\u2019s investments in manufacturing infrastructure underscore the growing significance of GLP-1RAs in treating diabetes, obesity, and associated conditions such as sleep apnoea and heart failure.\n\nLilly\u2019s revised 2024 guidance highlights the intense competition in the GLP-1RA market, dominated by Novo Nordisk and other emerging players. Both companies are vying for a share of the booming diabetes and weight-loss drug sector, projected to generate billions in revenue over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly is advancing its portfolio with an oral obesity drug. The convenience and scalability of a pill could further strengthen Lilly\u2019s position in the market, as \u201cthere is a meaningful segment of people who prefer oral medications,\u201d according to Ricks.\n\nDespite the recent revision, Lilly remains optimistic about its long-term growth. The company has forecast 2025 sales between $58bn and $61bn, with GlobalData projecting Zepbound and Mounjaro to generate $27.6bn and $35bn in annual sales, respectively, by 2030.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nEli Lilly is focusing on expanding access to obesity treatments while leveraging new therapeutic indications and ensuring pricing stability across its portfolio. Beyond incretin-based drugs, the company is driving growth in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience, demonstrating diversification in its revenue streams. The company plans to release its full Q4 2024 results on 6 February 2025.\n\nElsewhere at the conference, Amgen announced how it hopes to become a major market player in the obesity space with its therapy MariTide. The company hopes the drug\u2019s once-monthly dosing regimen and the company\u2019s manufacturing capabilities will make it a major player in the sector.",

            "content": "There's still a lot to like about Eli Lilly (LLY) stock, an analyst said Wednesday after the weight-loss drugs kingpin cut its fourth-quarter sales guidance by 5%.\n\nEli Lilly now expects $13.5 billion in fourth-quarter sales, roughly $400 million below the low end of its previous guidance. That includes $3.5 billion for type 2 diabetes drug Mounjaro and $1.9 billion for the weight-loss drug Zepbound.\n\nEvery element missed Wall Street's forecast.\n\n\"It's always disappointing to miss on expectations,\" Chief Executive David Ricks said during the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. \"We own that. It's our job to give good guidance to the Street. And we aim to land within that guidance normally.\"\n\nThe Street has lofty expectations for drugs like Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy. J.P. Morgan forecasts obesity drugs will be worth north of $100 billion by 2030.\n\n\"I think we're dealing with a kind of a business here that is pretty unprecedented in our sector in terms of size and scale and growth rate,\" Ricks added.\n\nEli Lilly Stock: What's There To Like?\n\nLeerink Partners analyst David Risinger stayed upbeat.\n\n\"Although this is the second quarter in a row of disappointing results, we expect 2025+ financial performance and pipeline newsflow (specifically oral GLP-1 orforglipron Ph3 results) to be encouraging,\" he said in a report.\n\nHe kept his outperform rating on Eli Lilly stock.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lilly shares gained a fraction, closing at 746.74. That followed a 7% dive on Tuesday after Eli Lilly updated its guidance. The company also said it expects 2025 sales to be in the range of $58 billion to $61 billion, up 32% at the midpoint vs. 2024 guidance.\n\nSleep Apnea Could Drive Zepbound\n\nZepbound just won Food and Drug Administration approval to treat obstructive sleep apnea. That should lead to insurance reimbursement, at least, for people with Medicare coverage, Risinger said. Today, Medicare can't reimburse a patient for the cost of a weight-loss drug unless it treats another condition like sleep apnea or reduces the risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nLilly estimates there are 20 million Americans with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. About 18.5% of the U.S. population is over the age of 65. This means there are about 3.7 million people in the Medicare age group who have moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nRisinger sees the sleep apnea population as a \"substantial revenue opportunity\" for Eli Lilly.\n\nStill, he cut his price target on Eli Lilly stock to 950 from 970.\n\nExpanding Weight-Loss Drugs Abroad\n\nFurther, Zepbound topped rival Wegovy from Novo in a recent head-to-head study. Zepbound patients lost up to 20.2% of their body weight, while Wegovy recipients lost 13.7% of their body weight over 72 weeks.\n\nThe company is also working on launching Zepbound in China, India and Latin America. Those will be self-pay markets initially. Keeping up with demand could be a challenge, though. There are about 400 million people with obesity in China.\n\n\"(Management) said the company needs to make sure that when it triggers a launch in China, it has the capacity and doesn't cause disruptions for the remainder of the markets,\" Risinger said.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nJohnson & Johnson Buys Intra-Cellular Therapeutics In A Whopping $14.6 Billion Deal\n\nJ&J Falls \u2014 While Boston Scientific, Medtronic Pop \u2014 After Strokes Sideline A Key Product\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) is the most valuable healthcare stock in the world, with a market capitalization of around $720 billion. For a while, it looked like it might be on track to be the first healthcare company to top a $1 trillion valuation, perhaps as early as this year.\n\nBut over the past three months, the stock has fallen by 14% as the recent election results don't appear to be inspiring much enthusiasm around the business. Fears of heightened oversight in the industry could weigh on not just Eli Lilly, but healthcare stocks as a whole. Plus, there is also the concern that the stock's high valuation may finally be catching up to it.\n\nHas Eli Lilly's stock indeed peaked, and could this be the start of a much broader sell-off, or is now a potentially good time to add the healthcare giant to your portfolio?\n\nWhy Eli Lilly investors should remain bullish\n\nThere's been growing concern in the healthcare industry of late as investors worry about whether the new government may put in more restrictive measures on GLP-1 drugs and whether there will be greater scrutiny around vaccines.\n\nFor investors, however, the focus should always be on the long term. Government policies and regulations are uncontrollable and the good news is that for a business such as Eli Lilly, which is developing potentially life-changing treatments for patients, it's in a great position to grow its sales and profits for years to come.\n\nIn Eli Lilly's most recent quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, 2024, it grew its sales by 20% to $11.4 billion. It also had multiple products that generated over $1 billion in revenue, including its top GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro ($3.1 billion) and Zepbound ($1.3 billion). Late last year, regulators approved Zepbound as a treatment option for adults with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It's a significant development as that could lead to more prescriptions and prove to be a catalyst for more revenue growth for the business in the near future.\n\nWith Eli Lilly posting strong financials and its top GLP-1 drugs still in their early growth stages, there are plenty of reasons to remain bullish on the stock when looking at it over the long haul.\n\nHow big of a problem is Eli Lilly's valuation?\n\nThe biggest concern with Eli Lilly stock may come back to its valuation. Investors have been paying a premium for the business due to its fantastic growth prospects in the anti-obesity market. But a multiple of 86 times its trailing earnings could be a tough valuation to justify for investors right now.\n\nThe good news is that when you factor in future earnings, the price may not be as steep. Based on analyst expectations, Eli Lilly is trading at 35 times next year's profits. While that may still seem high, it does suggest that given a high level of growth, its valuation should become more tenable in the future.\n\nAnd when you're looking even further ahead, at the next five years, the valuation may be even more justifiable as Eli Lilly stock trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) multiple of around 0.75. Anything below a PEG of 1 is generally considered a good deal. Based on its longer-term valuation metrics, I'd argue that Eli Lilly may not be that expensive.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Eli Lilly stock?\n\nEli Lilly still looks poised to hit the $1 trillion market cap in the future, and I think it's just a matter of when rather than if it will happen. And that's why it can still make for a good buy today. Its attractive opportunities in the GLP-1 drug market make it one of the better growth stocks to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nInvestors shouldn't worry too much about government policies and regulations as they aren't likely to weigh down the business in the long run. There is always going to be a need for advancements in healthcare and for companies to develop new drugs, and Eli Lilly has proven to be a leader on both fronts, which is why it can be one of the safer long-term investments to hang on to.\n\nIf you can get the stock at any kind of a discount, you shouldn't hesitate to take it. I think Eli Lilly's valuation can rise a whole lot higher. While it may be down in recent months, that doesn't mean it has peaked; the stock still has a lot of upside.",

That\u2019s how much Eli Lilly\u2019s revenue grew in 2024, but it was still not as much as the company or investors expected, which had CEO David Ricks trying to assuage investors.\n\nLilly on Tuesday revised its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter to about $13.5 billion, which is about $400 million less than the company\u2019s previous revenue projection. The company attributed the revision to lower-than-expected sales of tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always disappointing to miss your own expectations,\u201d Ricks said during a presentation Tuesday at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. \u201cWe own that, it\u2019s our job to give good guidance to the street, and we aim to land within that guidance normally. That said, we\u2019re dealing with a business year that is pretty unprecedented in our sector, in terms of size, and scale and growth rate.\u201d\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nThe Lilly metabolic medicines are still tremendous drivers of revenue. The company expects Mounjaro will tally about $3.5 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 while Zepbound revenue will be about $1.9 billion. The company\u2019s previous fourth quarter revenue guidance was based on expectations of faster revenue growth for the period.\n\nRicks cited several reasons for the lower-than-expected sales of the incretin mimetics, engineered peptides that work by mimicking gut hormones. December sales usually outperform the rest of the fourth quarter. That did not happen last month for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Ricks said the difference could be changes in Medicare Part D and insurance, keeping patients from doing two prescriptions in the same month. The company also had lower-than-expected amount of the drugs in stock at the end of the year. Ricks dismissed suggestions that the missed guidance indicates a slowdown in adoption of the metabolic medicines.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re in the early innings of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is limits on demand for each category. I think the incretin story, the tirzepatide story, is going to be about unlocking new categories over and over again.\u201d\n\nBeyond revenue growth in diabetes and obesity, Lilly\u2019s strategy includes expanding use of tirzepatide to other indications. In late December, the FDA approved Zepbound as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, which represents another potential blockbuster market. Lilly is also studying tirzepatide in cardiovascular indications and the fatty liver disease MASH.\n\nSponsored Post Tackling Messy Provider Data with an NPI-Forward Approach Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.\n\nLeerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a research note that despite the second straight quarter of lower-than-expected revenue figures, he expects Lilly\u2019s 2025 financial performance and pipeline news \u2014 specifically the Phase 3 results for oral GLP-1 drug orforglipron \u2014 will be encouraging.\n\nPhoto: Craig F.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"",

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Company LLY dropped 6.6% in the Jan. 14 trading session after slashing its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, citing lower-than-expected sales for its weight-loss medicine Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. However, the drugmaker offered solid guidance for 2025, underscoring the strong growth prospects.\n\n\n\nInvestors seeking to buy the dip could bet on ETFs having the largest exposure to the drugmaker. These include iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Roundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF OZEM, Horizon Kinetics Medical ETF MEDX, Amplify Weight Loss Drug & Treatment ETF THNR and VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH.\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant expects revenues to be about $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter, approximately $400 million below the guidance range it issued at the end of October. The new guidance includes revenues of about $3.5 billion for Mounjaro and $1.9 billion for Zepbound and represents 45% growth from the year-ago quarter. Eli Lilly also cut its revenue guidance for full-year 2024 to $45 billion from the previous expectation of $45.4-$46 billion. The new outlook still indicates 32% year-over-year growth in revenues. The drugmaker expects to report full quarterly results on Feb. 6 (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).\n\n\n\nThe company offered a bullish outlook for 2025. Heading into fiscal 2025, CEO David Ricks said Eli Lilly expects sales of weight-loss drugs to continue growing. He noted that the company will add more manufacturing capacity and expects to produce at least 60% more sellable doses of its incretin drugs in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2024.\n\n\n\nThe drugmaker anticipates revenues between $58 billion and $61 billion in fiscal 2025. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $60.26 billion. Major contributors to 2025 revenues will be new LLY medicines such as Jaypirca, Ebglyss, Omvoh and Kisunla, approvals of new indications for existing Lilly medicines, launches of Mounjaro in additional worldwide markets, as well as potential launches of new medicines - imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\niShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE)\n\n\n\niShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF offers exposure to 42 companies that manufacture prescription or over-the-counter drugs or vaccines by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index.

Volume is lower as it exchanges about 64,000 shares a day. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.\n\n\n\nRoundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF (OZEM)\n\n\n\nRoundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF is the world\u2019s first GLP-1 ETF and is actively managed.

Roundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF has accumulated $39.5 million in its asset base and charges 59 bps in annual fees. It trades in an average daily volume of 29,00 shares.\n\n\n\nHorizon Kinetics Medical ETF (MEDX)\n\n\n\nHorizon Kinetics Medical ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests primarily in patented first-line pharmaceuticals and biologics, as these products tend to have high-profit margins and significant barriers to entry.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nEli Lilly on Tuesday said the company\u2019s revenue in 2024 totaled about $45 billion, a 32% jump on 2023\u2019s total but less than what it had estimated in October.\n\nThird quarter sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound, its GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and obesity, were below Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations at $3.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. CEO David Ricks said GLP-1 market growth was slower than the company anticipated.\n\nShares of the Indianapolis-based company fell by as much as 8% in morning trading, shaving tens of billions of dollars from its market valuation. Since hitting a high of $960 apiece in late August, shares have tumbled in value by about one-fifth as Zepbound sales have fallen short of forecasts.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly should be in position to dominate the market for so-called \u201cincretin\u201d drugs that treat diabetes, obesity and metabolic disease. Zepbound beat its immediate rival, Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy, in a head-to-head trial, and Novo\u2019s closest follow-up drug missed expectations in a Phase 3 trial.\n\nBut Lilly\u2019s struggles to boost supply quickly enough to meet demand, along with uncertainty about the long-term market as some data show most people stop taking the drugs within a year, have overshadowed its successes. Zepbound\u2019s miss was predicted by Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari, who in a Jan. 3 note to clients pointed to sliding prescription totals in late December.\n\nLilly had estimated annual revenue would fall between $45.4 billion and $46 billion when it reported third quarter earnings in late October. The eventual $400 million shortfall came in the fourth quarter, the company said. Still, full-year revenue was $4 billion above what Lilly anticipated in February 2024.\n\nThe announcement came hours before Ricks was scheduled to appear at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Investors are likely to want to hear greater detail about Lilly\u2019s views on the obesity market and how it will grow moving forward.\n\nFor 2025, Lilly forecast revenue growth of 32%, equal to 2024\u2019s growth rate, with sales reaching between $58 billion and $61 billion.\n\n\u201cSales of Mounjaro and Zepbound posted robust sales growth in Q4, and we expect a continuation of that trend into 2025,\u201d said Ricks in a statement. \u201cWe'll also bring additional manufacturing capacity online and expect to produce at least 60% more salable doses of [GLP-1s] in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2024.\u201d\n\nLeerink Partners analyst David Risinger, who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Lilly stock, acknowledged it was the second straight quarter the company delivered disappointing results. However, he wrote in a Tuesday note to clients that he expects better results in 2025. Additional pipeline drugs, including a follow-on oral GLP-1 for obesity, should provide sales growth for future years, he added.\n\nLilly\u2019s guidance weighed on shares of other companies developing GLP-1 drugs, including Viking Therapeutics, which fell by more than 10%, and Novo Nordisk, which dropped 5%.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways The S&P 500 added 0.1% on Tuesday, Jan. 14, as tame wholesale inflation data provided a positive signal ahead of Wednesday's consumer price report.\n\nEli Lilly shares plunged after the pharma giant cut its sales guidance, suggesting its popular diabetes and weight-loss treatments could fall short of huge demand expectations.\n\nShares of United Rentals took off as the company signed a deal to buy fellow construction and industrial equipment provider H&E Equipment Services.\n\nMajor U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Tuesday after the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) data showed a lighter-than-expected uptick in wholesale prices for December. The soft PPI report helped alleviate some concerns about the stickiness of inflation heading into Wednesday morning's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nThe S&P 500 was volatile during the session, fluctuating above and below its opening level before closing with a minimal 0.1% gain. The Dow jumped 0.5%, boosted by outperformance from several of its industrial components, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.2%.\n\nAmong top S&P 500 gainers Tuesday, construction and industrial equipment provider United Rentals (URI) inked a $4.8 billion deal to acquire fellow heavy-duty equipment rental company H&E Equipment Services (HEES). United Rentals said the planned acquisition reflects its strategy to grow its core business, with H&E's assets boosting its capacity in key U.S. markets. United Rentals shares added 5.9%, notching the strongest gains of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, while H&E shares skyrocketed, more than doubling in value.\n\n\n\nShares of industrial chemical manufacturer Celanese (CE) jumped 5.4% after Bank of America upgraded its view on the stock to \"buy\" from \"underperform.\" Analysts attributed the double upgrade to the stock's enticing valuation and expectations for an improvement in the acetyls market. In addition to anticipating a recovery in demand for Celanese's products, especially in India, the BofA team noted strong free cash flow should help the chemical maker address debt leverage issues.\n\nFresh off massive 2024 gains of more than 250% that made the electricity generator's stock one of the year's top S&P 500 performers, Vistra (VST) shares added 5.2% on Tuesday. On Monday, Zacks Equities Research highlighted Vistra stock as its \"bull of the day,\" reiterating the utility's opportunity to meet high levels of energy demand from artificial intelligence data centers and noting that consensus estimates suggest that Vistra's already-impressive earnings growth trajectory could accelerate this year.\n\nA positive update from Bank of America also helped lift GE Vernova (GEV) stock, which gained 4.2% Tuesday. BofA analysts boosted their price target on shares of the energy equipment firm, which separated from General Electric last year. This reflects a positive view of GE Vernova's position in the gas turbine market, which has benefited from strong pricing trends in recent years.\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) reduced its full-year revenue outlook, indicating that demand for its diabetes and weight-loss treatments Mounjaro and Zepbound could fall short of elevated expectations. The company has been investing heavily to ramp up manufacturing capacity as it aims to meet surging demand for blockbuster drugs. Eli Lilly shares tumbled 6.6%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock for the day.\n\nShares of Charles River Laboratories (CRL) sank 6.3% after the preclinical and clinical medical research firm issued underwhelming preliminary earnings guidance for 2025. Charles River said it expects full-year organic revenue to decline at a similar pace as last year, forecasting stable to slightly improving demand from biotechnology companies but limited demand from large pharmaceutical firms. In the wake of the updated forecasts, analysts at JPMorgan and Bank of America reiterated their \"neutral\" ratings on Charles River stock.\n\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS) shares dropped about 4% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the casino operator's stock to \"equal weight\" and trimmed its price target. Analysts cited a deceleration of customer growth trends in Singapore and more limited expectations for economic growth in China as factors that could weigh on the resort and gaming company's performance.",

The drug is in clinical studies evaluating its potential in solid tumours and breast cancer in particular. As per the company, STX-478 could avoid affecting healthy human cells and selectively target cancer cells, paving the way for better tolerability.\n\nAs per the deal terms outlined in a 13 January announcement, the new spinout company with its non-PI3K\u03b1 assets will be owned by Scorpion\u2019s existing shareholders and Lilly will hold a minority equity stake in it. The news was announced amid a steady trickle of deals announced in the last few days, including one involving another oncology biotech\u2014that of the Johnson and Johnson acquiring Intracellular Therapies. Pharma and biotech investors are expected to engage in rapid deal making in the next few days at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference 2025, which started today [13 January].\n\nEli Lilly already has market share in the breast cancer space with the approved drug Verzenio (abemaciclib), and is advancing investigational drugs like the oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) imlunestrant.\n\nWith its latest acquisition, Lilly will carve out a spot in the PI3K inhibitors space in breast cancer, which for long was dominated by Novartis\u2019 Piqray (alpelisib). In October 2024, Roche had a significant win with the approval of its PI3K inhibitor Itovebi (inavolisib) in combination with Pfizer\u2019s Ibrance (palbociclib) and AstraZeneca\u2019s Faslodex (fulvestrant) as the first-line treatment for certain breast cancer patients. The drug is expected to yield 1.3bn in revenues as early as 2030, as per a consensus forecast by GlobalData, the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nPI3K inhibitors are directed toward the subset of breast cancer that are hormone receptor (HR)+.\n\nOncology is expected to be a key area of development in 2025 having been the top therapy area with an estimated CAGR of $232,271 bn in 2024, as per GlobalData\u2019s State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry report. Oncology trials will outnumber CNS and cardiovascular trials, with the most planned clinical trials for 2025 are for solid tumours, followed by pain, as per the report.",

(\"Scorpion\"), a private biotechnology company developing small molecule precision oncology therapies, today announced a definitive agreement for Lilly to acquire Scorpion's PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor program STX-478. STX-478 is a once-daily oral, mutant-selective PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for breast cancer and other advanced solid tumors.\n\nSTX-478 could represent the next generation of PI3K\u03b1 targeting agents by selectively targeting the pathway in cancerous but not healthy cells, thus overcoming a key limitation of currently available medicines that target the PI3K\u03b1 pathway. This approach could potentially offer better disease control through deeper pathway inhibition, as well as improved tolerability.\n\n\"PI3K\u03b1 mutations occur in a meaningful proportion of hormone-positive breast cancers, and there is significant unmet need for new treatment options that effectively and safely target this pathway,\" said Jacob Van Naarden , executive vice president and president of Lilly Oncology. \"The selectivity profile of STX-478 has led to a differentiated clinical profile, enabling use in combinations with standard-of-care therapies to potentially deliver meaningful impact in earlier treatment settings when there is the best opportunity to improve outcomes for patients. We look forward to leveraging the great work of the Scorpion team to date, along with Lilly's deep expertise in breast cancer, to further advance STX-478 with speed and focus.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Lilly will acquire Scorpion and Scorpion shareholders could receive up to $2.5 billion in cash, inclusive of an upfront payment and subsequent payments upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones. Additionally, as part of the transaction, Scorpion will spin out a new entity to hold its employees and non-PI3K\u03b1 pipeline assets. The new, independent company would be owned by Scorpion's current shareholders with Lilly holding a minority equity interest. The new company will be led by Dr. Friedman and members of the current Scorpion management team and will focus on discovering and delivering a portfolio of precision medicines to patients, accelerated by Scorpion's discovery capabilities and non-PI3K\u03b1 pipeline of medicines.\n\n\"Lilly has advanced scientific breakthroughs for some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers,\" said Adam Friedman , M.D., Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Scorpion. \"We believe Lilly's global capabilities and strategic commitment to patients with breast cancer will accelerate our goal of developing STX-478 to improve outcomes for the many patients with solid tumors driven by PI3K\u03b1 mutations. This acquisition is a testament to the expertise of the Scorpion team and our drug discovery capabilities, which will become the foundation of our new company.\"\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Lilly will determine the accounting treatment of this transaction in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) upon closing. This transaction will thereafter be reflected in Lilly's financial results and financial guidance.\n\nFor Lilly, Citi is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Ropes & Gray LLP is acting as legal counsel. For Scorpion, Centerview Partners LLC is acting as lead financial advisor with additional financial advisory from Morgan Stanley, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is acting as legal counsel.\n\nAbout Scorpion Therapeutics\n\nScorpion is a clinical-stage, precision oncology company developing transformational targeted therapies for patients with cancer.

Morgan Healthcare Conference kicked off Monday in San Francisco, and now Eli Lilly has joined the fray, setting down $1 billion up front for Scorpion Therapeutics\u2019 PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor program in a bid to bolster its own cancer pipeline.\n\nThe deal, which includes an additional $1.5 billion upon the clearance of regulatory hurdles and sales milestones, confirms reporting from BMO Capital Markets last week suggesting that Lilly was kicking the tires around Scorpion.\n\nScorpion\u2019s program, STX-478, is a novel small molecule that binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha (PI3K\u03b1), one of the most commonly mutated genes across all cancer types, occurring in approximately 14% of all cancers. What sets the asset apart, according to Scorpion , is its semi-novel mechanism of action, where it binds to PI3K, a recurring target, but at a novel binding site. STX-478 is currently in Phase I/II trials for breast cancer and other solid tumors.\n\nLilly\u2019s hope is that STX-478\u2019s novel behavior, targeting mutations in PI3K\u03b1 at a novel site, will circumvent the safety and toxicity issues that have dogged other drugs targeting the pathway.\n\n\u201cThe selectivity profile of STX-478 has led to a differentiated clinical profile, enabling use in combinations with standard-of-care therapies to potentially deliver meaningful impact in earlier treatment settings when there is the best opportunity to improve outcomes for patients,\u201d Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president and president of Lilly Oncology, said in a statement.\n\nScorpion president and CEO Adam Friedman also addressed the transaction in the same press release, saying, \u201cWe believe Lilly\u2019s global capabilities and strategic commitment to patients with breast cancer will accelerate our goal of developing STX-478 to improve outcomes for the many patients with solid tumors driven by PI3K\u03b1 mutations.\u201d\n\nLilly is not acquiring all of Scorpion. The Indiana-based pharma is getting the PI3K portion of the company and the name \u201cScorpion,\u201d while Scorpion itself will spin out its employees and non-PI3K work into a new entity, whose name was not announced. The new company will be owned by Scorpion\u2019s shareholders, with Lilly retaining a minority stake.\n\nBecause of its common role across cancers, PI3K is one of the most popular targets for the biopharma and oncology sector, but the class has seen mixed results. As recently as 2022, companies developing PI3K inhibitors saw large layoffs , withdrawn products with incomplete trials , and abandoned assets , in addition to an FDA advisory committee vote to shut down single-arm clinical studies of new PI3K inhibitors due to safety issues, toxicity and side effect concerns, instead recommending randomized trials.",

So-called PI3Ka mutations are among the most common drivers of cancer, affecting more than 160,000 people diagnosed each year with breast, gynecological and head and neck cancers in the U.S., according to Scorpion.\n\nA handful of medicines already available, like Novartis\u2019 Piqray and AstraZeneca\u2019s Truqap, as well as others in clinical development also target PI3Ka mutations.\n\nScorpion has claimed its drug could be more selective and potent than existing PI3Ka inhibitors, which block normal, or \u201cwild-type,\u201d PI3Ka and as a result are tough to tolerate. Existing drugs also don\u2019t readily reach the brain tissue into which many solid tumors spread. Scorpion says its drug might overcome these limitations and has advanced the treatment into a Phase 1/2 trial in multiple tumor types, among them a common form of breast cancer.\n\nScorpion has been collaborating with Pfizer to study STX-678 together with a so-called CDK4 inhibitor. Lilly sells a drug, called Verzenio, that similarly targets CDK4 alongside a related protein.\n\nThe deal will expand a cancer drug division Lilly has poured considerable resources into as a complement to its lucrative metabolic disease business. Lilly acquired Loxo Oncology in 2019 and, since then, has used deals to buy into other areas of precision oncology such as radiopharmaceuticals and antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nVerzenio, which Lilly discovered and developed internally, has become the top-selling drug of its class, though much of Lilly\u2019s revenue is derived from its diabetes and weight loss treatments. Lilly also has in its pipeline an internally developed PI3Ka inhibitor that\u2019s in Phase 1 testing.\n\nLilly\u2019s deal with Scorpion adds to an upward trend in private biotech M&A. The increase has coincided with a weakening market for initial public offerings, which as forced many mature startups to explore strategic options.\n\nScorpion was co-founded in 2020 by Gary Glick, who helped the company raise nearly $300 million in venture funding before departing in 2021. Prior to Scorpion, Glick led Lycera, which inked a 2015 deal with Celgene, and IFM Therapeutics, which has spun off multiple companies that were acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis.\n\nGlick\u2019s latest company, Odyssey Therapeutics, is developing treatments for inflammatory diseases.",

            "content": "While Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 14% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. To be precise, the stock price is 473% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. Arguably, the recent fall is to be expected after such a strong rise. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Eli Lilly\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Eli Lilly achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 42% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 86.05.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nNYSE:LLY Earnings Per Share Growth January 12th 2025\n\nWe know that Eli Lilly has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Eli Lilly the TSR over the last 5 years was 511%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nEli Lilly provided a TSR of 25% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 44% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Eli Lilly a stock worth watching. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Eli Lilly you should know about.",

(NASDAQ: BIOA) and certain of its senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in BioAge, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nInvestors have until March 10, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of investors who purchased stock pursuant and/or traceable to BioAge\u2019s registration statement for its initial public offering held on or about September 26, 2024. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Soto v. BioAge Labs, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-196.\n\nWhy was BioAge Sued under the Federal Securities Laws?\n\nBioAge Labs, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of therapeutic products for metabolic diseases, with a primary focus on obesity. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, azelaprag, is an orally available small-molecule agonist of the apelin receptor (APJ), designed to enhance weight loss.\n\nAs alleged, BioAge\u2019s IPO documents discussed its ongoing STRIDES Phase 2 trial of azelaprag in combination with GLP-1R agonists for enhanced weight loss. BioAge stated that it was collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cLilly\u201d) in connection with STRIDES, and that Lilly would be advising and assisting on all aspects of the trial\u2019s design and execution. BioAge also stated that it anticipated topline results in Q3 2025 and discussed the potential for a second Phase 2 clinical trial. As alleged, BioAge\u2019s statements conveyed to investors that there were no safety concerns and that it expected top line results to meet its primary endpoint goals.\n\nIn truth, BioAge was forced to discontinue the STRIDES Phase 2 trial after several subjects exhibited elevated liver enzyme levels, indicating potential organ damage. Consequently, the Company terminated the trial and ceased further enrollment.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn December 6, 2024, BioAge announced that it discontinued its STRIDES Phase 2 trial for azelaprag, citing safety concerns, after liver transaminitis was observed in subjects receiving azelaprag. The Company stated that the decision to discontinue the STRIDES trial of azelaprag \u201cbecame clear\u201d due to \u201cthe emerging safety profile of the current doses tested[.]\u201d This news caused the price of BioAge stock to decline over 76%, from a closing price of $20.09 per share on December 6, 2024, to $4.65 per share on December 9, 2024.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/bioage-labs-inc.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in BioAge you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

            "content": "As of the end of 2024, SCHG has delivered an annualized three-year return of 11.4 % , an annualized five-year return of 19.8%, and an annualized 10-year return of 16.7 % . These returns beat those of the broader market over each time frame as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), a good stand-in for the broader market and an ETF that has produced strong returns itself, delivered an annualized three-year return of 8.9%, an annualized five-year return of 14.5%, and an annualized 10-year return of 13.1% as of the same date.\n\nAnother reason SCHG is a top choice for new investors is that it has generated strong returns over a long period of time.\n\nSCHG\u2019s top holdings are also rated highly by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human intervention. Seven of SCHG\u2019s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nAs you can see, SCHG has positions in many of the market\u2019s most dominant stocks, including the magnificent seven plus other powerhouses like Broadcom (AVGO) and Eli Lilly (LLY). These are many of the most dynamic and innovative companies in the U.S., not to mention the world, with exposure to compelling long-term themes like artificial intelligence , quantum computing , autonomous vehicles, and more, making them good propositions for long-term investors.\n\nIt offers investors exposure to a basket of 227 companies that make up the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an ETF to start out with, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF is a good place to begin. This growth-oriented ETF from Charles Schwab was launched in 2009 and now has $37.7 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nHere are three of the best ETFs to consider as you set out on your path as an investor \u2013 the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG), the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). All three offer diversified exposure to great stocks, varying levels of strong returns over the years, and, importantly, low fees.\n\nLooking to get started on your investing journey in 2025? Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great place to start, as they offer diversified exposure to a wide group of the market\u2019s best stocks in one simple, convenient instrument.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, SCHG is delivering this market-beating performance for a very low price. Its expense ratio of 0.06%, means that an investor in the fund will pay just $6 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIs SCHG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SCHG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 195 Buys, 31 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SCHG stock price target of $31.92 implies 13.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m bullish on SCHG and consider it a great building block for new investors (and all investors for that matter) based on its strong portfolio of highly-rated stocks, its history of outperforming the market to generate compelling returns, and its ultra-low expense ratio.\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)\n\nLike SCHG, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is another offering from blue-chip asset manager Charles Schwab (SCHW). SCHD debuted in 2011 and has grown to $65.8 billion in AUM.\n\nWhile SCHG focuses on growth stocks, SCHD is instead focused on dividend stocks.\n\nThe fund owns a portfolio of 101 dividend stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 41.1% of assets. You can check out an overview of SCHD\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nWhile SCHG caters towards the more growth-oriented part of the market, SCHD hones in on tried-and-true dividend stocks like healthcare giants Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV), soft drink giants Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) and even BlackRock (BLK), the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nThese companies have been paying and, in many cases, growing their dividends for many years. Because they hail from more defensive parts of the market like healthcare, consumer staples, and financials, these holdings, and by extension SCHD itself, should hold up better than the market as a whole during a market pullback as these sectors typically feature lower valuations and more defensive business models.\n\nSHCD features an attractive dividend yield of 3.6%, which is nearly triple the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) yield of 1.3%. Newer investors can reinvest these above-average dividends to create a snowball effect and slowly but surely build up their positions in SCHD over time.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that SCHD has slightly underperformed the market over time, but its results have still been quite positive, and it may outperform the broader market if there is a rotation from growth stocks to more defensive names like those that SCHD specializes in. As of December 31, SCHD has posted an annualized three-year return of 4.2%, an annualized five-year return of 11.1%, and an annualized 10-year return of 11.0%. For comparison, the aforementioned VOO has generated better returns over the comparable periods.\n\nLike SCHG, SCHD sports a favorable expense ratio of just 0.06%, meaning an investor will pay just $6 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment in the fund.\n\nIs SCHD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SCHG earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 55 Buys, 41 Holds, and five Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SCHD stock price target of $31.31 implies 14.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SCHD as another great choice for new investors based on its diversified portfolio of blue-chip dividend stocks, its attractive above-average dividend yield, and its favorable expense ratio.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)\n\nLast but not least, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is another powerhouse ETF for beginners to consider.\n\nWith $321 billion in AUM, QQQ is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the world, and with good reason. It invests in the Nasdaq 100 (NDX), an index of the 100 largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nThe Nasdaq has long been associated with top tech and growth stocks, so the ETF and its holdings skew heavily in this direction. QQQ owns 102 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 52.2% of assets. You\u2019ll find an overview of QQQ\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nAs you can see, QQQ\u2019s top holdings look fairly similar to the growth-oriented SCHG\u2019s, with Costco (COST) replacing Eli Lilly (LLY). These holdings give investors significant exposure to secular trends like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, autonomous driving, and more. Seven of these top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores, with QQQ itself earning an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nQQQ\u2019s long-term track record of outperforming the market is what truly sets it apart as a can\u2019t-miss investment opportunity. The powerhouse ETF has outperformed the market over each of the past three-, five- and 10-year time frames, racking up the best returns in this group of three strong ETFs in the process.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, QQQ had generated an annualized three-year return of 9.5%, an excellent annualized five-year return of 20.0%, and an impressive annualized 10-year return of 18.3%. For comparison, QQQ has outperformed VOO over these three periods.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.20%, QQQ is the most expensive of the ETFs in this group but still reasonably priced and well below the average expense ratio for all ETFs. An investor in the fund will pay just $20 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIs QQQ Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, QQQ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 91 Buys, 11 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average QQQ stock price target of $584.51 implies 13.4% upside potential from current levels.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on QQQ based on its stellar long-term performance, its portfolio of top tech and growth stocks, and its reasonable expense ratio.\n\nThree Great Building Blocks for Investors\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get started investing in 2025, ETFs are a great way to get the ball rolling, as they give you instant exposure to a wide array of the market\u2019s top stocks. I\u2019m bullish on all three of these ETFs as excellent building blocks for investors to use and start building their portfolios around.\n\nAll three feature diversified portfolios of blue-chip stocks and reasonable expense ratios. I\u2019m bullish on SCHG and QQQ based on their portfolios of top tech and growth stocks, exposure to exciting long-term themes, and their long histories of outperforming the broader market. Meanwhile, I\u2019m bullish on SCHD as a strong complement to these names based on its more defensive portfolio and attractive dividend yield.\n\nDisclosure",

Manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company, Zepbound offers a new approach to managing OSA symptoms while also promoting significant weight loss.\n\nWhat Is Zepbound?\n\nZepbound is an injectable prescription medication created to help adults with obesity and weight-related problems, including obstructive sleep apnea. OSA causes airway collapses during sleep and symptoms include snoring, fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness. If left untreated, OSA can lead to serious health complications like cardiovascular issues and cognitive impairments.\n\n\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAccording to a recent news release, Eli Lilly's clinical trials for Zepbound showed promising results. After one year, patients experienced an average of 25 fewer breathing interruptions per hour. Furthermore, up to 50% of participants no longer exhibited symptoms of OSA. The medication also promotes weight loss, with patients losing an average of 45 pounds or 18% of their body weight, during the trials.\n\n\"Too often, OSA is brushed off as \u2018just snoring'\u2014but it's far more than that,\" Julie Flygare, president and CEO of Project Sleep, said in the news release. \"We hope this will spark more meaningful conversations between patients and health care providers and ultimately lead to better health outcomes.\"\n\nHow Does Zepbound Work?\n\nZepbound is a dual-activating medication that combines glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mechanisms to tackle the root causes of obesity. It suppresses appetite and reduces caloric intake, making it particularly effective for individuals whose OSA symptoms are exacerbated by excess weight.\n\nSee Also: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nThe drug can be used with or without CPAP treatment. While Zepbound alone showed significant efficacy, patients combining it with PAP therapy saw even greater benefits, including a higher likelihood of symptom remission.\n\nWhat Does Zepbound Cost?\n\nLilly Investors have listed Zepbound for $1,086.37 per fill. But the actual costs will vary depending on each patient's insurance coverage of prescription drugs. Those who have commercial drug insurance may qualify to pay as low as $25 for a one to three-month supply of Zepbound. For those whose commercial drug insurance does not cover Zepbound, they may be eligible to pay $650 for a one-month supply of the drug.\n\nWithout insurance, patients would need to pay the full price, plus additional pharmacy charges that may apply.\n\nEli Lilly has stated its commitment to making the drug accessible, offering savings programs to eligible patients and planning to release more data on average out-of-pocket costs in the coming months.\n\nTrending: I\u2019m 62 Years Old And Have $1.2 Million Saved. Is This Enough to Retire Stress-Free?\n\nWill Insurance Cover Zepbound?\n\nThere will likely be insurance coverage for Zepbound as a sleep apnea treatment; however, as a newly approved medication, specific insurance pricing is not currently available. It may also take time for insurers to determine how it fits into their formularies. It is also good to note that insurance coverage for this medication will vary depending on your policies.\n\nLilly Investors encourages patients to consult with their health care providers and insurers to explore coverage options and eligibility for savings programs.\n\nThe FDA's approval of Zepbound provides a new approach to treatment for Americans who struggle with OSA and obesity. Patients considering Zepbound should discuss the potential benefits, risks and costs with their doctors.\n\nRead Next:",

MTX-463 is a first-in-class human IgG1 antibody designed to neutralize WISP1-mediated fibrotic signaling in several debilitating diseases. The Phase 1 study was recently completed in healthy volunteers and showed MTX-463 to be well-tolerated and engaged WISP1 at all tested doses. The Phase 2 IPF study is designed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in patients. The trial is expected to initiate in the first half of 2025 and will be conducted by Mediar. Following completion of the Phase 2 study, Lilly will have the right to lead all further clinical development and commercialization of the program.\n\n\"This collaboration supports our unique myofibroblast-directed approach to treating fibrotic diseases and our mission to bring first-in-class therapies to patients with high unmet medical need,\" said Rahul Ballal, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Mediar Therapeutics. \"By combining Lilly's unparalleled expertise in bringing life-changing medicines to patients with our novel scientific approaches, we are excited to advance a robust Phase 2 IPF program and potentially bring new therapies that halt fibrosis.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement Mediar will receive a combined $99 million, which is inclusive of an upfront payment and near-term milestones. Mediar may receive up to an additional $687 million in potential downstream development and commercialization milestones. Additionally, Mediar is eligible to receive high-single to low-double digit royalty payments and net sales milestones based on potential future product sales.\n\n\"Mediar's scientific approach and experienced team has led to the creation of novel, potential first-in-class therapies for fibrotic diseases, including MTX-463,\" said Mark Genovese, M.D., senior vice president of Lilly Immunology development. \"The collaboration with Mediar exemplifies our dedication to fostering innovation, and we look forward to partnering with the Mediar team to advance MTX-463 through development in hopes of bringing a novel treatment option to people living with IPF.\"\n\nBeyond MTX-463, Mediar will continue to independently advance its two wholly owned programs to treat fibrotic disorders. MTX-474 is a first-in-class human IgG1 antibody designed to neutralize the EphrinB2 signaling that causes fibrosis, and is currently finishing a Phase 1 clinical study. Mediar anticipates initiating a Phase 2 trial for MTX-474 in systemic sclerosis in the second half of 2025. Mediar's third novel fibrosis program, targeting SMOC2, is also advancing with a plan to nominate a clinical candidate in the first half of 2025.\n\nAbout MTX-463\n\nMTX-463 is a first-in-class human IgG1 antibody developed against WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1). WISP1 is a secreted matricellular protein shown to have a relevant role in fibrosis progression, measurable in human blood, and correlates with disease severity. Initial data indicates that MTX-463 neutralizes WISP1-mediated fibrotic signaling that spans several fibrotic indications and significantly reduced fibrosis in vitro and in preclinical mouse models. Mediar expects to initiate a Phase 2 study in IPF with MTX-463 in 1H-2025.\n\nAbout MTX-474\n\nMTX-474 is a first-in-class human IgG1 antibody designed to neutralize the EphrinB2 signaling that causes the onset and progression of fibrosis. Ephrin ligands and Eph receptors mediate biological processes involved in tissue fibrosis including cell migration, myofibroblast activation, and tissue remodeling. A growing body of evidence has implicated EphrinB2 in the fibrosis of the skin, lungs, and heart. Expression of EphrinB2 and its receptors are measurable in human blood and correlates with disease severity. Mediar expects to initiate a Phase 2 study in SSc with MTX-474 in 2H-2025.\n\nAbout Mediar Therapeutics\n\nMediar Therapeutics is pioneering a new approach to fibrosis treatment that aims to halt the disease at a different source \u2013 the myofibroblast, the key pathogenic cell in fibrosis that drives scarring, disease progression, and ultimately organ failure. Mediar was founded based on a deep understanding of the complex science underlying fibrosis progression. By combining novel targets with reliable, easily detectable blood biomarkers and familiar modalities, Mediar's goal is to bring forward novel anti-fibrotic therapies that potentially have a precision medicine approach.

Mediar will also be able to receive high-single to low-double-digit royalties on future potential net sales.\n\nAt the core of the deal is MTX-463, a potentially first-in-class human IgG1 antibody that targets and neutralizes the WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1). Typically excreted into the extracellular environment, WISP1 plays a central role in the progression of fibrosis and is typically associated with the severity of fibrotic diseases.\n\nAccording to Mediar, early data from in vitro and mouse models suggest that inhibiting WISP-1 signaling could lower fibrosis. The biotech has recently completed a Phase I study of MTX-463 in healthy volunteers, demonstrating that the candidate could reliably engage WISP1\u2014thereby interfering with its downstream signaling\u2014while having an encouraging tolerability profile.\n\nUnder Friday\u2019s collaboration, Lilly and Mediar will push MTX-463 into Phase II development to test the antibody\u2019s potential as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a respiratory illness characterized by scarring in the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties. The partners plan to launch the mid-stage study, led by Mediar, in the first half of 2025.\n\nAfter Phase II, Lilly will assume responsibility over all further clinical development and commercialization activities for MTX-463.\n\nOutside of MTX-463, Mediar will continue to independently develop its two other fibrosis programs, including the anti-EphrinB2 antibody MTX-474 and a SMOC2 program, for which it expects to nominate a candidate in the first half of this year.\n\nThe Lilly-Mediar partnership is likely to shake up the competitive IPF space, which just months ago saw a pair of promising clinical readouts. In September 2024, Boehringer Ingelheim announced that its Phase III FIBRONEER-IPF study met its primary endpoint, showing that the investigational drug nerandomilast improves lung function in patients. At the time, the company announced that it planned to use FIBRONEER-IPF to support a drug application for nerandomilast.\n\nDays later, Insilico Medicine disclosed that its potential first-in-class small molecule drug ISM001-055 also cleared Phase IIa, with data showing that the anti-TNIK candidate elicited dose-dependent improvements in lung function.",

Millions of Americans are estimated to suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder.\n\nEli Lilly and Ozempic and Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) are testing their weight-loss drugs' abilities to treat conditions that typically accompany obesity, such as diabetes and sleep apnea. The change was first reported Wednesday by CNBC.\n\n\"This is good news for Medicare beneficiaries living with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity, particularly because there are no other pharmacological treatments for the underlying disease,\" an Eli Lilly spokesperson said in a statement to Investopedia. \"We\u2019re pleased to see Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services affirm that their guidance from last March applies to OSA.\"\n\nThe drug can also be covered by state-level Medicaid programs if it is prescribed to treat sleep apnea, and if the drug maker is part of a Medicaid drug rebate program. About 780 companies participate in the rebate program, which covers drugs under Medicaid plans in exchange for the companies paying rebates that are split between states and the federal government to offset the cost of the drugs.\n\nZepbound was approved to treat sleep apnea after clinical trials found that patients taking the drug with or without traditional sleep apnea treatments, like a mask, experienced a reduction in breathing interruptions during a night of sleep.\n\nThe Biden administration in November proposed including the weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid plans as a prescribed treatment for obesity.\n\nUPDATE: This story has been updated with a statement from Eli Lilly.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nBoth conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions.\n\nIn recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds.\n\nThe trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cThese companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won\u2019t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.\u201d\n\nValuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however.\n\n\u201cThe Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They\u2019re generating \u201ctremendous\u201d revenue for investors\u201d, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \u201cHow much more gain can be made is the question,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It\u2019s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that\u2019s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy.",

After pharma and biopharma biggies such as Amgen, Sanofi, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Zoetis, the city is now learnt to be on the radar of pharma giants such as Eli Lilly, GSK, and Merck.TOI has learnt that the US-headquartered Eli Lilly, which has a market capitalisation of over $734 billion, has already zeroed in on a facility in the heart of Hyderabad's IT hub, a stone's throw from IKEA. The global development centre (GDC) is expected to become operational by mid-2025, sources indicated. The American drug giant acquired about 2.5 lakh sq ft to 2.75 lakh sq ft of space spanning over one floor at Phoenix Equinox, where it will accommodate over 2,500 people, realty sources said. However, TOI could not get a confirmation on the development from the company at the time of going to press.Buzz about Eli Lilly's plans to set up shop in Hyderabad, which has emerged as a key global capability centres (GCC) hub for the life sciences sector, comes almost a year after Eli Lilly's global CEO David Ricks visited Hyderabad. He had delivered the keynote address at the BioAsia 2024 conclave, where he also held a meeting with Telangana industries & IT minister D Sridhar Babu. Realty sources said while players like GSK were scouting the Hyderabad market for viable options, Amgen has already acquired 6 lakh sq ft at RMZ Nexity and is scouting for more space in the city in locations such as Genome Valley.Apart from pharma and biopharma giants, Hyderabad has also seen healthcare and medtech players such as Cigna's Evernorth, HCA Healthcare, Providence, Medtronic, and Olympus Corporation set up some of their largest GCCs and global innovation centres. Telangana's lifesciences sector bagged investments worth more than Rs 36,000 crore in 2024 with 13 GCCs deciding to set up shop in the state.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe obesity market was a dominating force in 2024, with GLP-1 medications from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly becoming some of the best-selling drugs of the year. Their efficacy and widespread popularity have built a booming marketplace for weight loss therapies.\n\nAnalysts expect the space to reach a value of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years. And with so much upside, new entrants are racing into the clinic to get a piece of the action. Small biotechs and Big Pharma alike are betting on both improved GLP-1s and novel approaches.\n\nWhile only two companies currently have blockbuster obesity meds approved in the GLP-1 arena, more could be way soon. Here are some upcoming obesity trial readouts to watch in 2025.\n\nMetsera\n\nDrug: MET-097i\n\nAnticipated data readout: Mid-2025\n\nNew York-based biotech Metsera has a pipeline of oral and injectable hormone-based drug candidates that aim to address \u201cthe limitations of current therapies.\u201d Among the company\u2019s three clinical-stage programs is MET-097i, an \u201cultra-long acting\u201d injectable GLP-1 in phase 2b.\n\nOver a 12-week phase 2a study, trial participants lost an average of more than 11% of body weight with individual patients losing as much as 20%, according to data released this week. While the study dosed patients weekly, Metsera is aiming to develop MET-097i into a monthly injection down the line. Gastrointestinal adverse events \u2014 a common complaint among users of GLP-1 drugs currently on the market \u2014 were mild or moderate and short-lived.\n\n\u201cThese data strengthen our view of MET-097i as the potential first ultra-long acting GLP-1 [receptor agonist],\u201d Dr. Steve Marso, chief medical officer of Metsera, said in a statement.\n\nA monthly injectable could give Metsera a leg up on competitors with a more convenient weight loss regimen. Metsera is also chasing an oral GLP-1 alongside several other pharma companies looking for that edge in the market.\n\nThe biotech expects topline data from an ongoing phase 2b study of MET-097i in mid-2025. Metsera also anticipates \u201cexploring\u201d additional trials of the drug candidate in participants with obesity and Type 2 diabetes this year.\n\nSkye Bioscience\n\nDrug candidate: nimacimab\n\nAnticipated data readout: Second quarter 2025\n\nSky Bioscience began a phase 2 trial last August for its cannabinoid receptor 1 inhibitor, nimacimab, as a weight loss therapy in obese patients. The drug candidate is a \u201cfirst-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody\u201d that blocks CB1 signaling, which can have anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and metabolic actions, according to Skye. The study will not only explore weight loss, but also assess lean mass retention and gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nThe injection is being studied on its own and in combination with Wegovy, Novo Nordisk\u2019s GLP-1 weight loss blockbuster.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly a need for alternative mechanisms of action that can provide physicians and patients with improved overall health outcomes in the pursuit of weight loss beyond those achieved with GLP-1 and GIP drugs,\u201d Punit Dhillon, Skye\u2019s CEO, said last year.\n\nNovo Nordisk is also exploring an oral cannabinoid receptor 1 inverse agonist, monlunabant, formerly INV-202. But the process has been rocky. The pharma giant picked up the drug when it acquired Inversago Pharmaceuticals in 2023, and a phase 2a study found that while all doses of monlunabant resulted in \u201cstatistically significant weight loss compared to placebo,\u201d there were some reported mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects,\u201d including anxiety, irritability and sleep disturbances. Novo is planning to initiate a phase 2b trial in 2025.\n\nSkye is also studying neuropsychiatric and cognitive effects in its study, expecting interim data from the trial in the second quarter of 2025 and final data by the end of year.\n\nEli Lilly\n\nDrug candidate: orforglipron\n\nData release: Third quarter 2025\n\nWhile Lilly is already a leader in the obesity market and taking on Novo in head-to-head trials of their GLP-1 injections, the pharma behemoth is also investigating an oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron. Novo also has its own oral option in the works, as does Pfizer, Roche and more. In fact, Novo already has an approved oral GLP-1 on the market for diabetes patients, Rybelsus. However, Lilly is in late-stage testing for an obesity indication of its daily oral pill.\n\nLilly entered phase 3 testing for orforglipron in late 2024, and a large study of 1,500 participants is scheduled to wrap in August 2025, with a readout likely soon after, according to Lilly\u2019s third quarter earnings. An oral option may have several benefits for users, including a lower price as more options flood the market. Getting to market early among those chasing oral GLP-1 approvals would further solidify Lilly\u2019s dominance in the booming space.",

Demand for the injection has soared over the last year despite its roughly $1,000 per month price tag before insurance.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said \"current Medicare Part D and Medicaid coverage rules apply\" to Zepbound following its landmark approval in December for the most common sleep-related breathing disorder.\n\nMedicare Part D plans can only cover obesity drugs if they are used for an additional medically accepted purpose approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the CMS spokesperson said, referring to the agency's guidance. The spokesperson added that Part D plans may consider using prior authorization \u2014 a process where a provider must first get approval from an insurer \u2014 for those drugs to ensure they are being used for that specific purpose.\n\nThe FDA on Dec. 20 cleared Zepbound for patients with obesity and moderate-to-severe forms of obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, which refers to breathing interrupted during sleep due to narrowed or blocked airways. That made Zepbound the first drug treatment cleared for the estimated 20 million people with those forms of the disease, according to Eli Lilly.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Eli Lilly called Medicare's coverage of Zepbound for the condition \"good news.\"\n\nMedicare Part D plans are similarly allowed to cover Novo Nordisk 's weight loss drug Wegovy for its other approved use: lowering cardiovascular risks. The diabetes counterparts of Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 Ozempic and Mounjaro, respectively \u2014 are covered by Medicare and most insurance plans.\n\nBoth Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are studying their weight loss medicines as treatments for fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea and more. To be covered, those drugs would need to return late-stage trial results and then be submitted for FDA approval for those uses.\n\nMeanwhile, state Medicaid coverage for Zepbound and other obesity medications depends on what condition they are prescribed for and whether their manufacturer has signed a certain Medicaid drug rebate agreement, according to the spokesperson.\n\nUnder that agreement with the secretary of Health and Human Services, manufacturers agree to provide rebates to states in exchange for Medicaid coverage of their drugs. States share the rebates with the federal government.\n\nA state Medicaid program must cover Zepbound if it is prescribed for OSA and Eli Lilly has signed the Medicaid drug rebate agreement, the spokesperson said.\n\nBut if Zepbound is prescribed for weight loss, state Medicaid programs are not required to cover it.\n\nThe Biden administration in November proposed a rule that would allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight loss drugs for patients with obesity. The rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables, but it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.\n\nIt is unclear if President-elect Donald Trump's administration will pursue the rule.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.47%) are two of the most valuable healthcare stocks in the world, largely due to their successful diabetes and weight loss medications. They are also big players in the burgeoning GLP-1 weight loss market, and investors are paying large premiums for these stocks based on their potential.\n\nBut what's intriguing is that the potential may be even bigger than what analysts and investors are expecting. And that's because there may be even greater benefits associated with maintaining a healthier weight than the ones that are known today. One study suggests that it may even help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nStudy shows that belly fat is linked to an increase risk of Alzheimer's\n\nThere are many illnesses and conditions which are associated with being obese, which is why it's paramount for many patients to maintain a healthy weight. But one particularly concerning illness which you may not have considered to be associated with weight gain is Alzheimer's. The disease robs people of their memories, and since it's a neurological issue, many people may not think that carrying a lot of weight could put them at risk for that disease, but a new study suggests that could indeed be the case.\n\nAccording to a recent study in the U.S., visceral fat, or belly fat, could put a person at risk of developing Alzheimer's later on in life. Beta amyloids and tau proteins are signs of Alzheimer's disease, and they could be appearing decades before a person is diagnosed with the illness, as their visceral fat increases. As people gain weight, the area of the brain associated with memory also appears to shrink. As the process can take years, it heightens the need for people to maintain a healthy weight throughout their life.\n\nDiet, exercise, and a GLP-1 drug?\n\nThe study didn't suggest taking GLP-1 drugs to help patients keep the weight off, but the conclusion was that reducing belly fat could be key in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's later on in life. Diet and exercise can be effective ways to maintain a healthy weight, but for people who struggle with that, taking a GLP-1 drug can be a key part of the long-term strategy as well.\n\nWeight loss drugs such as Zepbound (Eli Lilly) and Wegovy (Novo Nordisk) could be crucial treatment options for patients looking to keep their weight down. In studies, they have helped people lose more than 15% of their body weight. And as there are more reasons to take these drugs beyond just weight loss, such as helping to prevent Alzheimer's, there may be an increase in healthcare coverage for these treatments, making them more widely accessible.\n\nBut it's important to note that while a study can be promising, it may not necessarily lead to a new indication for a drug, and it could take a while before regulators approve these treatments for other uses.\n\nWhat does appear evident, however, is that there can be wide-ranging benefits to taking GLP-1 drugs beyond just losing weight. People can live healthier lives, and as health experts learn more about these drugs, they can become even more important to doctors and patients, leading to even more revenue growth for their respective businesses.\n\nShould you hold a GLP-1 stock in your portfolio?\n\nZepbound and Wegovy have the potential to generate tens of billions in revenue for their respective companies. And as these businesses continue to invest into weight loss treatments and broaden their portfolios, they can be in prime positions to benefit from this excitement surrounding GLP-1 drugs.\n\nIf you're investing in the long term, holding shares of Eli Lilly or Novo Nordisk can be a great idea given how much upside these stocks may possess simply due to their highly effective GLP-1 drugs. It wouldn't surprise me if within the next 10 years, both of these stocks rise to valuations beyond $1 trillion as they can be among the best healthcare investments to be hanging on to right now.",

            "content": "FOIAengine: How Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Others Use FOIA\n\nWelcome to 2025. At PoliScio Analytics, we logged 45,720 federal FOIA requests into our FOIAengine database during the past 12 months. But one subject, more than most others, dominated in hundreds of requests from hedge funds, pharmaceutical companies, and the news media: GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re taking a closer look at what some of those GLP-1 requesters wanted to know during the past year. We last covered the weight-loss revolution when it was just getting started. (See our May 3, 2023 story, \u201cRiding the Ozempic Wave.\u201d) Since then, there\u2019s been a surge in weight-loss FOIA requests, as seen clearly in FOIAengine, which tracks FOIA requests in as close to real-time as their availability allows. It\u2019s a function not just of the off-the-chart demand for the GLP-1 drugs, but also the high-stakes economic, legal, and public-relations battles being waged by their makers, U.S.-based Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Denmark\u2019s Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO).\n\nLilly\u2019s GLP-1 products include Zepbound, Mounjaro, and Trulicity. Novo Nordisk\u2019s competing products include Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, and Saxenda. Their sudden appeal caused a roller-coaster run in the stock price of both companies. But the drugs\u2019 popularity came with a double edge. Lilly and Novo Nordisk were transformed into punching bags in Congress because of their discrepant pricing practices \u2013 the drugs are often far less expensive outside of the U.S. Ozempic can cost more than nine times in the U.S. what it does in Germany, where it retails for $59. Wegovy can be more than 4.5 times more expensive in the U.S. than it is in Denmark, where it is available for just $186.\n\nLast fall, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), then-chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Education, called in Novo Nordisk\u2019s CEO to testify about the price discrepancies, he titled the hearing, \u201cWhy Is Novo Nordisk Charging Americans with Diabetes and Obesity Outrageously High Prices for Ozempic and Wegovy?\u201d\n\nAnd both companies now are litigation targets, with at least 188 cases filed against Novo Nordisk and 108 cases against Lilly, according to Docket Alarm. In addition, the popular GLP-1 products made by both companies have been lumped into a sprawling consolidated federal multidistrict litigation case in Philadelphia. At last count, there were at least 1,331 additional plaintiffs in the MDL litigation \u2013 with plaintiffs lawyers trolling for more.\n\nFOIA requests to the federal government often are signals. They can be an important early warning of bad publicity, litigation to come, or uncertainties to be hedged and gamed out. When the flow of requests turns into a flood, it is most likely a sign of all three \u2013 take your pick.\n\nThe highlights below, illustrative of requests by, and about, Lilly and Novo Nordisk last year, illustrate the multiple uses of FOIA. All requests are from FOIAengine, as logged during the past 12 months.\n\nFOIA as competitive intelligence: Lilly filed far more FOIA requests with the Food and Drug Administration than its competitor, Novo Nordisk. And on occasion, Lilly\u2019s requests sought information about its chief competitor, a common occurrence in the world of competitive intelligence.\n\nAmong the examples: After FDA inspectors listed eight problematic \u201cobservations\u201d at one of Novo Nordisk\u2019s Danish plants, Lilly took note of the unfavorable report and filed multiple requests with the FDA, the most recent on November 4, seeking more information. And last March, after the FDA approved a new use for Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy \u2013 this time, as a treatment to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in overweight adults with cardiovascular disease \u2013 Lilly was quick to file a FOIA request with the FDA for Wegovy\u2019s new-drug-application \u201creview package.\u201d In each case, the FDA didn\u2019t specify the requester\u2019s name, and also didn\u2019t indicate whether any documents were handed over.\n\nNovo Nordisk didn\u2019t make any requests about its competitor, Lilly, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company wasn\u2019t watching. Third-party requests about both companies were prevalent, and any of those could have been made on behalf of any of the Big Pharma players.\n\nFOIA as a precursor (or supplement) to litigation: Not surprisingly, given the burst in litigation against Lilly and Novo Nordisk, there were numerous law firm FOIA requests about both companies. Among the examples: Last July, Baker & Hostetler sought \u201call electronic communications that the FDA (including, but not limited to, FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has received from Novo Nordisk, (or any person acting on its behalf), Eli Lilly (or any person acting on its behalf), or Julie Dohm from July 1, 2022 to July 15, 2024 involving compounding of semaglutide or tirzepatide.\u201d\n\nThe request about \u201ccompounding\u201d was noteworthy. Dohm is a partner at Covington & Burling, which represents Novo Nordisk. Before joining Covington in 2019, she was the FDA official responsible for regulating compounding pharmacies. The FDA log didn\u2019t indicate Baker & Hostetler\u2019s interest. But compounders, including wellness centers and medical spas, have been fighting to continue selling off-brand versions of the GLP-1 products \u2013 because, they argue, Lilly and Novo Nordisk are unable to keep up with demand. Whether the compounders can keep doing that is also a matter of ongoing litigation.\n\nFOIA as an indication of (often negative) publicity to come: An average of one in every five of the hundreds of requests about Lilly or Novo Nordisk came from the news media. Such requests ran the gamut. Reuters sought every problematic FDA inspection of Lilly\u2019s manufacturing facilities covering the first three months of 2024. The New York Times made a detailed request for, among other things, \u201call correspondence \u2013 including reports, emails, or memoranda \u2013 between FDA agency staff and Eli Lilly personnel regarding its [Alzheimer\u2019s] drug, donanemab, that contain any of the following case-insensitive key-words: brain atrophy, or brain shrinkage, or brain volume\u201d \u2013 a rare media request targeting Lilly that wasn\u2019t about GLP-1 drugs. Two months ago, on the heels of an earlier Lilly request, Reuters also sought full details about the FDA\u2019s problematic inspection of Nono Nordisk\u2019s Danish plant.\n\nLast October 31, Bloomberg, which accounted for the most media requests about the two companies, sought \u201cdisclosure of the following records: correspondence between employees of or representatives (attorneys, lobbyists, etc.) of Eli Lilly and the FDA Commissioner, or anyone else working in the Immediate Office of the Commissioner office, on the topic of the shortage of tirzepatide injection, dated between January 1, 2024 and the date this request is processed. I am requesting the entirety of the correspondence, including any attachments (including email attachments), exhibits, addendums, appendices, and anything else like that.\u201d Other media requesters about Lilly and Novo Nordisk during the past year included Stat News, CNBC, CNN, and the Capitol Forum.\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019ll be watching, and reporting, as FOIA requests continue to roll in.\n\nFOIAengine access now is available for all professional members of Investigative Reporters and Editors, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of journalism.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nPrivately-held biotechnology startup Metsera said Tuesday a long-acting GLP-1 shot it\u2019s developing helped people who are overweight or have obesity lose more weight than placebo recipients in a Phase 2 trial.\n\nStudy participants who received the shot, dubbed MET-097i, lost on average 11% more of their body weight than those who got a placebo over the course of 12 weeks. Placebo-adjusted weight loss also reached around 20% in those who received the highest dose, comparable to what was observed in tests of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy over a similar period.\n\nMetsera also said data from the trial support plans to test MET-097i as a monthly injection, less frequent than the weekly shots Zepbound and Wegovy require. The announcement is the latest step forward for a company that has raised more than half a billion dollars since launching last April to support a bid to challenge Lilly and Novo\u2019s medicines.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSo-called incretins have quickly become some of the most sought-after medicines in drug research. The drugs can help people not only shed a significant amount of body weight, but avert heart problems and, potentially, treat other associated conditions. Some Wall Street analysts believe the medicines could top $100 billion in yearly sales next decade.\n\nYet the currently available drugs are flawed. People have to get weekly shots of Zepbound or Wegovy over the long term to cut weight, and keep receiving treatment to maintain those benefits. But the prospect of frequent injections, as well as gastrointestinal side effects, can make multiple years of therapy a tough proposition. Recent analyses of medical records suggest that half of those taking the drugs for obesity alone have stopped treatment after a year, and even more \u2014 as many as 85% \u2014 after two years.\n\nAs a result, several drugmakers are working on ways to improve upon Wegovy and Zepbound, either by developing oral formulations, longer-lasting medicines or targeting different biological pathways.\n\nMetsera is doing all of the above with a portfolio of prospects it acquired through deals. Its most advanced is MET-097i, an attempt to reduce the number of injections people would have to receive. The company says the drug has a half-life \u2014 a potential marker of durability \u2014 of 15 to 16 days, compared with about one week for Wegovy and five days for Zepbound.\n\nThe Phase 2 trial reported Tuesday enrolled 120 people who are overweight or have obesity and divided them into five groups of 24, with four people in each cohort receiving a placebo. In four of the study groups, trial volunteers randomized to receive MET-097i got fixed doses of between 0.6 and 1.2 milligrams for 12 weeks. The fifth group received a dose that increased from 0.4 to 1.2 milligrams over the course of 12 weeks.\n\nIn the 13th week, all participants receiving MET-097i received a double or quadruple dose to assess the side effects of a potential monthly shot.\n\nMetsera said drug exposure quadrupled over the four weeks in the people who received the fixed doses. In those whose dose level gradually increased, only one mild case of nausea and two instances of vomiting were reported, all of which were transient in nature. Though cross-trial comparisons can be misleading, those results are favorable to what was seen in testing of Zepbound and Wegovy.\n\n\u201cThese data suggest that MET-097i has the potential to be a foundational therapy for people with obesity and overweight, by virtue of its effectiveness, compelling tolerability profile and flexible options for dosing,\u201d said John Buse, director of the University of North Carolina diabetes center, in a statement from Metsera.\n\nAccording to Metsera, another Phase 2 trial has enrolled all of the planned 239 volunteers and is expected to produce data in mid-2025.",

Patients are desperate for affordable access, compounding pharmacies see a market opportunity, and brand manufacturers insist that compounding of their patented drugs infringes on their intellectual property and endangers public health. While the FDA itself has voiced concerns about compounded versions of FDA-approved GLP-1 therapies , the agency is allowing a grace period before taking enforcement action against state-licensed pharmacists/physicians compounding under section 503A (60 days) and outsourcing facilities under section 503B (90 days).\n\nIn a declaratory order issued December 19, 2024, the FDA determined that tirzepatide products (Mounjaro and Zepbound) were no longer in short supply. This move, contested in Outsourcing Facilities Ass\u2019n v. FDA, No. 4:24\u2010cv\u2010953 (N.D. Tex.), grants Eli Lilly a significant win in its effort to restrict compounding of its medications.\n\nThe FDA will not enforce FDCA provisions that typically prohibit compounding of \u201cessentially a copy\u201d of an approved drug until February 18, 2025, for 503A pharmacies and March 19, 2025, for 503B outsourcing facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, semaglutide remains on the FDA\u2019s shortage list for several dose strengths, though all doses have been reported as \u201cavailable\u201d since late October 2024.\n\nSafety concerns, patent and affordability issues collide\n\nThe FDA has warned about potentially substandard quality, unlabeled salt forms, and dosing errors in compounded versions. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk assert that widespread compounding poses safety concerns and undermines their intellectual property rights. Lilly has requested to join ongoing litigation and sent cease-and-desist letters to telehealth companies and medical spas selling compounded tirzepatide.\n\nCompounding pharmacies, especially larger 503B \u201coutsourcing facilities,\u201d maintain they provide an essential public service by offering lower-cost versions of medications that can cost over $1,000 per month. Many insurers still refuse to cover brand-name GLP-1 products for weight loss. Yet the FDA has reported hundreds of adverse event reports allegedly linked to compounded versions of these drugs, which do not undergo the same rigorous manufacturing inspections and clinical testing as approved brands.",

Moreover, governments and companies are making significant investments to develop drugs targeting unmet medical needs. With this backdrop in mind, using TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Eli Lilly (LLY), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) against each other to pick the healthcare stock with the highest upside potential, according to analysts.\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is focused on therapeutic areas like diabetes, oncology, immunology, and neurodegeneration. However, the company has been mainly gaining attention for its Type-2 diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss medication Zepbound.\n\nWhile Q3 results fell short of expectations and the company lowered its full-year adjusted profit guidance, the demand for these blockbuster drugs remains strong. Eli Lilly has been making significant investments to boost the production of these drugs.\n\nAside from meeting the robust demand for its glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist drugs, such as Mounjaro and Zepbound, the company is also focused on capturing opportunities across other therapeutic areas. Moreover, it is optimistic about approvals of these two drugs for other indications. Remarkably, Zepbound recently won the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) approval for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.\n\nIs Eli Lilly a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nRecently, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott reiterated a Buy rating on Eli Lilly stock with a price target of $1,100. Despite expectations of Eli Lilly arriving at the lower end of the Q4 2024 guidance, Schott is optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects in 2025 and beyond. He expects growth to be driven by higher sales from Mounjaro and Zepbound, fueled by increased supply, a rise in promotional activities, and broader label coverage for Zepbound.\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Eli Lilly stock based on 15 Buys and two Hold ratings. The average LLY stock price target of $1,050.79 implies 37.3% upside potential. Shares have risen 24% over the past year. LLY stock offers a dividend yield of 0.67%.\n\nSee more LLY analyst ratings\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nHealthcare company Abbott Laboratories has a diversified presence across diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. After facing a setback during the pandemic, the company\u2019s key division, Medical Devices, has been rebounding well and delivered about a 12% revenue growth in Q3 2024. It offset the weakness in the Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses.\n\nLooking ahead, Abbott is optimistic about its diversified business model and new products. Notably, it is upbeat about Lingo, a continuous glucose monitoring system available without a prescription, which was launched in the U.S. in September 2024.\n\nIs ABT a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nLast month, TD Cowen analyst Josh Jennings reiterated a Buy rating on ABT stock and increased the price target to $135 from $130. The analyst believes that there are multiple tailwinds that can help the company sustain continued growth in 2025. He added that the revised price target reflects a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of 23.5 times the 2026 EPS estimate of $5.75.\n\nThe analyst noted that at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference held in October 2024, Abbott reviewed its Structural Heart business and gave favorable information on the company\u2019s TriClip, Navitor, and Amulet offerings, which are all gaining market share in the domestic market. The analyst is optimistic that these products can supplement MitraClip\u2019s growth and help drive double-digit growth for the overall business.\n\nAmong the other growth drivers, Jennings highlighted the Libre franchise and the company\u2019s solid product pipeline. Jennings noted that the company is comfortable with Wall Street\u2019s 2025 sales and EPS growth estimates of 7% and 10%, respectively.\n\nWith 17 Buys and three Holds, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Abbott Laboratories stock. The average ABT stock price target of $134.06 implies about 19% upside potential. Shares have risen by only 2% over the past year. ABT stock offers a dividend yield of 1.95%.\n\nSee more ABT analyst ratings\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)\n\nIntuitive Surgical is a dominant player in the minimally invasive and robotic-assisted surgery space. The company is mainly known for its da Vinci Surgical System. ISRG shares have rallied 68% over the past year, thanks to the increased adoption of the company\u2019s da Vinci systems. As of the end of Q3 2024, the da Vinci surgical system\u2019s installed base expanded by 15% year-over-year to 9,539 systems.\n\nIt is worth noting that a substantial portion of the company\u2019s revenue is recurring in nature and includes instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. Specifically, recurring revenue accounted for 86% of ISRG\u2019s total revenue in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter results on January 23, 2025. The analyst expects the company\u2019s adjusted EPS to increase by more than 9% to $1.75 in Q4 2024 and revenue to rise 14.3% to $2.20 billion. ISRG has exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates for seven consecutive quarters.\n\nIs Intuitive Surgical a Good Investment?\n\nIn a research note on the MedTech sector\u2019s prospects in 2025, Bank of America (BofA) stated that Intuitive Surgical and Boston Scientific (BSX) remain its top picks for the third consecutive year. Analysts at Bank of America noted that both these companies delivered solid EPS growth in 2024. While the two companies might lack similar tailwinds for valuation growth in 2025 compared to last year, their consistent top-line growth and EPS upside might continue to make them attractive.\n\nSpecifically, BofA analysts view Intuitive Surgical as a leader in surgical robotics, with its da Vinci system well-positioned for further growth through technological advancements and broader geographic adoption.\n\nOverall, ISRG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and four Hold recommendations. At $570, the average ISRG stock price target implies 5.1% upside potential.\n\nSee more ISRG analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is optimistic about the long-term prospects of Eli Lilly, Abbott Laboratories, and Intuitive Surgical. However, analysts see higher upside potential in Eli Lilly compared to the other two healthcare stocks. Analysts are optimistic about Eli Lilly due to the substantial demand for its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, and opportunities across other key therapeutic areas.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Peptide drugs, such as the metabolic medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound from Eli Lilly, must be administered as injections. But the biotech industry has been pursuing ways to make peptides into pills, and the oral peptide research of startup Orbis Medicines now has Lilly as a financial backer.\n\nLilly is one of the investors in Orbis\u2019s \u20ac90 million (about $93.4 million) Series A round announced Monday. The preclinical startup has not yet disclosed specific diseases for its drug research. But the Copenhagen-based company says it is focusing on targets that are already validated by blockbuster biologic drugs administered by injection.\n\nPeptides are chains of amino acids. One reason peptides aren\u2019t well suited for oral delivery is that they don\u2019t hold up well in the gut\u2019s digestive environment. Macrocycles, peptides formed into a circular shape, can be made into drugs formulated for oral dosing.\n\nMacrocyclic drugs are already available. One of the best-known examples is cyclosporine, a immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant. The macrocyclic drug candidates of Bicycle Therapeutics resemble two wheels, a more stable shape it says facilitates the ability to bind to targets and address targets that can\u2019t be drugged by small molecules. Christian Heinis, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is a scientific co-founder of both Bicycle and Orbis. Morten Graugaard D\u00f8ssing, who was executive chairman of Orbis\u2019s board of directors, told MedCity News last year that Bicycles\u2019 drugs are still relatively large in size, which poses challenges for oral dosing. Orbis\u2019s macrocycles, which it calls nCycles, can be formulated for oral dosing and offer the ability to address targets inside and outside of a cell.\n\n\u201cThey are smaller, cell permeable, and we can make them at scale,\u201d Graugaard D\u00f8ssing said of nCycles. \u201cWe see us as being very different from other companies in this space.\u201d\n\nOrbis\u2019s nCycles come from nGen, a technology platform that the company says can synthesize and analyze up to 100,000 distinct synthetic macrocycles in weeks, work that would take months or even years with conventional drug discovery methods. The startup was founded in 2021 by Novo Holdings, based on Heinis\u2019s research.\n\nThe new financing for Orbis comes nearly a year after the young company emerged from stealth, revealing \u20ac26 million (about $28 million) in seed funding. The latest round of financing was led by New Enterprise Associates. Besides Lilly, other new investors in Oribis include Cormorant, the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark. Founding investors Novo Holdings and Forbion also participated in the financing.\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nAlong with the financing, Orbis announced the appointment of Graugaard D\u00f8ssing as its new CEO. He had served as executive chair of Orbis\u2019s board for the past three years.\n\nPhoto: Martin Barraud, Getty Images",

            "content": "To boost production of medicines that can help people with conditions including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer and diabetes, Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) is investing heavily in an area key to its success: its research and advanced manufacturing facilities. Since 2020, the Indianapolis-based company has committed more than $20 billion to build, expand and acquire manufacturing sites in the United States and Europe. The most recent example is its $4.5 billion investment in the Lilly Medicine Foundry, an advanced manufacturing and drug development facility that will also support research and development.\n\nExpected to open in late 2027 in Lebanon, Indiana, the Foundry will allow Lilly to research new ways to produce medicines and scale up manufacturing of medicines for clinical trials. For example, the Foundry will be able to explore new technologies, which could include green chemistry and biocatalysis as well as continuous processing, all integrated with advanced manufacturing capabilities such as process modeling and process analytical technologies, according to Sarah O\u2019Keeffe, senior vice president\u2014product research and development at Lilly.\n\nSarah O\u2019Keeffe, Senior Vice President\u2014Product Research and Development, Lilly / Eli Lilly and Company\n\nO\u2019Keeffe told BioSpace this capability will make it easier for the company to experiment with how it makes medicines. She explained that Lilly often relies on external partners for its clinical supply, and it\u2019s not always easy for them to try, for example, new equipment sets or process analytical technologies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had these ambitions to make medicines in different ways, in ways that will improve quality, will improve the throughput and, ultimately, speed to market,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe said. \u201cThis facility provides more control in what we can do in terms of that innovation as well as being able to reliably supply material to the clinic.\u201d\n\nBecause the pharma will be able to try new technologies at the Foundry and, ideally, transfer learnings to its other manufacturing facilities, the facility could serve as a critical milestone for the entire business.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of everything we do, it\u2019s about speed to patient,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe said. \u201cIn every corner of Lilly, we\u2019re all thinking about that\u2014whether it\u2019s trying to discover the next new medicine or whether you are working on a potential medicine that is in clinical trials\u2014how do we get these medicines to patients who are waiting?\u201d\n\nInvesting in Infrastructure to Support Growing a Pipeline\n\nWhile it\u2019s still in the design stage, the Foundry should occupy about 1.2 million square feet, according to O\u2019Keeffe. She said its flexible design will include hybrid suites that allow staff to move equipment in and out so they can research, develop and manufacture a variety of drug substances, including small molecules, bioconjugates and nucleic acids.\n\nOnce fully operational, the Foundry is expected to employ about 400 newly hired engineers, scientists and operations personnel. The company has already begun hiring for the facility, starting with the site leadership team, according to O\u2019Keeffe.\n\nThe Foundry will be located at the LEAP Research and Innovation District, which is already home to a Lilly manufacturing site that received its own financial boost earlier this year. In May, Lilly announced it\u2019s investing $5.3 billion in that facility to increase production of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in the type 2 diabetes medication Mounjaro and weight-loss drug Zepbound, which are in high demand.\n\nAdditional manufacturing investments this year include a $1 billion expansion of Lilly\u2019s Limerick, Ireland, manufacturing site. Announced in September and already under construction, it\u2019s intended to increase production of biologic active ingredients for the company\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio and other medicines. The Alzheimer\u2019s portfolio includes Kisunla, which the FDA approved in July to treat adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn another September milestone, Lilly debuted its $800 million facility expansion in Kinsale, Ireland, which began making medicines last year to meet demand for Lilly\u2019s latest diabetes and obesity treatments, including Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nR&D Investment Targets RNA- and DNA-Based Therapies\n\nIn addition to growing its manufacturing capabilities this year, Lilly has also boosted research and development efforts in keeping with its commitment to R&D. O\u2019Keeffe noted the pharma invests a quarter of its revenue in R&D, exceeding the industry benchmark. According to a 2024 survey by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, its member companies spent slightly less, investing 21.4% of their total sales in research and development.\n\nIn August, Lilly opened the Lilly Seaport Innovation Center, an R&D facility in the Boston Seaport dedicated to advancing the pharma\u2019s work on RNA- and DNA-based therapies. The company is also using the site to create medicines that target diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration and chronic pain.\n\nThe Lilly Seaport Innovation Center not only houses scientists and researchers but can also accommodate staff from Lilly Gateway Labs, an innovation hub the company uses to connect earlier-stage biotechs with its platforms and expertise.\n\nCompany\u2019s Growth, Philosophy Let Employees Make a Difference\n\nO\u2019Keeffe said it\u2019s an exciting time to be at Lilly, which BioSpace recently named as one of its 2025 Best Places to Work. She noted the company has a rich and diverse pipeline in terms of therapeutic modalities, and employees can work on hard problems and develop new solutions to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not science for science\u2019s sake,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe said. \u201cIt\u2019s science with purpose, transforming molecules into next generation medicines that change lives.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Keeffe has a long history of making a difference at Lilly, where she began her career 17 years ago as a postdoctoral scientist. She vividly recalls a pivotal moment from her early days as a process chemist, when she looked into a 2000 L reactor and observed the first process she had ever developed. This was a drug substance manufacturing process, carefully designed to be executed by an operations team in a good manufacturing practice setting. For O\u2019Keeffe, designing, testing and going back to the drawing board on that process when something didn\u2019t work was nerve-wracking but thrilling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hard work, but it\u2019s so rewarding knowing that you had a hand in designing medicine that may make it into the hands of your family or friends someday,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a wonderful privilege.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Lilly, visit the website.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stock picks.\n\nIsrael Englander has always inspired the investment world by founding and managing the second-most profitable hedge fund in history. The Brooklyn-born billionaire investor began his career on Wall Street in 1970. After gaining valuable experience in trading and investment management, he founded Millennium Management in 1989.\n\nMillennium Management has become one of the world\u2019s largest and most successful hedge funds, managing $210 billion in 13F securities as of Q3 2024. Innovative investment strategies and a focus on risk management are the tenets that have propelled the hedge fund to tremendous success. Since its inception, Englander\u2019s hedge fund has averaged 14% in annual returns, solidifying its position in the highly competitive hedge fund landscape. The hedge fund has also racked up over $56 billion in cumulative profits for investors since its inception.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds and 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025.\n\nMillennium Management had its best year in 2000, when the dot-com bust started, and the S&P 500 was down 10%. Thanks to its multi-strategy approach, it returned 35%, which consistently produces positive returns. As the CEO, Englander only had one down year, a 3% decline at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The impressive performance stems from the billionaire investor focusing on unique investment strategies emphasizing diversification and risk management. Likewise, Englander advocates for a multi-strategy approach that makes it easy to capitalize on various market opportunities.\n\nMillennium Management\u2019s diversification strategy was highlighted when they sold tech stocks to invest in an index fund, emphasizing long-term growth and risk mitigation. Israel Englander remains focused on expanding the firm and leveraging technology to stay competitive.\n\nIn 2023, Israel Englander topped Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers with $2.8 billion in net earnings. Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities last year but lagged behind Citadel\u2019s $8 billion in 2022. Bloomberg cited sources saying Millennium\u2019s struggles are due to Englander\u2019s tight control. Financial Times reported Millennium manages $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people, and has 17 offices. The fund returned 8.3% in 2023, 12.5% in 2022, 13.6% in 2021, and 25.9% in 2020.\n\nMillennium Management was one of the hedge funds that benefited from the overall stock market rally, with the S&P 500 gaining 24% in 2024 due to optimism around artificial intelligence and interest rate cuts. The hedge fund also benefited from its exposure to many of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks, which were behind much of the actions in 2024.\n\nAfter two straight years of annual gains, the focus in the equity markets is on stocks that can maintain the upward momentum in 2025. Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s top stock picks are well poised to benefit from a strong US economy. While the billionaire investor\u2019s portfolio consists of tech stocks, it also consists of investment plays in healthcare, industrials and materials sectors. With that, let\u2019s take a look at some of his top stock picks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe analyzed Millennium Management\u2019s portfolio to make a list of billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s top 10 stock picks heading into 2025. We then settled on Englander\u2019s top ten holdings and analyzed them to determine why they stand out in generating long-term value. We then ranked these companies in ascending order based on the hedge fund\u2019s stake value.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nMillennium Management\u2019s Stake Value: $877.27 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 106\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a healthcare company that discovers, develops, and markets human pharmaceuticals worldwide. It\u2019s been a strong winner over the past few years due to the strong demand for diabetes and weight loss drugs. The stock was up by about 26% in 2024, emerging as one of billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s top stock picks.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has experienced a remarkable surge, fueled by high demand for their medications, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Zepbound is approved to help obese or overweight adults with at least one weight-related condition lose weight. Mounjaro has also been approved to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes improve their blood glucose levels.\n\nWall Street is incredibly excited about the company\u2019s long-term prospects as it is working on a GLP-1 weight loss pill. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) anticipates having information to share on a late-stage trial for orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug that has shown promise by April 2025. The once-daily pill has already posted solid results in helping overweight or obese people lose up to 14.7% of their body weight over a 36-week period.\n\nIn addition to weight loss pills, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also boasts of a robust and diverse pipeline of drugs. It sells a number of lucrative drugs that are used to treat conditions like plaque psoriasis and cancer. The FDA also approved the company\u2019s eczema and Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatments this year.\n\nOverall LLY ranks 5th on our list of Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than the ones mentioned on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "While many of us were sleeping in or headed to brunch on New Year\u2019s Day, a handful of people were up at dawn to spread a health-focused message far and wide.\n\nIn Pasadena, California, a trio of advocates boarded a float.\n\nAmong the assembled were Dr. Anjay Rastogi, director of the CORE Kidney Program and professor and clinical chief of nephrology at the UCLA Health\u2019s David Geffen School of Medicine; Pro Football Hall of Famer Brian Dawkins as well as a patient advocate named Thelma.\n\nThe three had come together to underscore the importance of kidney disease testing on a float constructed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and Eli Lilly in collaboration with CORE Kidney for this year\u2019s Tournament of Roses Parade.\n\nThe ceremonial float marked the latest activation in the ongoing It Takes 2 campaign from BI and Lilly.\n\nWhile this was the first appearance for the drugmakers at the parade, CORE Kidney returned after its debut in 2024.\n\nRastogi says the initial activation came about after a patient\u2019s husband asked him why the organization didn\u2019t have a float at the annual spectacle.\n\n\u201cI thought that was an absurd idea; we\u2019re a small program,\u201d Rastogi says. \u201cThe Tournament of Roses, however, welcomed us with open arms and our sole purpose was to increase kidney health awareness.\u201d\n\nImage used with permission.\n\nThe cause is a critical one for the nation. Some 35 million American adults have kidney disease and yet less than 20% of those at risk receive blood and urine tests. Increasing testing rates, especially among underrepresented patient populations disproportionately impacted by the disease, is central to the mission of the It Takes 2 campaign.\n\nThe Rose Parade offered an opportunity to reach 800,000 spectators who come to see the event in person, as well as upwards of 70 million viewers around the world who watch it via broadcast or streaming.\n\nThe float \u2014 named \u201cIt\u2019s in Your Hands: It Takes 2\u201d \u2014 was constructed out of organic materials as is true of all the 38 other floats this year.\n\nAnalyzing symbolism\n\nAs with so many physical installations at the heart of medical marketing activations, the float also included some elaborate and complex symbolism.\n\nThe front of the float features a pair of cupped hands lifting a lotus out of the water while a hummingbird hovers overhead.\n\nDan Guinipero, VP, US CRM asset and marketing lead at Boehringer Ingelheim, explains that the hands serve as a powerful reminder of self-advocacy: your health is in your hands. Meanwhile, the lotus and hummingbird represent the resilience and strength required from those living with kidney disease.\n\nBehind the lotus, he notes, are a pair of trees resembling kidneys frame a doctor and patient duo, underscoring the power of partnership \u2014 you and your doctor \u2014 when it comes to kidney health.\n\nA bridge at the back of the float connects to a gazebo, which represents the journey of all those who champion kidney health as a community.\n\nRastogi adds that there was hidden symbolism intentionally incorporated into the float.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know the symbolism, you might just say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a beautiful float,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut it represents the journey of the patient and the purpose of the float was to say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re not alone.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the float\u2019s symbolism may have required some unpacking, the song that accompanied it as it traveled the parade route was familiar to the spectators in Pasadena. Blasting out of two oversized boom boxes on the float was an educational update of Rob Base\u2019s 1988 classic \u201cIt Takes Two.\u201d\n\nAs part of the larger campaign, the lyrics have been rewritten to share the message that when it comes to assuring kidney health, it takes two\u2014a physician and patient, as well as two tests, blood and urine.\n\nThelma, a patient advocate who rode on the float, reflects on the difference that those two tests could have had on her life.\n\nShe says she was 12-years-old when she first went to a doctor with concerns about swelling in her hands and feet. Thelma says she was dismissed by the physician and told to lose weight.\n\n\u201cThey never dug deeper, but if my mom had known about those two tests \u2014 the blood test and the urine test \u2014 and had asked for them for me, maybe it would have been different.\u201d\n\nA decade later she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease. If her kidney disease had been identified earlier, it\u2019s possible its progression could have been slowed.\n\nHaving seen the parade on television as a child, Thelma was excited to be part of the event and promote such a personal cause.\n\n\u201cIt was such a pleasure to meet Brian Dawkins in person and we were so excited to get the word out. Come on. It\u2019s a new year and a new you. Let\u2019s get your kidneys checked. It\u2019s in your hands, right?\u201d",

Credit: sanjeri via Getty Images.\n\nDenmark-based biotech Orbis Medicines has raised \u20ac90m ($94m) in a Series A funding round to advance the development of its next-generation orally dosable macrocycle drugs, which the company calls \u207fCycles.\n\nThe financing was led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) with participation from new investors, including Eli Lilly, Cormorant, and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark. The company \u2013 which launched in February 2024 with $28m (\u20ac26m) in seed funding from Novo Holdings and Forbion \u2013 is focused on creating oral alternatives to injectable biologics, particularly for chronic diseases, according to Orbis CEO Morten Graugaard.\n\nOrbis aims to address longstanding challenges in developing macrocycles \u2013 large ring-like compounds made from amino acids or other building blocks \u2013 into oral drugs. These compounds have strong therapeutic potential due to their ability to bind selectively to biological targets such as the immunosuppressant cyclosporine and the antibiotic erythromycin, but have historically faced issues with stability, absorption, and bioavailability.\n\nThe biotech\u2019s initial focus is on programmes against targets that are already validated by blockbuster biologic drugs to provide oral alternatives for patients who might prefer to take a pill rather than having treatments injected or by intravenous (IV) infusion.\n\nIn September 2024, Orbis announced a research collaboration with Vivtex to leverage its gastrointestinal robotic interface system (GI-ORIS), a platform designed to assess gut permeability, which is crucial for determining the oral bioavailability of Orbis\u2019 \u207fCycles portfolio. A month later, the company announced a significant expansion of its operations and capabilities by joining Symbion\u2019s new biotech startup hub in Fuglebakken, Copenhagen.\n\nThe macrocycle space is gaining some momentum across the pharmaceutical industry. MSD is in late-stage clinical development for macrocyclic peptide drug MK-0616 (enlicitide decanoate) targeting PCSK9 in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The candidate, which is currently being investigated in several Phase III studies, is forecast to generate $1.5bn by 2030 if approved, according to GlobalData.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nMSD further displayed its interest in the space by entering a $220m deal with Unnatural Products (UNP), an AI-based biotech developing macrocyclic candidates. Competitors such as Circle Pharma have also made progress, raising $54m in a Series D round in July 2024 and signing a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in October.\n\n\u201cWe have a clear strategy for rapid value creation that leverages the unique capabilities of our \u207fGen platform and are excited to advance this important new class of drugs for patients,\u201d said Graugaard in the announcement accompanying the funding.",

            "content": "is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nIf you\u2019re health-conscious, chances are your feed for the past year has been flooded with influencers evangelizing hormone balancing as a hack for easy weight loss, lowering stress levels, and even reversing symptoms of hormonal conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). So it\u2019s not at all surprising to see Eli Health announce Hormometer, an at-home hormone-testing system that uses your spit and your smartphone\u2019s camera to measure hormone levels.\n\nLike many at-home tests, Hormometer requires you to take a sample of bodily fluid. In this case, it\u2019s saliva. It consists of a thin cartridge that you stick in your mouth for 60 seconds. It looks similar to a pregnancy test, with a window where you can view results. Once collected, the Eli app uses your phone\u2019s camera to assess the test\u2019s results based on criteria like color intensity and sample patterns. Depending on the test and results, Eli Health says the app will then provide personalized trends and recommendations related to stress, sleep, athletic performance, and fertility.\n\nTo start, Eli Health says it\u2019s offering two types of hormone tests: cortisol and progesterone. Cortisol is commonly known as the stress hormone and plays a critical role in regulating fight or flight response, blood pressure, blood sugar, metabolism, and sleep cycles. Long-term imbalances, both high and low, are often linked with negative health outcomes including Cushing\u2019s syndrome, unintentional weight gain / loss, fatigue, Type 2 diabetes, and abnormal blood pressure. Meanwhile, progesterone is a reproductive hormone. Abnormal levels can result in irregular periods, fertility problems, and depression.\n\nThe tests don\u2019t require you to mail in samples. You can just use your phone to get results. Image: Eli Health\n\nEli Health\u2019s tests are a reflection of recent health and wellness trends. Connected at-home testing kits, for example, saw a rise in popularity at the height of the covid-19 pandemic. Though expensive, smart over-the-counter PCR tests like Cue Health became a major part of some tech companies\u2019 return-to-office plans, thanks to their convenience and accuracy.\n\nSimilarly, a big part of Hormometer\u2019s appeal is its portability and accessibility. Traditionally, hormone tests have to be sent to a lab and are often taken at a doctor\u2019s office. That can take several days or weeks. They can also be messy if they\u2019re urine-based or invasive if blood-based. The advantage of this type of test is it doesn\u2019t require another party and can turn around results more quickly. As far as cost, Eli Health says Hormometer will come with a subscription plan, starting at $8 monthly with a 12-month commitment. That\u2019s competitive with other at-home hormone tests, which can range from roughly $30 to $250 and require people to mail in samples.\n\nMeanwhile, balancing hormone levels, particularly cortisol, has become a viral wellness trend. Tips to fix \u201ccortisol face,\u201d for example, ran rampant on TikTok throughout 2024. However, experts have decried hormone balancing as both misleading and potentially harmful \u2014 hormones can\u2019t truly be balanced, as they\u2019re dynamic and naturally ebb and flow throughout the day. That said, these tests could help people with official diagnoses of chronic hormonal or reproductive health issues monitor their conditions.\n\nA lot of that will depend on accuracy. According to Eli Health, the Hormometer is FDA registered. To be clear, this is different than clearance or approval. It doesn\u2019t mean the FDA has reviewed or cosigned Eli Health\u2019s claims. That said, the company claims that its cortisol and progesterone tests had a 97 percent and 94 percent agreement with gold-standard, FDA-approved lab tests in third-party testing, respectively.\n\nEli Health says Hormometer will begin beta access this month in the US and Canada. A full release is expected later this year. And while Hormometer is currently limited to cortisol and progesterone, the company says it\u2019s already developing testosterone and estradiol tests for the future.",

However, the NHS drugs watchdog NICE say it could take 12 years for everyone to receive it.\n\nPrivately, one month's supply costs around \u00a3180.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nHow effective it is: Trials pivotal to getting Novo Nordisk's semaglutide approved show it can help users shed up to 15 per cent of their body weight over 68 weeks.\n\nStudies have found Mounjaro, made by US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, could help obese people lose up to 22.5 per cent of their body weight in 72 weeks.\n\nSide effects, however, can include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting \u2014 which usually goes away over time \u2014 and constipation.\n\nResearch also suggests that, in rare cases, GLP-1 drugs can trigger pancreatitis, a potentially fatal swelling of the pancreas gland.\n\nRoughly one in every 1,000 patients on Ozempic or Wegovy, which both contain the same active ingredient, semaglutide, will develop the condition.\n\nIn trials of Mounjaro, around 23 out of every 1,000 patients developed pancreatitis.\n\nIn September, Scottish nurse Susan McGowan, 58, died from multiple organ failure, septic shock and pancreatitis after taking just two doses of Mounjaro.\n\nExperts say it will be important to monitor patients for these rare side effects, but argue that all medicines have complications.\n\nWeightWatchers pushes well-balanced meals full of protein, fruits, vegetables and nutrients, but the company is adamant that no food is off-limits\n\nWeightWatchers\n\nHow it works: Over five decades, WeightWatchers has built its global success on the premise that healthy controlled eating and iron willpower are the key to achieving sustainable weight loss.\n\nIt offers membership plans that offer support and recipes to help slimmers lose weight, giving members points budgets to stick to.\n\nOne programme is even designed specifically for people using appetite curbing injections.\n\nUsers input what they're eating into an app, which takes the food's calories and nutritional information to turn it into a WeightWatchers point value.\n\nCost: Under a 10-month subscription plan, users pay \u00a310 for the first 10 months, then a standard monthly price of \u00a318.95.\n\nThis plan includes a nutrition plan, trackers, and over 4,000 recipes for meal inspiration.\n\nHow effective it is: WeightWatchers pushes well-balanced meals full of protein, fruits, vegetables and nutrients, but the company is adamant that no food is off-limits.\n\nOne 2017 study published in The Lancet found participants on the programme lost an average of 4.75kg after 12 weeks and 6.76kg after a year.\n\nHowever, experts have previously warned that the low point scores promoted by WeightWatchers with certain foods don't always equal high nutritional value.\n\nOthers have cautioned that weight loss through calorie-restricted diets is not often sustained.\n\nThe ZOE diet, created by renowned expert Professor Tim Spector and team, helps people feel and sleep better, too\n\nZOE issues advice based on the user\u2019s \u2018unique biology\u2019 and promises to improve long-term health through a series of small, smart dietary changes\n\nZOE\n\nHow it works: The personalised regime is based on results of poo and blood samples.\n\nNo food is 'off limits' under ZOE's programme, which instructs users not to worry about calorie counting. Instead, it aims to create sustainable eating habits.\n\nTypically, users are recommended to shun large amounts of dairy, processed carbs and alcohol.\n\nThey are advised to tuck into fermented and high fibre foods, including oily fish, wholegrains, nuts, seeds and pulses.\n\nCost: The at-home test kit costs \u00a3299 for slimmers to take poo and blood samples.\n\nThese are sent to a lab to calculate blood fat, blood sugar, and gut microbiome levels before personalised food scores are created.\n\nEach food is given a 0 to 100 rating, based on how their body processes it, where 0 is positively damaging and 100 the best it can be.\n\nThe app, which charges between \u00a325 to \u00a335 per month, depending on the type of membership selected, then offers users personalised diet and lifestyle advice.\n\nHow effective it is: Studies suggest the 'anti-diet' has helped wannabe slimmers lose more than two inches off their waist in just 18 weeks.\n\nThe diet, created by renowned expert Professor Tim Spector and team, helps people feel and sleep better, too.\n\nAccording to research published in the journal Nature Medicine last year, as well as losing 6.3cm off their waist, participants who stuck to the ZOE strategy shredded 4.7 per cent of their weight (4.78lbs or 2.17kg), on average.\n\nHowever, ZOE app users have complained that the strict timings and rules around what you eat and when you initially take the blood tests can be complicated.\n\nOthers love it and have credited it with solving their weight issues. But some have also said that while they began well they did eventually relapse into old patterns.\n\nSlimFast has formulated a routine for those who love to eat little and often. With a simple daily routine combining conventional foods and diet products, the company promises results through a variety of different programmes\n\nSlimFast\n\nHow it works: Breakfast and lunch are replaced with SlimFast shakes or bars.\n\nA conventional cooked meal for dinner is allowed. But this should not exceed 600 calories for women and 800 calories for men.\n\nThree snacks are also allowed each day of up to 300 calories combined.\n\nCost: Roughly \u00a33.50 per day excluding dinner\n\nHow effective it is: Eating six times a day while on a diet isn't the most common tactic used to lose weight.\n\nBut SlimFast has formulated a routine for those who love to eat little and often.\n\nWith a simple daily routine combining conventional foods and diet products, the company promises results through a variety of different programmes.\n\nIncluding the normal meal for dinner, this averages dieters daily intake to an unforgiving 1,300 calories.\n\nUnder the plan, three snacks are also allowed each day of up to 300 calories combined\n\nFor those who struggle with their energy levels, SlimFast also offers a keto version of their programme.\n\nAdvocates say keto diets encourage ketosis, which is a metabolic state that occurs when your body burns fat for energy instead of glucose.\n\nBut experts have long warned that while SlimFast may provide an easy short-term solution, it is not always the best long-term investment.\n\nOne study found that those in the SlimFast group had lost an average of 10.5 pounds (4.8 kg), or 4.9 per cent of their body weight, after 6 months.\n\nHowever, almost a third (29 per cent) of participants dropped out of the study because they couldn\u2019t tolerate the diet, and only 9 of the original 58 participants were able to maintain the diet for 12 months at follow-up.\n\nOther experts have previously warned that strict keto diets could could trigger low blood pressure, kidney stones, constipation and nutrient deficiencies.\n\nParticipants are given a low-calorie, nutrient-complete soup and shake diet, totalling around 800 calories per day, for between 12 and 20 weeks\n\nThe Cambridge Weight Plan\n\nHow it works: The Cambridge diet \u2013 which has been rebranded as the 1:1 diet \u2013 remains one of the most restrictive diets out there.\n\nParticipants are given a low-calorie, nutrient-complete soup and shake diet, totalling around 800 calories per day, for between 12 and 20 weeks.\n\nThey also get support from a nurse or dietitian to reintroduce healthy foods and maintain weight loss, while medications for type 2 diabetes and blood pressure are stopped if deemed safe.\n\nCost: It is offered on the NHS or through a private consultant.\n\nSince its launch in 2020, roughly 25,000 people have been offered the NHS soup and shake programme, with the number expected to double in the next five years.\n\nAdults who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the last six years and have a BMI of over 27 are eligible for the programme.\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Weight Plan, the cost per week for the diet is around \u00a362.79 based on 3 meals a day.\n\nAlmost 4.3 million people were living with diabetes in 2021/22. And another 850,000 people have diabetes and are completely unaware of it\n\nHow effective it is: Soup and shake schemes have long drawn criticism from experts for being unsustainable.\n\nHowever, The Cambridge Weight Plan approach offered on the NHS was last year hailed as 'life-changing'.\n\nThe first analysis of the NHS's implementation of the soup and shake diet last year, found that a third of type 2 diabetes patients who followed the diet for a year lost weight and were in remission.\n\nHowever, only 12 per cent of those who embarked on the brutal diet managed to stick to it for a full year.\n\nIt means that, in total, only 3 per cent of patients who tried the diet actually achieved the desired result.\n\nOf the 945 people went on to complete the diet for a year, on average they lost 15.9kg.\n\nThe NHS said very low calories diets, that involve eating 800 calories per day or fewer, should only be followed under medical supervision and for a maximum of 12 weeks.",

            "content": "No one knows for sure what the new year will hold for the market. However, some stocks' chances for success look particularly good.\n\nWe asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick healthcare stocks they think could be big winners in 2025. Here's why they chose Amgen (AMGN 0.04%), Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%), and Summit Therapeutics (SMMT -3.62%).\n\nAmgen is a mispriced stock with a ton of upside\n\nDavid Jagielski (Amgen): Shares of Amgen started crashing in late November following the release of data from a phase 2 clinical trial for its weight loss candidate, MariTide. I think that plunge set the stock up for some serious gains in 2025.\n\nWhen I read that the stock price was falling because Amgen's monthly injection only helped people lose an average of 20% of their body weight after 52 weeks -- as opposed to the 25% that analysts were expecting -- I thought it was truly indicative of how speculative the markets have become. Seemingly everything has been reduced to whether something beats expectations, whether it's an earnings result or data from a clinical trial. Forget the fact that the data didn't indicate that participants' weight loss had plateaued (suggesting further weight loss could be attainable over longer periods of use), or that some patients took MariTide even less frequently than once a month. No, the market's whole response gets reduced down to whether the treatment candidate met expectations. It didn't, so let the selling begin.\n\nBut for those who want to buy the stock, and who see the results for what they are -- a clear indication that MariTide is a promising treatment that could be a more attractive alternative to weekly injections from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) -- the sell-off is great news.\n\nWhen the markets overreact like this, it creates a chance for investors to jump in and get a stock at a discount. Such opportunities may not last for long. I think that as cooler heads prevail and investors realize the study's results really weren't that bad at all, Amgen's stock will more than recoup the losses it has incurred in recent weeks.\n\nThis top healthcare company trades at 13 times forward earnings. It has a diverse portfolio of products, yields 3.6% at the current share price, and has a GLP-1/GIPR combination treatment in the works that could offer serious competition to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. I think Amgen is hands down one of the best healthcare stocks to buy right now.\n\nMultiple catalysts on the horizon\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): Despite a recent pullback, Eli Lilly's shares are up by 32% over the past year. And in 2025, the company could turn in yet another excellent performance, as it generally has over the past decade. Several catalysts could jolt the drugmaker's stock price this year.\n\nFirst, tirzepatide, which it markets as Zepbound and Mounjaro, could earn label expansions, including for reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nThere will also be clinical readouts for the medicine as it is being tested for other conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, an area with a high unmet need. Positive results could help Eli Lilly's shares move in the right direction.\n\nSecond, the company has other exciting pipeline programs, some of which will make progress next year. Eli Lilly's work in the weight loss area looks particularly exciting. Its late-stage pipeline features retatrutide and orforglipron, two potential weight loss treatments, and it has many others in the early stages of development. Good news on the R&D front could be a major catalyst for Eli Lilly's share price.\n\nLastly, the pharmaceutical giant's financial results should remain strong. Besides the fact that Zepbound and Mounjaro will continue to grow their sales rapidly, and that its other established medicines are still performing well, newer products could start making an impact. That's especially the case for Kisunla, a therapy for Alzheimer's that earned regulatory approval in July. With all that going Eli Lilly's way, the stock could once again deliver market-beating returns in 2025.\n\nHowever, regardless of what happens in the next 12 months, Eli Lilly is an excellent stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nPoised for another explosive year\n\nKeith Speights (Summit Therapeutics): Shares of Summit Therapeutics skyrocketed by 583% in 2024. The main catalyst behind this staggering gain was great news from a phase 3 study of ivonescimab in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, that clinical trial was conducted by Summit's partner, Chinese drugmaker Akeso.\n\nI think Summit Therapeutics is poised for another explosive year, and there's one simple reason behind my optimism: It should report results from its own late-stage study near mid-year. Granted, this trial is evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for NSCLC instead of as a first-line treatment, which was the case in the Akeso study. But if the results look good, it could set the stage for Summit to advance toward the regulatory approval of its first product.\n\nWhile Akeso's study didn't directly benefit Summit, investors understood its significance for the Florida-based drugmaker. Ivonescimab beat Merck's blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda in a head-to-head study -- something that had never happened before. The stellar results from Akeso's late-stage study bode well for Summit's study.\n\nSummit isn't staking all of its fortunes on ivonescimab in the second-line setting for NSCLC, either. The company has a phase 3 study underway of the drug in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for NSCLC. It also plans to initiate another late-stage study early this year of ivonescimab as a monotherapy in the first-line setting.\n\nEven without a product on the market yet, Summit's market cap stands at around $13.5 billion. If the candidate's late-stage results are positive (and I think they will be), this up-and-coming drugmaker could quickly grow much larger.",

This development, reported by the Bio-Economy Research Center of the Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization on Jan. 4, highlights the ongoing advancements in the pharmaceutical industry, despite a slight decrease from the previous year's 55 approvals.\n\nThe FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) granted these approvals, which encompassed a diverse range of small molecule drugs, biological products, and oligonucleotides. Notably, the number of new drug approvals last year surpassed the average annual number of 46.5 over the past decade, indicating a robust year for pharmaceutical innovation.\n\nAmong the notable approvals, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' \"Resmetirom\" became the first approved treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a metabolic disorder previously lacking any approved therapies. Additionally, the first schizophrenia treatments, \"Xanomeline\" and \"Trospium,\" developed by Karuna and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), received the green light from the FDA.\n\nEli Lilly and Roche led the pack with two new drug approvals each, the highest among companies. Cancer drugs dominated the list with 15 approvals, accounting for 30% of the total. Skin and blood disorders each saw six new drug approvals (12%), while heart disease treatments received five approvals, ranking third. In contrast, neurological and infectious diseases had fewer new drug approvals compared to the average over the past five years.\n\nBy modality, small molecule drugs had the most approvals with 32, followed by biological drugs (16) and oligonucleotides (2). The small molecule drugs included 30 non-peptide small molecule drugs, one peptide small molecule drug, and one radiopharmaceutical. The biological drug approvals comprised 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), three bispecific antibodies, two fusion proteins, and one toxin product.\n\nAmong domestic pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Hugel received approval for the botulinum toxin \"Letybo,\" and Yuhan Corporation received approval for the non-small cell lung cancer treatment \"Lazertinib.\" Lazertinib's approval is particularly noteworthy as it marks the first Korean cancer drug to receive FDA approval.\n\nThe Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization expressed optimism about the future, stating, \"We hope that this year will also see new drugs developed by domestic companies receiving approval from the U.S. FDA, which could help turn around the currently stagnant domestic investment atmosphere and invigorate companies' research and development (R&D).\"\n\nThe inclusion of South Korean companies Hugel and Yuhan Corporation in the list of FDA-approved drugs underscores the increasing role of international players in the global pharmaceutical market. South Korea has been investing heavily in its pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, aiming to become a global leader in drug development. The approval of drugs from South Korean companies by the FDA is a significant milestone and reflects the country's progress in this field.",

AstraZeneca's shares are down by 2% over the trailing-12-month period, while Novo Nordisk's shares are in the red by 14%.\n\nIt just so happens that these drugmakers have encountered issues in recent months that sank their stock prices, although there is a good chance they will recover and still deliver strong returns to patient investors. But which one is likely to perform better than the other? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Novo Nordisk\n\nNovo Nordisk has been making breakthroughs in diabetes care for about 100 years. The company is still at it. As of August 2024, it had a 33.9% share of the diabetes care market, up from the 33.3% it held a year before. Novo Nordisk also boasted a 55.6% share of the GLP-1 drug space, compared to 54.4% as of August 2023. The company's most famous brands, Wegovy and Ozempic, are both GLP-1s. They have helped Novo Nordisk's financial results grow rapidly in recent years.\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNVO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nThe weight loss market is projected to grow rapidly through the end of the decade. Few (if any) companies have a more attractive pipeline in this field than Novo Nordisk. True, one of the drugmaker's leading candidates, CagriSema, recently failed to impress investors in a phase 3 study. Upon closer inspection, though, Novo Nordisk's \"disappointing\" late-stage results for CagriSema weren't bad at all.\n\nIn fact, it could be the most effective weight loss treatment yet since it performed better than Wegovy in the trial against which it went head-to-head. CagriSema's 22.7% average weight loss by the end of the 68-week study was also better than what Eli Lilly's Zepbound accomplished in a similar trial. The market reacted the way it did because Novo Nordisk's management had promised a 25% average weight loss, but this miss means little to Novo Nordisk's long-term prospects.\n\nFurther, the company has several exciting candidates in other areas, including rare diseases and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. So, despite its recent dip, Novo Nordisk remains an excellent pharmaceutical stock to buy and hold.\n\nThe case for AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca's strategy is different from Novo Nordisk's. Whereas the latter derives most of its revenue from a few diabetes or obesity drugs, AstraZeneca has a large and diversified pipeline of medicines. The company's products span the field of oncology -- its most important and lucrative -- rare diseases; cardiovascular, renal, and metabolism; respiratory and immunology; and vaccine and immune therapies.",

In some U.S. states physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists , clinical psychologists , and other medical professionals are permitted to write prescriptions in addition to doctors . Prescription drugs are generally divided into two categories: brand-name drugs and generic drugs . [2] [3]\n\nWith 79% of Americans saying prescription drug costs are \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and 70% reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority, the popular debate over prescription drugs is not whether drug costs should be reduced but how they should be reduced. One consideration is whether the U.S. federal government should regulate prescription drug prices. [1]\n\nAlthough there is speculation about how drug companies price drugs\u2014including consideration of competing drugs, medical uniqueness, and the overall market\u2014drug companies are not required to reveal how or why a drug is priced as it is, why or when a drug price may be raised, or why drug costs sometimes exceed research and development (R&D) expenses for the drug. [4] [8]\n\nIn 2020 total global drug company revenue totaled more than $1.27 trillion, which included revenue from the manufacturers\u2019 sale of drugs and other products (such as shampoo and baby products). Drug sales accounted for about $904 billion in revenue. Johnson & Johnson had $82.6 billion in total 2020 revenue, the highest for any drug company worldwide, $45.5 billion of which was from drug sales. Roche followed at a distant second, with $62.05 billion in total 2020 revenue, $49.5 of which was from drug sales. Global drug revenue is expected to continue to rise. [5] [6] [7]\n\nIn the United States, drug companies (also called pharmaceutical companies ) set prescription drug prices, which are largely unregulated by the federal government. Some drug companies will be familiar because their names have been attached to COVID-19 vaccines or other common products\u2014Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer , for example. Others may not be household names but command large portions of the market nonetheless: Swiss companies Roche and Novartis , to name two. [4]\n\nAccording to the Rand Corporation , prescription drug prices in the United States were 2.56 times higher on average than prices in 32 other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, with brand-name drugs coming in at 3.44 times higher. While generic drugs in the U.S. cost slightly less than the global average and accounted for 84% of drugs sold, they made up only 12% of total drug spending in the United States. Total drug spending in the countries included in the study was estimated to be $795 billion, and the U.S. accounted for 58% of sales and 24% of volume. [11]\n\nThe cost to the patient is determined by three agents. The first is the drug company, which sets a price for a drug it has developed or purchased from another company. The second is pharmacy benefit managers, who negotiate rebates and savings on behalf of health insurance companies, Medicare Part D drug plans, large employers, and other groups. (These agreements, however, are generally not publicly disclosed, so actual cost savings to patients are unknown). The third agent is health insurance companies, which determine which drugs will be approved for their customers\u2019 use, how much the insurance company will pay for the drugs, and how much patients will pay. Patients may not know their out-of-pocket cost for a drug until standing in line at the pharmacy, and, because of disparate insurance coverage, one patient may pay more than another for the same drug. [8] [9] [10]\n\nThe second was a bill passed by the House on Mar. 31, 2022, that would have limited the cost of insulin to $35 a month\u201425% of the insurance plan\u2019s negotiated price, whichever was lower\u2014but it too died in the Senate. [13] [14]\n\n\u201cAllow the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D\n\nTwo legislative efforts to reduce prescription drug prices came before the U.S. Senate , having passed the House of Representatives in 2021 and 2022. The first was a provision in the Build Back Better Act, passed by the House on Nov. 19, 2021, which died in the Senate in 2022. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the act would have done the following, among other things:\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Florida to import prescription drugs from Canada . The authorization was the first in the country but just the first step in the importation of prescription drugs to Florida . Canada has restrictions in place to prevent the export of drugs if doing so \u201cwill\u2026cause or exacerbate a drug shortage in Canada.\u201d The population of Florida is roughly half that of Canada, and Canada has had shortages of drugs, from cancer medications to weight-loss and diabetes medications, making export unlikely, according to experts. [44] [45] [46]\n\nSection 804 of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) \u201callows importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada to: significantly reduce the cost of these drugs to the American consumer, without imposing additional risk to public health and safety.\u201d [1] [2] [47]\n\nFor doctors to be able to meet their patients\u2019 needs, they must have accurate cost information. One way to ensure that they do is via congressional action to make costs transparent and drugs more affordable.\n\nRobert Popovian, a pharmaceutical economist, asked, \u201cWe know that the correct data exist, so why don\u2019t physicians have access to it when they are prescribing these medications?\u201d [10]\n\nAs Lipoff explained, \u201cDoctors must remember our responsibility to consider the whole patient, including his or her financial livelihood, and make a point of bringing up the cost of care with each of our patients. If patients with limited means spend more money on medications, that expense means less money for the rest of their budget, with real consequences. With better transparency and advocacy on behalf of our patients, we as physicians must strive for the most cost-effective care.\u201d [25]\n\nJules Lipoff, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, stated, \u201cPatients appreciate it when doctors have a well-thought-out backup plan (for example, an over-the-counter or other prescription alternative) and bring up costs during an office visit. Patients do not like being told reflexively to call if there\u2019s an issue filling the medication at the pharmacy\u2014that puts the responsibility on them to figure out a complicated system.\u201d [25]\n\nWithout prescription drug cost information, doctors are left to guess. In a survey of 371 primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and rheumatologists who were given insurance information for a hypothetical patient, only 20% correctly determined the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for a drug that costs $1,000 per month. [10]\n\nAmong physicians, 74% believe considering patients\u2019 medical benefits is important when choosing which drug to prescribe. And 59% want to be able to compare drug costs at the point of prescription. However, 29% of physicians do not trust the information they have access to about prescription drug costs. Additionally, 59% reported that knowledge of their patients\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug costs is \u201chigh-priority,\u201d but only 11% have easy access to that information. [24]\n\nDoctors frequently do not know, and may not have access to, prescription drug costs for their patients. Because patients have a variety of insurance policies with varying prescription drug coverage, doctors are left to prescribe drugs without knowing whether the patients will be able to afford the drug at the pharmacy. [18]\n\nMillionaire Martin Shkreli was dubbed the \u201cmost hated man in America\u201d for raising the price of Daraprim, an AIDS drug, from $13.50 a pill to $750. And other drugs have seen similar increases. Why did drug companies raise the costs of these drugs? As journalist Emily Willingham stated, \u201cbecause they could.\u201d Life-sustaining and life-saving medications should not be subject to the whims of corporations and millionaires. [20] [22] [23]\n\nEpiPen, a life-saving drug for patients who experience severe allergic reactions, such as to bee stings or certain foods, contains about $1 worth of epinephrine and cost about $57 in 2007. The price jumped 400% when the drug company Mylan acquired the drug that same year, raising the cost to $500 or more. Even an insured patient could pay upward of $400. Raising the price allowed the drug to account for 40% of Mylan\u2019s operating profits in 2015. [19] [20] [21]\n\nDrug prices are first set by drug companies, which have an interest in recouping R&D costs and raising corporate revenues. Drug costs are then negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers, which are private companies interested in profit. Pharmacy benefit managers keep a portion of rebates, which are negotiated without public disclosure, and some health insurance companies have reported seeing none of the rebates. Then consumer drug prices are set by insurance companies, which also want to increase their bottom lines. Without government regulation, drug prices can be increased by the drug companies, rebates can be withheld by the pharmacy benefit managers, and insurance companies can refuse to cover a drug, leaving patients with few options. [8] [9] [18]\n\nAs explained by Truth in Rx, an American Medical Association campaign for drug price transparency, \u201cPrescription drug price increases can lead some patients to not be able to afford critical medicine\u2026.The result? Among this group, three in ten say their condition got worse.\u201d [18]\n\nBecause of high drug costs, 29% of adults surveyed in the Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they did not take their medication or medications as prescribed, 19% did not fill a prescription, 18% took an over-the-counter (OTC) drug instead, and 12% cut pills in half or skipped doses. Similar results were found among respondents to a Healio Internal Medicine poll. [15] [17]\n\nTori Marsh, director of research at GoodRx, explained some of the consequences of having to buy expensive prescription drugs: \u201cIn 2020, 20.7% of people reported taking on debt or declaring bankruptcy due to the cost of their prescription medications. Borrowing from friends or family was the most common financial action (16.8%), followed by getting loans (5.0%), taking out another mortgage (1.2%), and filing for bankruptcy (1.0%).\u201d [16]\n\nSome 24% of people taking prescription drugs in the U.S. reported difficulty affording the drugs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Moreover, 58% of people whose drugs cost more than $100 a month, 49% of people in fair or poor health, 35% of those with annual incomes of less than $40,000, and 35% of those taking four or more drugs monthly all reported affordability issues. Additionally, 30% of people aged 50 to 64 reported cost issues because they generally take more drugs than younger people but are not old enough to qualify for Medicare drug benefits. [15]\n\n\u2014Ezekiel Emanuel, \u201cOpinion: Why We Can Have Both Innovative Drugs and Lower Drug Prices,\u201d politico.com , Oct. 13, 2021\n\nI\u2019m an oncologist who has seen his patients reap huge benefits from the kind of high-priced innovation drug companies love to talk about. I\u2019m also a health-policy specialist who has looked carefully at the long-term impact of drug company prices and profits. I\u2019m convinced that we don\u2019t have to choose between reasonable prices and innovation. The truth is, if Congress passes legislation to give Medicare negotiating power to make drugs more affordable, we will still have robust innovation.\u201d\n\nExcessively high prescription drug prices are a substantial financial burden on Americans,\u2026but they also raise insurance premiums and taxes for you and me by increasing costs for insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. Society will pay the other $200,000 through those higher premiums and taxes\u2026.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the undisputed global leader in drug research and development, and pharmaceutical companies warn that imposing controls on drug prices\u2014like those currently being debated in Congress\u2014will stifle that innovation. But many Americans, including the well insured, cannot afford the innovative drugs produced by that research\u2026.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and the chair of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, stated,\n\nThe reason: Large pharmaceutical companies are nowhere near as important to real drug innovation as they purport to be. Furthermore, smart policy changes can sustain and increase the pace of life-changing breakthroughs in biomedicine through increased funding of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cutting the costs and accelerating the speed of clinical trials, and reforming patent law to stop innovation-blocking abuses used by Big Pharma to prevent new drugs from entering the market.\u201d\n\nThis is a false choice. We need not trade the certainty of saved lives now for the possibility of saved lives in the future.\n\n\u201cLegislation giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices in the United States would make their life-saving potential immediately available to millions of Americans who cannot now afford them, thus extending lives and alleviating suffering. The pharmaceutical industry, however, has done a masterful job of arguing that these Americans must suffer in the short term since lower prices would gut long-term innovation in drug development.\n\nDavid Blumenthal, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, Mark E. Miller, an executive vice president of health care for Arnold Ventures, and Lovisa Gustafsson, a vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, stated,\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this from people across the country who have serious illnesses and can\u2019t afford their medicine. What a painstaking position to be in. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cFixing prescription drug pricing has consistently been a top issue for Americans year-after-year, including the vast majority of both Democrats and Republicans who want to see a change because they simply cannot afford their medications.\n\n\u2014Nicole Rapfogel and Thomas Waldrop, \u201cCongress Can Act Now to Lower Drug Costs by Allowing Medicare to Negotiate Prices,\u201d americanprogress.org , Feb. 1, 2022\n\nSenators have the power to meaningfully lower prices for some of the nation\u2019s most expensive drugs\u2014drugs that treat cancer, prevent blood clots, and treat autoimmune disorders. Passing drug price negotiations and other key drug reforms is a critical step toward lowering drug costs for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nCongress has the opportunity to pass drug pricing legislation that would be life-changing for millions of older adults. More than 4 in 5 seniors think drug costs are unreasonable. Senators should take the overwhelmingly popular step of enabling the federal government to negotiate prices. Lowering drug prices through negotiation, inflationary rebates, and insulin and cost-sharing caps would allow people\u2014especially those with chronic conditions and disabilities\u2014to access the treatment they need.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of prescription drugs is a major concern for many Americans. Nearly 9 in 10 older adults take prescription medication, yet high drug prices are leading to soaring out-of-pocket costs, dangerous drug rationing, and a depletion of limited financial resources\u2014especially for those with fixed incomes\u2026.In particular, the drug pricing provisions\u2026would enable the federal government to finally negotiate drug prices\u2014a policy supported by more than 80 percent of the public\u2026.\n\nAllowing Americans to use the global free market without more government interference is the most effective way to force American drug companies to lower prices.\n\nA 2019 Vice investigation found that patients were crossing the border into Mexico to buy Novolog insulin pens for $17 each because the cost in the United States jumped from $289 in 2013 to $540 in 2019. Other insulin prices also rose: Humalog went up from $35 in 2001 to $234 in 2015, and Lantus from $244 to $431. [36] [37] [38] [39]\n\nAmericans should be able to import drugs from Canada and Mexico. Drug companies lobbied to ban drug imports to prevent competition that would force American companies to reduce their prices. [36] [37] [38] [39]\n\nFurthermore, most Americans support allowing drug imports from Canada: 79% of Independents, 78% of Democrats, and 76% of Republicans. [15]\n\nOther free-market options include making more drugs available over the counter (OTC), such as birth control pills and statins, which are available OTC in other countries and would lower costs if available OTC in the United States, and deregulating the ban on marketing or sharing information about drugs in research with insurers and doctors, which would lower advertising costs after FDA approval. [35]\n\nTom Coburn, a late former U.S. senator (R-OK), explained, \u201cThe problem with drug prices\u2026is not that they start out expensive, but that they stay expensive for years after they have been on the market. The main culprit here is the regulatory environment that limits the creation of a free, functioning and competitive market for prescription drugs\u2026.Rather than doubling down on government regulation, we should rely on the free market, which is the best way to allocate these scarce resources, increase competition, lower prices and continue to foster medical innovation for years to come.\u201d [34]\n\nBecause of this requirement, patients should be able to find a drug, covered by insurance, that will treat most conditions. The cost debate is largely over relatively few name-brand drugs. [32] [33]\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies are required to cover at least one drug from every United States Pharmacopeia (USP) category and class. [32] [33]\n\nIf Congress were to expand affordable, quality insurance with appropriate prescription drug coverage, the drug cost problem could be alleviated, if not eliminated, while providing better health care for everyone. [27]\n\nThe study\u2019s authors emphasized that \u201cuninsured individuals were more likely to be in racial minority groups, amplifying pre-existing disparities in healthcare access,\u201d and people who were \u201cuninsured were younger, in poorer health, and\u2026had lower personal income compared with our overall sample.\u201d [30] [31]\n\nA 2021 study found that while drug companies offered rebates to health insurance companies, those rebates did not translate into lower out-of-pocket drug costs for customers. The rebates were tied to higher costs for consumers per prescription drug: $6 for those with commercial insurance, $13 for those with Medicare, and $39 for people without insurance. [30] [31]\n\n\u201cPolicy makers,\u201d suggests Ricks, \u201cneed to focus on fixing broken health [insurance] plan designs that shift too much cost to the sick in order to lower premiums for the healthy.\u201d [29]\n\nHowever, Ricks stated, \u201cWhat the US system does poorly is sharing these negotiated savings with patients who use the medicines. In fact, patient costs for medicines are increasing even while net drug manufacturer prices are decreasing. This paradox exists because no matter how much of a discount an insurer or provider negotiates, most [insurance] plans don\u2019t pass the discount to patients.\u201d [29]\n\nDavid A. Ricks, CEO of drug company Eli Lilly, explained that drug companies negotiate lower prices for government programs including Medicare and for private insurance companies. [29]\n\nDrug companies spent about 25% of revenues on R&D in 2018 and 2019 and were outpaced in R&D spending only by the semiconductor (an electronic component) industry As Investopedia editors summarized, \u201cR&D is the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s lifeblood. The success of major drug companies almost wholly depends upon the discovery and development of new medicines.\u201d [28]\n\nFurthermore, R&D is attached to drug companies\u2019 long-term growth strategy, not only in terms of revenue but also in terms of copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Without R&D and new drugs, the companies could fail to produce the growth and revenue needed to keep older drugs on the market. [28]\n\nDrug companies can more reliably fund R&D for new drugs with revenue from drug sales than they could with venture capital or other outside investments. Studies have shown that cuts in drug companies\u2019 revenue result in drops in future research and the number of new drugs. [26] [27]\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported, \u201cIn 2019, the pharmaceutical industry spent $83 billion dollars on R&D. Adjusted for inflation, that amount is about 10 times what the industry spent per year in the 1980s. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of new drugs approved for sale increased by 60 percent compared with the previous decade, with a peak of 59 new drugs approved in 2018.\u201d [26]\n\nR&D of a new drug costs between almost $1 billion and more than $2 billion. Considering that only approximately 12% of drugs tested are approved by the FDA, the average R&D cost per approved drug is significantly higher (about $12.5 billion). [26]\n\nRemoving the ban would allow the drugmakers to provide easier to digest updates along the way, thereby reducing and spreading the costs of informing medical professionals over a longer period.\u201d\n\nThat ban forces drug companies to spend a lot of money to get the word out about new drugs once they do gain approval\u2026.\n\nThe drug industry would surely like a deregulatory push when it comes to the ban on drug companies sharing information about new drugs with insurers, hospitals and private practice doctors.\n\nOTC drugs also keep third-party insurance companies out the process entirely, also reducing costs and barriers to access.\n\nBirth control medication and most heart disease-fighting statins are over-the-counter drugs in most of the world\u2019s developed countries, but not the U.S. Even if making those drugs OTC doesn\u2019t immediately drop sticker prices, at least it reduces the costs connected with having to go to the doctor every time you need a prescription.\n\nThere are many other free market options that Big Pharma would probably support that would boost supplies of drugs and improve access to them. Chief among them is getting more drugs available over the counter.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to prescription drugs, I believe that reducing government intrusion, rather than increasing it, is the best way to get prices down and expand access to lifesaving treatments\u2026.\n\nThe most pressing needs for policy change are not federal price mandates but rather common-sense adjustments to Medicare Part D and commercial plans. If Congress focuses on capping annual drug spending for Medicare enrollees, ensuring low monthly cost sharing amounts that are predictable each month, and implementing cost-sharing based on what a health plan saved from drug company discounts\u2014millions of patients will see an immediate and dramatic reduction in what they pay at the pharmacy counter.\u201d\n\nWorse, government negotiation to set drug prices won\u2019t address the root cause of the problem America\u2019s seniors have when they buy medicine. Instead, policy makers need to focus on fixing broken health plan designs that shift too much cost to the sick in order to lower premiums for the healthy\u2026.\n\nUnder the guise of Medicare \u201cnegotiations,\u201d the US House of Representatives is considering a measure that would mandate the government to set prices on some of the most widely used drugs. These price controls would shrink the sector by 40 percent or $100 billion per year in revenue. Our entire industry invests about $100 billion per year in research and development.\n\nIf it all sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n\u201cCritics argue that the United States is the only developed country where the federal government doesn\u2019t negotiate prescription drug prices and that a 40 percent cut to the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s size will have limited or no impact on future cures or pandemic preparedness.\n\n\u2014Edmund F. Haislmaier, \u201cRx for Disaster: Democrats\u2019 Bill Shows How Not to Get Affordable, Innovative Prescription Drugs,\u201d heritage.org , Nov. 9, 2021\n\nRather than layering on more counterproductive government regulation, Congress should address government policies driving up prescription drug costs and making it harder to get drugs to market effectively.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the bill\u2019s approach would overturn a decades long bipartisan consensus that the government should create a climate for innovation and lower costs in prescription drugs\u2014without setting prices\u2026.\n\nSuch policies go in the wrong direction. They would hurt access to drugs and innovation, undermine the ability of private plans to negotiate further price discounts for enrollees, and discourage future generic drugs\u2014which often cost less\u2014from coming to market.\n\nSpecifically, in HR 5376 [the Build Back Better Act], the government would set prices in Medicare for a limited number of drugs that account for substantial spending in Medicare.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats have released their latest version of a drug-pricing proposal that would expand government\u2019s role by setting prices for prescription drugs for the first time.\n\nThe single best way to bring down prices is to increase supply and competition; policymakers should remove regulatory barriers to new therapies and follow-on products coming to market, while also working to ensure enforcement of laws targeting anticompetitive practices.\u201d\n\nLegislative changes to drug rebates, like those pursued through rulemaking under the Trump Administration, would ensure that patients with high drug costs receive meaningful assistance.\n\nChristopher Holt, the director of health care policy, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president, of the American Action Forum, stated,\n\n*Data from Switzerland and the United Kingdom were not available for 2004\u201309.\n\nAll costs below are in U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, the United States has maintained the highest costs of 12 OECD countries, increasing from $668.15 in 2004 to $1,126.27 in 2019. Sweden and the U.K. have maintained the lowest prices per person. [48]\n\nSweden covered the least amount of prescription drug costs with private insurance and government programs. And patients paid the least out-of-pocket in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile private insurance and government programs in the United States covered the highest amount of prescription drug costs of ten Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. also had the highest out-of-pocket costs for patients.\n\nFDA-Approved Prescription Drugs Later Pulled from the Market by the FDA\n\nAccording to the FDA, a \u201cdrug is removed from the market when its risks outweigh its benefits. A drug is usually taken off the market because of safety issues with the drug that cannot be corrected, such as when it is discovered that the drug can cause serious side effects that were not known at the time of approval.\u201d The FDA also takes into account the number of people taking a drug being considered for removal so as not to harm those patients.\n\nThe drugs below have been removed from the market by the FDA for various reasons, but the list should not be considered exhaustive. For more information, please consult the FDA\u2019s \u201cRecalls, Market Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts\u201d page or its X (formerly Twitter) account.

Anphar Labs (which developed the drug in France and sold rights to sell in the U.S. to SmithKline) sent a report to SmithKline in Apr. 1979 (translated in May 1979 into English from French) stating that Selacryn damaged livers. On Dec. 13, 1984, SmithKline Beckman plead guilty to \u201c14 counts of failing to file reports with the drug agency of adverse reactions to Selacryn and 20 counts of falsely labeling the drug with a statement that there was no known cause-and-effect relationship between Selacryn and liver damage.\u201d [51]\n\nSeldane (Terfenadine) Date of Approval: 1985 Date of Removal: Feb. 1, 1998 Manufacturer: Hoechst Marion Roussel Medical Use: antihistamine Cause for Recall: life-threatening heart problems when taken in combination with other drugs (specifically erthromycin (an antibiotic) and ketoconazole (an antifungal).

            "content": "Viking Therapeutics (VKTX 0.61%) didn't exactly capture investors' hearts in the final month of 2024. The biotech company's share price eroded by 24% in December, primarily on the back of a rival's aggressive move into a potentially very lucrative segment of the pharmaceutical market.\n\nIntensifying competition\n\nThat rival is a large and determined one: global pharmaceutical incumbent Merck (MRK 1.46%).\n\nIn mid-December, Merck announced it had entered into a licensing deal with China-based biotech Hansoh Pharma for that company's investigational weight-loss drug. If developed successfully, the drug, labeled HS-10535, would surely pose a serious threat to Viking's No. 1 pipeline program, VK2735. This, too, is an obesity drug; it has tested well in clinical trials and is relatively advanced in its development process.\n\nIt is also an orally administered treatment, giving it an advantage over competing products on the American market that are already Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the disorder. These are Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, both of which are delivered via injection.\n\nMerck's arrangement with Hansoh gives the former company exclusive global licensing rights to HS-10535, which is currently in development. Merck has already committed quite significantly to this, signing on to a $112 million up-front payment in the deal. The company has also agreed to pay its Chinese partner as much as $1.9 billion in milestone payments and royalties, assuming, of course, that the drug is ultimately brought to market.\n\nThe stakes are high in the weight-loss game. With only two GLP-1 drugs approved specifically for weight loss in the U.S., the market is still wide open. Meanwhile, such drugs are enjoying white-hot popularity in a country notable for its high rates of obesity. Americans love the idea of being able to jettison diet and exercise regimes in favor of simply taking a drug to shed pounds. So, demand is currently very strong and should remain so.\n\nA Viking shouldn't surrender\n\nWhile Viking investors are right to be concerned with Merck's move -- the company is large, powerful, and obviously has a plan -- I wouldn't be ready to throw in the towel just yet. HS-10535 still has some distance to go in its development cycle, and there's no telling how efficacious it'll ultimately prove to be.\n\nVK2735, then, seems like a better bet to make it to the hallowed commercialization stage. Given that it's an oral treatment rather than an injectible, it's sure to be a go-to treatment from the jump.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly filed a motion on Jan. 1 to join a lawsuit over whether copies of its GLP-1 drugs can be made by and sold by compounding pharmacies, arguing that it needs to take part in the case to defend its interests.\n\nThe Outsourcing Facilities Association, which represents sites that make compounded medicines, and the Texas-based compounding pharmacy FarmaKeio Custom Compounding filed the lawsuit in October. The plaintiffs are suing the FDA over the removal of tirzepatide, the GLP-1 drug Lilly sells as Mounjaro and Zepbound, from the agency\u2019s shortage list that month. While tirzepatide was on the shortage list, compounding pharmacies were able to legally make and sell the patent-protected drug in order to meet demand. In December, the FDA posted a declaratory order that confirmed the end of the shortage and gave compounding pharmacies 60 to 90 days to stop making tirzepatide.\n\nLilly\u2019s request to intervene, which was first reported by Reuters, argues that the lawsuit could affect its interests and that none of the existing parties adequately represents those interests. The FDA is the defendant in the case, but Lilly identified areas where its interests diverge from those of the agency.\n\n\u201cWhile Lilly has no doubt that FDA will defend its declaratory order, FDA has different interests than Lilly as FDA is a government agency tasked with administering the policy goals and objectives of the federal government, creating a reasonable possibility that FDA will not \u2018adequately represent [Lilly\u2019s] interest[s]\u2019,\u201d the drugmaker wrote in its legal filing.\n\nLilly is also concerned that the FDA may disagree with its interpretation of a section of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act about drug compounding. The company asserts that the law does not allow compounding pharmacies \u201cto manufacture copies of commercially available drug products\u2014and that conclusion does not turn in any way on whether tirzepatide is currently on the shortage list.\u201d\n\nThe law says state-licensed pharmacists can make \u201cessentially a copy\u201d of an FDA-approved medicine if the product is not \u201ccommercially available,\u201d Lilly said. Citing \u201clegislative history and statutory text,\u201d Lilly said that \u201ccommercial availability is not the same as a drug shortage,\u201d but the FDA may see things differently.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have alleged that FDA disagrees and has chosen to allow compounding pharmacies to mass-manufacture copies of commercially available drugs if they are on the shortage list,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cIf Plaintiffs are correct, no party in this litigation adequately represents Lilly\u2019s interest in seeing the appropriate application of section 503A for tirzepatide.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is advancing in parallel to regulatory actions. The FDA has given state-licensed pharmacists or physicians compounding under section 503A until Feb. 18 to stop making tirzepatide. Outsourcing facilities, which are covered by section 503B of the law, have until March 19 to stop production. The lawsuit represents a challenge to the FDA\u2019s power to remove therapies from the drug shortage list.",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Lilly falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLilly is expected to post earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +120.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.17 points to a change of +108.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.05 indicates a change of +82.6% from what Lilly is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lilly is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "In a market driven by innovation, it\u2019s counterintuitive to see a company with a less effective product outperform its competitors\u2014unless, of course, the answer lies in marketing.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy continue to outpace Eli Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound, even though the latter are demonstrably more effective in clinical trials. The most recent earnings reports highlight this stark contrast: Novo reported $2.54 billion in sales last quarter for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, significantly exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.21 billion. In contrast, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound fell short, generating $1.26 billion in sales compared to the $1.69 billion analysts had expected.\n\nLilly attributed its earnings miss to high manufacturing costs and fluctuating inventory levels amid surging demand for its anti-obesity treatments. But Novo faces similar challenges, and despite grappling with supply constraints and production capacity issues, it not only met but exceeded sales expectations. Novo\u2019s edge is clear: it has mastered the art of making its products unforgettable.\n\nAs marketing consultants at the New England Consulting Group, we have a deep history in the weight-loss space and advise clients in the consumer weight-loss category. We\u2019ve seen one truth emerge repeatedly over decades: the best product doesn\u2019t always win; rather, it\u2019s the best-marketed one that often dominates.\n\nMarketing Over Metrics\n\nOne critical factor shaping Novo\u2019s dominance is the interplay between DTC advertising and physician prescribing behavior. While prescribing decisions are rarely driven by advertising alone, DTC campaigns like \u201cOh, Oh, Oh, Ozempic!\u201d are designed to resonate with consumers, and they influence the conversations patients have with their healthcare providers. For instance, a patient who has seen Ozempic advertisements may request the drug by name. Since Ozempic is primarily indicated for diabetes, physicians often pivot to prescribing Wegovy\u2014which has the same active ingredient, semaglutide, and is approved for weight loss. In this way, DTC advertising can act as a catalyst for dialogue, introducing brand familiarity and sparking patient interest, while clinical judgment ultimately guides the final decision.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, Lilly should be leading the GLP-1 category. The company recently released results from the SURMOUNT-5 trial, which demonstrated that tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, outperforms Novo\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy. Patients on tirzepatide lost an average of 20.2% of their body weight after 72 weeks, compared to 13.7% on a semaglutide product.\n\nSimilarly, in diabetes, tirzepatide has shown superior efficacy in reducing A1C levels, a measure of average blood sugar over three months. In the Phase 3 SURPASS-2 study, Mounjaro reduced A1C by 2% to 2.3% across its doses, compared to a 1.9% reduction for semaglutide at its 1 mg dose. A subsequent meta-analysis further reinforced these findings, showing that all doses of tirzepatide lowered A1C more effectively than semaglutide, with the highest dose of tirzepatide reducing A1C by 2% compared to 1.62% for semaglutide at its highest dose.\n\nSome argue that Novo\u2019s success stems from being a first mover in the GLP-1 market. However, this overlooks the history of earlier GLP-1 receptor agonists like Byetta and Bydureon, which were approved in 2005 and 2012, respectively\u2014years before Novo introduced Ozempic. While these drugs were originally approved for diabetes management, they also demonstrated significant weight loss. Novo itself entered the weight management space in 2014 with Saxenda, a GLP-1 drug that led to an average loss of 9.2% of initial body weight. In other words, the success of Ozempic and Wegovy lies not in their timing but in Novo\u2019s ability to elevate these products through a sophisticated and consistent marketing strategy.\n\nConsider this: If you\u2019ve seen a pharmaceutical ad recently, chances are you can hum along to the chorus of \u201cOh, Oh, Oh, Ozempic!\u201d or recall the empowering imagery in the Wegovy \u201cDiscover the Power\u201d campaign, featuring a reimagined version of The Greatest Showman\u2019s \u201cThis Is Me.\u201d These ads don\u2019t just inform\u2014they create emotional connections that stick. With nearly two billion ad impressions in June 2024 alone and an estimated $42 million media spend for Wegovy\u2019s latest campaign, Novo\u2019s advertising strategy is built to dominate both attention and consumer mindshare.\n\nNovo\u2019s ads consistently celebrate personal transformation, embedding the brand into cultural conversations and making its products feel relatable and empowering. For many consumers, Novo\u2019s brands are synonymous with GLP-1s or with weight loss drugs more broadly, a testament to the power of marketing that connects emotionally with its audience.\n\nBy contrast, while Lilly has made strides with its advertising, such as its Oscars \u201cBig Night\u201d ad for Mounjaro addressing accessibility and stigma, these efforts have been more sporadic. Additionally, the Oscars campaign dissuaded a large percentage of potential users (\u201cvanity\u201d users as Lilly calls them) from using the drug, saying, \u201csome people have been using medicine never meant for them. For the smaller dress or tux, for a big night, for vanity.\u201d The impact of Lilly\u2019s messaging hasn\u2019t matched the cultural resonance of Novo\u2019s campaigns. As a result, names like Ozempic and Wegovy are far more entrenched in public consciousness than Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nStriking the Right Tone\n\nWhile marketing has been pivotal, Novo\u2019s success isn\u2019t just about storytelling\u2014it\u2019s about execution.\n\nConsider the \u201cShame\u201d ads that Lilly has run this year, tackling serious themes like the societal perceptions around weight loss. While well-intentioned, the ads were dark and somber, emphasizing challenges like stigma and the complex emotions tied to dieting. They highlighted everything consumers might dread about starting a weight loss journey, inadvertently creating a negative association with the brand.\n\nIn contrast, Novo\u2019s ads for Wegovy and Ozempic were upbeat, aspirational and rooted in personal transformation. With empowering music, relatable characters and an emphasis on hope, Novo painted a picture of possibility. The ads didn\u2019t dwell on the struggles of dieting; instead, they invited consumers to see the outcome: a healthier, more confident version of themselves.\n\nBoth Novo and Lilly created exceptionally effective drugs, but only Novo has managed to translate that into an inviting and memorable brand experience. Ads that resonate emotionally and inspire action are far more effective than those that unintentionally amplify the difficulties of the journey.\n\nFurthermore, Novo\u2019s proactive investment in manufacturing capacity ensured that it maintained trust with prescribers and patients. The company\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises\u2014both in product availability and brand consistency\u2014has further solidified its position in the market.\n\nLessons for the Industry\n\nThe Novo vs. Lilly dynamic highlights an essential truth: Marketing isn\u2019t merely a complement to innovation but a critical driver of commercial success. Companies that focus exclusively on clinical data risk being outperformed by competitors who know how to connect with consumers on a deeper level.\n\nLilly\u2019s position underscores the importance of consistent and pervasive marketing. While its products are demonstrably more effective, its messaging hasn\u2019t resonated as broadly. Even well-received campaigns, such as the Mounjaro Oscars ad, haven\u2019t been enough to close the gap left by Novo\u2019s relentless focus on cultural relevance and emotional storytelling. Novo\u2019s success is a case study in how strategic, memorable marketing\u2014paired with strong execution\u2014can elevate a brand above even clinically superior competitors.\n\nThe challenge is clear: Make sure your marketing is as effective as your product, or risk remaining in the shadows of a competitor with a catchier tune.",

The ruling applies to anyone importing illicit knockoff tirzepatide products.\n\nIn December, the FDA removed tirzepatide from the list of drugs subject to shortages, a regulatory status which makes it legal for compounding pharmacies to produce their own versions of a drug on a temporary basis.\n\nThat change in status has been challenged in the courts by groups representing compounding sector, including the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFAC) and FarmaKeio Custom Compounding, which claim that there are continued supply disruptions.\n\nLilly recently joined the FDA in defending its position in the lawsuit, hoping to block efforts by the compounders to continue making tirzepatide. As it stands, pharmacies and outsourcing facilities are required to wind down production by February 18 and March 19, respectively.\n\nLilly claims that the availability of compounded tirzepatide and other obesity therapies makes it harder for patients to make sure they are buying a legal version, as the market has been flooded with illicit copies.\n\n\"Most people have no idea that the knockoff compounded drugs they are taking may be coming from dangerous and illicit foreign sources,\" said Patrik Jonsson, president of Lilly USA.\n\n\"Knockoff medicines, or the active ingredients they contain, are often produced abroad in unregistered facilities that have never been inspected by any regulatory agency,\" he added.\n\n\"Sometimes these knockoff medicines \u2013 which come from places like China and India \u2013 are sold by entities that cannot even legally sell them in their own countries. Lilly has obtained illegal shipments from China claiming to be ''tirzepatide' that are deceptively packaged as dog food, tea, and facial masks or hidden inside of a box of t-shirts.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it points to evidence that compounded versions may also be unsafe. In November, the FDA alerted patients about tirzepatide products from a licensed California compounder that \"used non-sterile ingredients\" and \"took no steps to sterilise them.\"",

In the U.S., the numbers are even starker with 40% of American adults being considered obese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that a newer class of highly-effective weight-loss drugs, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin treatments have taken the country by storm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley (MS-2.11% ) project that the global market for these weight-loss drugs could reach $105 billion by 2030. In the U.S. alone, adoption is expected to grow to 31.5 million people \u2014 approximately 9% of the population \u2014 by 2035.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe growing use of these drugs could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for long-term healthcare outcomes and costs, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz in an interview. However, due to their high-price and lack of widespread insurance coverage, these medications remain inaccessible to many patients.\n\n\u201cObesity is a chronic disease with more than 200 downstream indications,\u201d Jonsson said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other chronic disease that is not covered in insurance plans outside of obesity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonsson began leading the company\u2019s most lucrative division this January. He now oversees Eli Lilly\u2019s pipeline of incretin medications, including its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound.\n\nZepbound belongs to the incretin class medications, which was made popular by Ozempic, Novo Nordisk\u2019s diabetes treatment. These drugs mimic hormones that reduce appetite and regulate blood sugar. Demand for these medications have transformed Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.25% ) and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, recent studies and clinical trials have found that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss, potentially paving the way for broader insurance coverage and thus wider-access.\n\nEarlier this year, Eli Lilly published results of a study that found that the drug behind Zepbound was found to help nearly eliminate the risk of diabetes for adults who are pre-diabetic and are overweight or obese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drug was tested on over 1,000 adults over the course of three years who had pre-diabetes and were overweight or obese.\n\nPatients who took weekly doses of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 94%, compared to patients who were on a placebo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean if we prevent diabetes or at a minimum delay the onset of action with three, five, ten years? The impact on humanity is significant,\u201d Jonsson said of the potential implications of the study.\n\nAdditionally, the company announced results of trials that showed the drug could help with other conditions like heart failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts competitor Novo Nordisk has also explored additional medical uses for its incretin medications, such as treating chronic kidney disease.\n\nJonsson said this growing bank of evidence \u201cunderscores the value of treating obesity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk\u2019s weight-loss drug Wegovy for reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. As a result, Medicare began covering the drug. Medicare is currently only allowed to cover these medications for weight loss if they are prescribed to treat a second condition as well.\n\nAnd in December, the FDA approved Zepbound as the first prescription drug to help alleviate moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for adults with obesity, opening the door for Medicare to cover the drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Joe Biden is now trying to expand access to pricey blockbuster drugs in his final months in office. The Biden-Harris administration proposed a new rule on in November that would expand coverage of the anti-obesity medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nThe proposal must still undergo the formal rule-making process, which could take several months, and would require endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump to be implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis complicates the issue since Trump has named Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as his choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nKennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country\u2019s obesity epidemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonsson rejected the notion that diet and exercise alone could solve the obesity crisis.\n\n\u201cIn all the clinical trials, not just for Lilly, but I think for most of our competitors as well, there is a placebo arm that includes diet and exercise,\u201d Jonsson said. \u201cSo, diet and exercise are regularly checked in placebo-controlled trials. And it\u2019s not sufficient. It\u2019s never even close to making a significant difference.\u201d",

Credit: Ciara Kimsey / Shutterstock.\n\nFollowing positive results from its SURMOUNT-5 trial, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (tirzepatide) will surpass Novo Nordisk\u2019s Weogvy (semaglutide) in the obesity treatment market, according to a GlobalData analyst.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nPointing to the results of Eli Lilly\u2019s recent SURMOUNT-5 trial (NCT05822830), pharma analyst Costanza Alciati commented; \u201cEli Lilly\u2019s drug is more potent, and perhaps negotiations with national health services will also make it more cost-effective than Wegovy. So, Zepbound is expected to take the lead in the obesity market if it hasn\u2019t already done so.\u201d\n\nBased on SURMOUNT-5 results released last month, Zepbound was more effective in promoting weight loss. The trial demonstrated that Wegovy caused an average weight loss of 13.7% body weight, compared to 20.2% weight loss in patients using Zepbound.\n\nAlciati added: \u201cFrom the start, Zepbound emerged as the primary new competitor of Wegovy, and it seems that Eli Lilly has followed in some way Novo Nordisk\u2019s strategy to increase [the] patient population through investigating the drug in multiple indications.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s semaglutide is also approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and those with cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for several additional indications such as chronic kidney disease.\n\n\u201cThe impact of Wegovy on the obesity market has been huge. key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData defined it as \u2018revolutionary\u2019. Now with Zepbound, the revolution continues,\u201d said Alciati.\n\nIndeed, Novo Nordisk\u2019s model is echoed by Eli Lilly\u2019s, and tirzepatide is currently being investigated for additional indications, including chronic kidney disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), as well as for patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Last month, it received FDA approval for treating obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\nRecord-high sales made by Novo Nordisk in the obesity treatment space have prompted a wave of investment in the sector over the last few years. According to GlobalData\u2019s Drugs Database, there are now more than 400 companies actively developing obesity drugs, from discovery to pre-registration candidates.\n\nThere is also significant demand in the area. GlobalData identified that obesity and overweight conditions were estimated to have caused a staggering $425.5bn in economic costs to businesses and employees in the US alone in 2023. It reported that, of the 158 million civilian employees on nonfarm payrolls, 30% (46.9 million) were classified as having obesity and 34% (53.8 million) had overweight in 2023.",

            "content": "Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been competing in the obesity market for the past year, making it an opportune time to review the benefits of the two most prominent obesity medications. According to leading data and analytics company GlobalData, Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound (tirzepatide) is poised to surpass Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy (semaglutide), despite expectations for continued sales growth for both drugs.\n\nNovo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy made a significant impact on the obesity market when it launched in 2021. Many key opinion leaders interviewed by GlobalData have highlighted its revolutionary effect. With an average weight loss of 14% of body weight in obese patients, Wegovy became the most effective obesity medication available, addressing a previously underserved market. Wegovy\u2019s success, coupled with the recognition of obesity as a chronic metabolic disease, spurred a wave of investment into obesity treatment. Currently, more than 400 companies are actively developing obesity treatments in phases of development ranging from discovery to clinical trials and preregistration, according to GlobalData\u2019s drug database.\n\nFollowing Wegovy\u2019s success, Eli Lilly introduced Zepbound after receiving US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in November 2023. Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro outside the US, quickly emerged as Wegovy\u2019s primary competitor. Tirzepatide\u2019s dual agonism mechanism allows for 20% average body weight loss in patients. Recent head-to-head trial results demonstrated the superior efficacy of Zepbound over Wegovy, leading to a decline in Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock value. Zepbound\u2019s market entry has reduced Novo Nordisk\u2019s patient share over the past year, although drug shortages have also been a significant factor.\n\nNovo Nordisk has sought to maintain its market position by securing additional approvals for Wegovy, including for cardiovascular risk factors. Semaglutide, which was initially approved for type 2 diabetes under the name Ozempic, has since gained approvals for obesity and other metabolic indications. Currently, semaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for four additional indications, including chronic kidney disease. Similarly, tirzepatide has been approved for type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro and for obesity under the name Zepbound (or Mounjaro in some regions). On 20 December, tirzepatide also received FDA approval for obstructive sleep apnea. Tirzepatide is being investigated for four additional indications, including cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Both companies are aiming to expand the patient populations benefiting from their blockbuster drugs, leading to projected sales growth over the next decade. Thus, Eli Lilly appears to be following a strategy similar to Novo Nordisk\u2019s to further increase patient populations and sales.\n\nAdditionally, Eli Lilly is negotiating with various national health services regarding the pricing and prescription of tirzepatide. If tirzepatide proves to also be a more cost-effective option for patients, it may surpass Novo Nordisk in the obesity treatment market.\n\nDespite the recent launch of tirzepatide in many countries, the results from the past year indicate that Eli Lilly currently offers the most competitive option in the obesity market. This development represents a significant, albeit anticipated, challenge for its competitor Novo Nordisk.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.\n\nHealthcare has been one of Jim Cramer\u2019s favorite topics lately. The tail end of the year has pushed a portion of the sector, namely healthcare benefit managers and pharmaceutical chains, into Wall Street\u2019s spotlight. Investors were particularly anxious after President-elect Trump\u2019s remarks during a press conference at Mar-e-Lago. At the event, he promised to take on the healthcare middleman due to the high costs that Americans were facing. Americans are \u201cpaying far too much. . . .much more than other countries\u201d for healthcare, shared Trump. He pointed at what he believes is the heart of the problem. According to Trump, \u201cWe have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don\u2019t do anything except they\u2019re a middleman.\u201d\n\nThe role played by the healthcare middlemen has also made the President-elect vow to \u201cknock out the middle man\u201d despite understanding that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to be very unpopular after that.\u201d Cramer has spent several shows discussing either the broader impact of the President-elect\u2019s goal on the benefits management industry or the impact on specific companies. After Trump shared his plans for the middlemen, Cramer pointed out that the industry does enjoy significant reach.\n\nHe shared \u201cI think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress.\u201d This is because Cramer believes that once the different levers of the US government (Republicans, Democrats, and the Executive) act in unison then, \u201cwhen you have that kind of come together over them, you don\u2019t wanna be in that business.\u201d\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the big companies are not completely vulnerable. \u201cThese companies are not, uh, without their friends,\u201d shared Cramer. He also added that the firms also \u201cresent the middlemen. Cardinal\u2019s had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. [MCK] is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product.\u201d\n\nYet, while the companies might have friends, some of them are vulnerable as well. Later during his show, Cramer commented on the firm that ranks 13th on this list. He shared that this firm is \u201cviewed as being part of the problem of the cost of healthcare,\u201d and added that \u201cthey have no friends.\u201d He also mentioned another firm in a later program. This stock ranks 6th on our list of stocks Cramer talked about after the Fed\u2019s interest rate cut.\n\nHe believes that \u201cLook I think that if I were the people at [the healthcare benefit managers], when the President-elect decides that he is going to take a shot at you, as we know from his first time around, it\u2019s not one off. There\u2019s multiple shots. Multiple attempts to say listen you guys are . . . friction. I would not buy these stocks.\u201d Commenting on President-elect Trump and his partner Elon Musk, Cramer commented \u201cI mean these guys are powerful one-two combination.\u201d\n\nThe rather sharp remarks for the pharma benefits manager were somewhat of a departure from Cramer\u2019s earlier comments. For the same stock, he shared \u201cCan we just say that the middlemen have been under fire for decades. And they are always, they always, McKesson is always standing. McKesson has just defied everyone. Right. They defy everybody. No one can touch McKesson.\u201d\n\nOverall though Cramer believes that the healthcare benefits management sector might be in for trouble in the future. Investors also appear to be cognizant of this reality with some stocks down 45.57% year-to-date. Within this turmoil, let\u2019s see how his previous stock predictions have fared.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about healthcare stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out pharma, hospital management, and healthcare benefit management stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 106\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 8-20-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: -18.28%\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) has been the star of the pharmaceutical industry over the past year or so due to its weight loss drugs. However, with the weight loss drug industry now facing entry of low-cost options, the stock has been under pressure. Year-to-date, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s shares are up by 31% but they have lost 15% over the past six months. Within the six-month performance, two dips are particularly notable. One of these saw the stock drop by 14% in the first week of November after Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound sales of $3.11 billion and $1.26 billion in Q3 fell short of analyst estimates of $4.20 billion and $1.69 billion. Here\u2019s what Cramer said in August:\n\n\u201cEli Lilly (LLY) has announced that its novel weight loss and diabetes drug can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 94%\u2014and that\u2019s not in the general population but among pre-diabetic adults who are already prone to it. Add this drug\u2019s ability to aid in weight loss, and we\u2019re likely moving toward a future where people are less concerned about diet and exercise. After all, what they\u2019re doing now isn\u2019t working as well as Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide. \u201cPeople often lack the discipline and willpower to maintain diets and workout regimens, which contributes to obesity and type 2 diabetes\u2014a serious condition we hear so much about. While we\u2019ve heard about revolutionary GLP-1 drugs for some time, there was always skepticism about their long-term performance. However, the results from the 176-week trial on Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide are game-changing in the fight against diabetes. The average patient lost 23% of their body weight, which makes it more likely that the FDA will approve the drug for widespread use. \u201cWith no real alternative, it\u2019s hard to see how insurance companies can avoid covering these GLP-1 drugs. I feel more optimistic about this after David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, mentioned this morning on Squawk on the Street that the drug will save the healthcare system a lot of money. The initial question was whether these drugs, including tirzepatide\u2014a dual-acting GLP-GIP inhibitor\u2014not only keep you thinner but also healthier. We\u2019re beginning to see that they do. Even though the federal government doesn\u2019t cover these drugs, and many employers don\u2019t either, they should. This will save money for our country in the long term and promote healthier, longer lives. \u201cI\u2019ve been a huge supporter of Eli Lilly for ages, and it remains a major position in the Trust. This news will likely attract new believers. David\u2019s assurance that they\u2019re working on various formulations\u2014such as pill forms, monthly shots, and multi-dose injectables\u2014shows their commitment. They\u2019re investing $18 billion to build manufacturing facilities for these drugs, a feat few other companies can afford. While competitors may have something up their sleeves, right now, Lilly is the clear leader, with Novo Nordisk in second place. The rest are still stuck in the FDA approval process, which could take years. \u201cLilly started this journey back in 2016, and the competition is nowhere near catching up. There\u2019s a significant misunderstanding about what this drug can achieve. It\u2019s not just for weight loss and diabetes; it will be prescribed for conditions like congestive heart failure, liver disease, hypertension, and more. It might even become a treatment for alcoholism and sleep apnea. That\u2019s why I believe Eli Lilly, currently worth $92 billion, could eventually join the trillion-dollar club. \u201cEveryone is searching for a drug company that can challenge Lilly, but Lilly\u2019s deep moat and protection from competition make it hard to beat. Although the stock didn\u2019t close above its previous highs today\u2014potentially signaling a double top\u2014I urge you to think bigger. One day, we\u2019ll recognize that tens of millions of people have been freed from the constraints of diet and exercise regimens, thanks to Eli Lilly.\u201d\n\nOverall, LLY ranks 2nd on our list of healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.

They had witnessed a growth of 12.5 per cent in revenues from the US market in H1 FY2025.\n\nHowever, high incidences of warning letters and import alerts by the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) remain a key credit risk. These not only lead to delays in product launches, but also failure in supplying penalties and the incurring of additional costs towards remedial measures, thus impacting revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nPharma companies have taken several measures to combat various US market-related risks.

Access to TB treatment and coverage in India increased by 32% in the last eight years from 53% in 2015 to 85% in 2023, they said.\n\nWith the TB Mukt Bharat - a 100-day intensified campaign - India will cover 347 selected high-priority districts across 33 states/Union Territories that reported a high death rate, low testing, and high incidence of TB. The scheme, which was launched on December 7, will conclude in March 2025.\n\nThe major challenge, however, is a shortage of drugs for TB patients. Though the government has said they have sufficient storage, former AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said this delay is not good for TB patients as it can lead to the emergence of resistance.\n\nAccording to Dr Jayadevan, vector control programs need to be ramped up to tackle the rising cases of dengue, which saw nearly two lakh cases and 160 deaths this year, as well as malaria.\n\nBringing much cheer to combating dengue, India has started dengue vaccine trials and hopefully will be able to launch them in the coming year. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), US) developed this recombinant vaccine, and the technology has been transferred to several companies worldwide.\n\nWhile the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) approved 19 new drugs in 2024, including cancer drugs, many new drugs will enter Indian markets in 2025, including global giant Eli Lilly's diabetes and obesity treatment drug.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOptimism for High Growth Despite High Rates and Debt\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump\u2019s policies take effect.\n\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed\u2019s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\n\nFed\u2019s Shifting Rate Path Sparks Concerns in the Market\n\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed\u2019s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn\u2019t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn\u2019t ruling out anything.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\n\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed\u2019s path forward.",

While Wegovy caused an average weight loss of 13.7 per cent body weight, Zepbound promoted around 20.2 per cent body weight loss in patients.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, tirzepatide also received US FDA approval for obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nTirzepatide is being investigated for four additional indications, including cardiovascular risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\n\u201cIndeed, semaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors, and is in development for four additional indications, including chronic kidney disease,\u201d said the report.\n\nAccording to GlobalData drugs database, more than 400 companies are actively developing obesity drugs, from discovery to pre-registration candidates.\n\nThe impact of Wegovy on the obesity market has been huge. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData defined it as \u201crevolutionary\u201d.\n\nWith Zepbound, the revolution continues, and Eli Lilly's drug is more potent, and perhaps negotiations with national health services will also make it more cost-effective than Wegovy, said Alciati. \u201cSo, Zepbound is expected to take the lead in the obesity market if it hasn't already done so\u201d.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Symptoms include snoring and fatigue, making the condition easily overlooked by doctors. The disorder is common in people who are overweight or obese, although it can affect anyone. Studies show Zepbound can improve the condition by reducing body weight, according to the FDA.\n\nThe move comes as weight-loss medications have garnered immense national attention and ignited a debate about access and demand for the drugs, which help people shave pounds.\n\nThe FDA first approved Zepbound to treat obesity in November 2023. Its active ingredient, tirzepatide, was previously approved as Mounjaro to treat Type 2 diabetes and became popular as an off-label weight-loss treatment.\n\nTirzepatide works by stimulating two hormones that slow the stomach from emptying and signal a sense of fullness to the brain, suppressing appetite and helping control blood-sugar levels.\n\nDemand for Zepbound and Mounjaro has been so hot that Eli Lilly has struggled to make enough, leading the FDA to place it on a list of drugs in shortage and enabling compounding pharmacies to make cheaper, off-brand copies of it. On Dec. 26, the FDA officially declared the shortage over, a long-sought victory for Lilly.\n\nLilly recorded $3 billion in sales from Zepbound in the first nine months of the year, according to a securities filing, making it one of the company\u2019s top-selling drugs.\n\nSleep apnea has historically been treated with therapies such as the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which delivers air through a mask while a person sleeps.\n\nMedicare does not cover weight-loss drugs specifically for obesity, although the medications can be covered for conditions exacerbated by obesity, such as diabetes or heart disease.\n\n\u201c[Friday\u2019s] decision likely opens the door to Medicare coverage of an anti-obesity medication a bit wider than when the FDA approved Wegovy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction early in 2024,\u201d Juliette Cubanski, a deputy director of KFF, a nonpartisan health-care research organization, wrote in an email.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration proposed expanding coverage of weight-loss drugs for millions of people on Medicare and Medicaid, teeing up a clash with the President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration, which is charged with deciding whether to finalize the plan.\n\nState Medicaid programs only have to cover these drugs for conditions such as diabetes or heart disease; roughly 13 states also cover the drugs specifically for obesity, according to KFF. The rules have limited who can get these medications because of their cost.",

Projections indicate that biosimilars and generics will lead to a $192 billion loss for originator products by 2028, with biosimilar market share increasing and driving substantial cost savings.\n\nDespite challenges like uptake disparities and safety concerns, the growing biosimilar market\u2014expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032\u2014will reshape treatment options, particularly in oncology, while the role of unbranded biologics is anticipated to diminish due to legislative reforms targeting drug prices.\n\nHere are the top 5 biosimilar articles in 2024.\n\nImage credit: lexiconimages - stock.adobe.com\n\n5. IQVIA Projects $192 Billion Loss for Originators by 2028 Thanks to Biosimilar, Generic Competition\n\nThe IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science predicted that losses for originator products due to biosimilars and generics will rise from $111 billion to $192 billion by 2028, with the US accounting for $145.5 billion of this impact. The report also highlighted that, while the biosimilar market is expected to reduce spending on reference biologics by $39.5 billion, global medicine spending will grow by 5% to 8%, reaching $2.3 trillion by 2028. Specialty medicines, oncology, and immunology are key areas driving this growth, though price pressures and competition from generics and biosimilars will influence market dynamics.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n4. Biosimilars Account for 23% Market Share, With Wide Uptake Disparities Across Molecules\n\nBiosimilars currently account for 23% of the biologics market but show significant variation in uptake across different molecules, with early uptake reaching over 50% in some cases. Despite contributing to reduced drug costs, biosimilars face challenges like insurer contracts and formulation differences, which have slowed adoption, particularly for high-cost biologics like adalimumab. Over the next 5 years, biosimilar growth will play a key role in reducing biologic spending, particularly with upcoming exclusivity losses for major drugs like natalizumab and ustekinumab.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n3. Budget Impact Analysis of Biosimilar Natalizumab in the US\n\nAn article, published in The American Journal of Managed Care\u00ae, assessed the financial impact of incorporating biosimilar natalizumab into the formulary for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treatment from a US commercial payer perspective. The study projects a total savings of $452,611 over 3 years, with the mean savings per treated member increasing annually, as biosimilar natalizumab uptake grows. These savings were primarily driven by lower drug acquisition costs, highlighting the potential for increased access to high-efficacy treatments for patients with RRMS while reducing overall payer spending.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n2. Global Biosimilar Market Projected to Reach $1.3 Trillion by 2032\n\nThe global biosimilar market is expected to grow from $25.1 billion in 2022 to approximately $1.3 trillion by 2032, driven by the rising prevalence of cancer and the cost-effectiveness of biosimilars. While biosimilars offer affordable treatment options, particularly in oncology, concerns about their long-term safety and efficacy remain, necessitating ongoing research and monitoring. The increasing demand for biosimilars, fueled by the expiration of patents and cost benefits, is also fostering innovation, particularly from start-up companies that are helping to expand patient access despite challenges in manufacturing and regulation.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\n1. The Underlying Economics of Unbranded Biologics\n\nIn a contributor piece, the role of unbranded biologics is explored, highlighting their use in maintaining inflated list prices to protect market share and counter biosimilar competition. These unbranded variants are often launched as a tactic to safeguard the gross-to-net bubble, especially after the loss of exclusivity, and have been commonly used in high-cost treatments like insulin and monoclonal antibodies. However, with recent and upcoming legislative changes aimed at reducing drug costs, such as the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act, the relevance of unbranded biologics is expected to decline, particularly in insulin markets where list prices have already been significantly reduced.\n\nTo read the full article, click here.",

The drug huminsulin is advised to improve blood sugar regulation in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nInsulin therapy is the cornerstone of type 1 diabetes management and is also necessary as type 2 diabetes worsens. Furthermore, according to a press release from Lupin, Insulin Human is advised in combination with other complementary therapies for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, which affect a significant percentage of the Indian population.\n\nLupin focuses on pharmaceutical products, including biotechnology products, complex generics, branded and generic formulations, and active pharmaceutical ingredients. The company holds a significant market share in both India and the United States in several therapeutic areas, including respiratory, cardiovascular, anti-diabetic, anti-infective, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and women\u2019s health.\n\n\n\nLupin has been working hard lately to increase the number of its diabetes medications available in the US. Following the announcement that it will buy three anti-diabetic medications from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company recently announced that it would buy Huminsulin from Eli Lilly. This move is expected to bolster Lupin\u2019s diabetology division, which now makes up around 20% of its domestic portfolio, according to ICICI Securities.\n\nOn 13 December 2024, Lupin announced that it will be expanding its diabetes portfolio in the country by purchasing the anti-diabetes trademarks for AJADUO (Empagliflozin + Linagliptin), GIBTULIO (Empagliflozin), and GIBTULIO MET (Empagliflozin + Metformin) from Boehringer Ingelheim International.

            "content": "Investing in rapidly expanding biotech stocks can be a worthwhile long-term investment. Just one successful drug or device can propel a biotech company to new heights. And biotech companies that use cutting-edge technology or treat complex diseases will always be in demand.\n\nOne such company is Eli Lilly LLY, a global pharmaceutical leader that has been a standout performer in the stock market in recent years. Over the past 10 years, the stock has increased by 1,035.2%. It is known for developing ground-breaking treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancer, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, skin diseases, and other conditions.\n\nIts innovative approach has resulted in a strong portfolio of drugs, including Trulicity, Jardiance, and Verzenio, which generate significant revenue. Furthermore, its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have caught both investors\u2019 and Wall Street\u2019s attention.\n\nWith the year ending, Eli Lilly stock has gained 33% so far, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s SPX gain of 24%. Currently, Eli Lilly is valued at a market cap of $743.4 million. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer believes Eli Lilly will soon be part of the $1 trillion market capitalization club.\n\nLet\u2019s find out if it\u2019s the right time to buy, hold, or sell Eli Lilly stock.\n\nThe Bull Case for Eli Lilly Stock\n\nEli Lilly has a robust pipeline of drugs aimed at high-impact diseases. Its financial results showcase its strong operational performance and market leadership. Lilly\u2019s third-quarter total revenue increased by 20% to $11.4 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $1.18 from $0.10 in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin increased to 82.2% from 81.7% in Q3 2023.\n\nManagement stated that weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound contributed the most to revenue from new products, which increased by $3 billion. Notably, these two drugs combined generated $4.37 billion in total revenue in Q3, trailing only Verzenio ($1.4 billion for advanced or metastatic breast cancer) and Trulicity ($1.3 billion for Type 2 diabetes).\n\nThe company's non-incretin revenue increased by 17% overall, thanks to its oncology, immunology, and neuroscience portfolios.\n\nRecently, Eli Lilly received approval in China for Kisunla, which treats adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The drug is already approved in the U.S., Japan, and Great Britain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved Ebglyss for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and children aged 12 years or older.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s diabetes and weight-loss drugs have been successful and remain in high demand, despite competition from Novo Nordisk\u2019s NVO competitors Wegovy and Ozempic. Eli Lilly can capitalize on the growing weight-loss drugs market, which is projected to be worth $82.8 billion by 2032.\n\nFurthermore, Jim Cramer believes that these drugs could help treat a variety of other conditions, including cardiovascular and liver disease. On Dec. 20, the FDA approved Zepbound to treat sleep apnea for adults with obesity.\n\nMore Growth for Eli Lilly\n\nIn the third quarter, Eli Lilly completed the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutic, which develops oral integrin therapies. Despite ongoing investments in developing its pipeline and strategic acquisitions, the company\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. At the end of the third quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.37 billion.\n\nFurthermore, Eli Lilly is also a dividend stock. Its yield of 0.77% is moderate when compared to the healthcare industry average of 1.58%. Nonetheless, the company has consistently paid dividends over the last 34 years.\n\nIts forward payout ratio of 26.5% indicates that its current earnings can sustain dividend payments with room for growth. On Dec. 9, Eli Lilly announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. The company completed its previous $5 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. It also announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, marking the company\u2019s seventh consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nHowever, its debt-to-equity ratio is quite high at 2.03x, which is not unusual for growing biotech companies. As of October 2024, Eli Lilly had spent $14.8 billion on research and development, capital investments, and business development expenses, paying out $3.5 billion in dividends and $0.4 billion worth of share repurchases.\n\nLooking ahead, management expects 2024 adjusted EPS to fall between $13.02 and $13.52, compared to $6.32 in 2023. Revenue could rise to $45.4 billion to $46 billion from $34.1 billion in 2023, according to consensus estimates.\n\nAnalysts expect Lilly\u2019s earnings to rise by 107.8% in 2024, followed by another 72.3% increase in 2025.\n\nWhat Is Wall Street Saying About Eli Lilly?\n\nOverall, analysts maintain a \"Strong Buy\" rating for Eli Lilly, citing strong growth in the obesity drug market, expansion of its oncology portfolio, and positive pipeline developments. This month alone, Leerink Partners, Citi, Jefferies, Bernstein, and a number of other analysts have reiterated their \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock. Analysts at these firms believe that new approvals and the company\u2019s strategic expansion position it for long-term success.\n\nOut of 25 analysts covering the stock, 20 have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, one has a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and four rate it a \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nThe average target price of $1,005.42 suggests the stock has upside potential of 28.4% above current levels. However, its high target price of $1,250 implies potential upside of 59.6% over the next 12 months.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nOverall, Eli Lilly\u2019s innovative pipeline, strategic acquisitions, strong financial performance, and focus on high-growth therapeutic areas like obesity and oncology position the company well for long-term growth.\n\nInvestors looking for biotech exposure should consider Eli Lilly as a long-term growth play. Eli Lilly stock is somewhat expensive, trading at 34.6x forward 2025 earnings. However, I believe that the company\u2019s successful portfolio and ongoing developments position it for long-term growth, which may justify the premium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nInnovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nIn addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most.

            "content": "Stocks splits have been a huge market theme in 2024, with big names across industries, from technology giant Nvidia to consumer stock Walmart completing such operations. Companies often launch this move after a long period of gains as a way to make their stock price more accessible to a wide range of investors. A stock split doesn't change the overall market value of a company or anything fundamental -- but through the issuance of more shares to current holders, it lowers the per-share price.\n\nSince stock splits don't impact the company's earnings or future prospects, they aren't catalysts for share price performance -- investors generally won't buy or sell a stock just because it completed a stock split. But investors still like these operations for at least two reasons. First, as mentioned, they open up the investment opportunity to more people, and second, a split suggests a company is confident in its future -- with the idea that the stock will rise again from the new lower price.\n\nAnd that's why investors are always on the lookout for the next stock split, particularly when a company's shares have soared. Today, as we search for an upcoming stock-split candidate, we can consider a major pharmaceutical company that sells one of the world's most in-demand products. Will this company announce a stock split in 2025? Let's gather some clues.\n\nLilly's weight loss portfolio\n\nThe company I'm referring to is Eli Lilly (LLY -2.46%), maker of a wide variety of drugs across indications such as oncology and diabetes. But the Lilly portfolio that's getting the most attention these days is the weight loss one. Lilly sells the molecule tirzepatide under the name Zepbound for weight loss and under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, but doctors have prescribed either one for patients looking to lose weight.\n\nBoth of these drugs have become blockbusters, and high demand suggests growth will continue. The obesity drug market may reach $130 billion by the end of the decade, according to Goldman Sachs Research. And Lilly, a leader in the market along with rival Novo Nordisk, is likely to benefit from the opportunity.\n\nThe popularity of Zepbound and Mounjaro has helped Lilly report double-digit revenue growth in recent quarters. And this also has resulted in strong share price performance for the company. Regulators first approved Mounjaro in May 2022 for type 2 diabetes, but as mentioned, doctors also prescribed the drug off-label for weight loss. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration then approved Zepbound for weight management a year ago.\n\nFrom the Mounjaro approval through today, Lilly stock has gained about 160% and now trades for more than $700 a share. At its peak in September, it traded at about $960.\n\nA potential stock split?\n\nConsidering this fantastic performance, investors have been wondering whether this big pharma company will launch a stock split. History shows us Lilly is open to such operations because it launched four in the past. But it's important to note that the most recent one was back in 1997. So this hasn't been part of Lilly's recent story.\n\nAnd, today, Lilly's stock has come down from that near-$1,000 level that sometimes represents a psychological barrier for investors: They see the stock as expensive at such a price even if its valuation looks fine. I actually thought Lilly would launch a stock split earlier this year, as the price soared beyond $900, but that didn't happen. These points don't support the idea of a new split on the horizon.\n\nStill, Lilly is trading close to a record high and at a price level that's well above peers' -- including fellow weight loss drug leader Novo Nordisk.\n\nLLY data by YCharts\n\nThis could make some investors think twice before investing in Lilly, and that may hurt the stock's momentum.\n\nThe recent pullback we've seen in Lilly shares could prompt management to consider the idea of a split as a way to open up the investment opportunity to more investors and remind them that the weight loss drug story may be in its early chapters. That's why I'm still watching for a stock-split announcement from this big pharma player -- and it could happen as early as 2025 as Lilly's weight loss drugs continue to deliver blockbuster revenue and solid growth.",

            "content": "Investors worldwide are scouring for their next big win after the door to the extremely lucrative obesity market was opened by pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Now benefiting on the Swedish stock exchange is a smaller Nordic biotech company.\n\n\u00d7 Expand Pila Pharma\n\nPila Pharma, a smaller Nordic biotech company listed on the Nasdaq First North exchange in Stockholm, has enjoyed an unusually good stock market year. The company was founded by Dorte X. Gram, a former Novo Nordisk researcher who during her time at the company discovered a potentially new mechanism of action for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Pila Pharma, which went public in the summer of 2021, has experienced an impressive development on the stock exchange throughout 2024, seeing a triple-digit percentage gain from the beginning of the year to now.\n\nThe company\u2019s main asset is a TRPV1 antagonist, which is a drug class not previously associated for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Named XEN-D0501, the asset is formulated as an oral tablet and is currently undergoing clinical phase II testing as a treatment for overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. According to Pila Pharma CEO Gustav H. Gram, the company\u2019s stated belief in the drug\u2019s potential to treat obesity, is likely part of the driving force behind the stock increase.\n\n\"These years stock developments for a lot of companies in this segment, illustrates that obesity medication is on everybody\u2019s minds. We are of course pleased that investors are now looking at us as a potential player with an innovative approach, even though we still have progress to make, before we can potentially assess whether our unique and potential first-in-class drug, could become a player for the continuously growing and fragmenting obesity market\" said Gustav H. Gram. \" We potentially have a very interesting drug candidate, which could have helpful effects on these very common global diseases of diabetes and obesity and would differentiate itself from other, currently approved drugs. This is a tablet-based formulation for which we see broad demand on a global scale, and it has a different side-effect profile than the GLP-1 drugs that are known to cause nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\"\n\nInvestors are searching for stocks with high potential\n\nJ.P. Morgan has previously estimated that the global obesity market could exceed $100 billion by 2030. The market\u2019s development is primarily driven by the big diabetes and obesity rivals, US-based Eli Lilly and Denmark-based Novo Nordisk, and their GLP-1 drugs for obesity treatment. Besides the two big players, investors might recognize other Nordic players in the field such as Zealand Pharma and Gubra from Denmark, and US-based Viking Therapeutics, all of which are also developing complex peptide-based products for the next generation of obesity drugs.\n\n\"A trend seems to be forming where many investors are looking for new assets from companies that develop novel and innovative projects to address future demand in a fragmenting market. My guess is that our completely different approach, as well as our lower valuation compared to others, might be why many investors have taken an interest in us recently\" said Gustav H. Gram. \"The obesity market has experienced huge uptake and value growth but we\u2019re still far from reaching the point of saturation with current injectable products. The industry is actively looking for new molecules with mechanisms of action that can improve treatment options and increase competition on the market, provided they\u2019re able to show good efficacy and side-effect profiles.\"\n\nResults spark interest\n\nIn past months, Pila Pharma has experienced a large uptick in international shareholder numbers, and while the new co-owners are welcomed, the company is eyeing a future with more long-term investors at the table.\n\n\"The strength of being a stock that\u2019s attractive to private investors shouldn\u2019t be underestimated but we are hoping and of course working toward getting heavier and more long-term institutional investors on board as our valuation hopefully increases. However, in order to attract the interest of larger asset managers and pension funds, we need to be able to show more results. So of course, generating new data plays a central role in our long-term plan to increase our valuation and to make the stock more solid\" said Gustav. H. Gram.\n\nAt the moment, Pila Pharma is making the last preparations before a new, larger safety study in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity can commence. In addition to evaluating safety, the company will also look at efficacy parameters such as weight reduction.\n\nThe company\u2019s primary drug candidate, XEN-D0501, has in earlier studies shown promising effects in diabetes as well as a large reduction in a biomarker for heart failure. Pila Pharma is therefore also greatly focused on the molecule being tested as a treatment for other diseases that are associated with diabetes and obesity, including different cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the main diabetes track, the company has just initiated a new preclinical study to investigate decrease in progression of abdominal aorta aneurysms, which is a cardiovascular disease.",
