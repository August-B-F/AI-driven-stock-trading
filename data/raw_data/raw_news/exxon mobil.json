Few industries understand this better than oil and gas, which has benefited for at least a century from some tax rules that save them billions of dollars in payments annually.\n\nThe world\u2019s nations have agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies globally. The Biden administration pledged to axe them domestically. Still, they persist.\n\nNow, with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration determined to enact $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and desperately looking for revenue and spending cuts to pay for them, some environmental advocacy groups are highlighting the tax benefits that flow to one of the world\u2019s most profitable industries, which the Biden administration estimated at $110 billion over the decade ending in 2034.\n\nThe oil and gas industry, meanwhile, is playing both offense and defense, trying to maintain the benefits it has while working to enact at least one new one, which would shield some oil companies from a tax enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\n\u201cThey make huge payments to governments around the world, including to some in some pretty shady places.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest sources of new revenue from the IRA was a corporate alternative minimum tax, which was meant to prevent companies that reported large profits to investors from using loopholes to pay little to no taxes.\n\nThe minimum tax applies to all industries. For oil and gas, it has hit some of the large independent drillers in particular (as opposed to the \u201cintegrated\u201d majors like ExxonMobil and Chevron). The money involved is significant: According to a new analysis by United to End Polluter Handouts, a coalition of environmental and progressive groups, at least three companies\u2014EOG Resources, APA Corp. and Ovintiv\u2014reported paying nearly $200 million collectively to the Treasury under the minimum tax since it was enacted in 2022.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-OK) has introduced a bill that would change the calculus by allowing oil companies to deduct some of their largest expenses against the minimum tax. Lankford\u2019s bill is included as a priority in the policy blueprint of the American Exploration & Production Council, which represents large independent oil and gas companies.\n\nLukas Shankar-Ross, an author of the new minimum-tax analysis and deputy director of the climate and energy justice program at Friends of the Earth, pointed out that the Lankford bill would either deepen deficits or force more cuts to programs like Medicaid or other assistance for low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cI think it is as shameful a thing for me to imagine as is possible now,\u201d Shankar-Ross said.\n\nThe oil and gas sector is the top industry contributor to Lankford\u2019s campaigns in recent years, giving more than $546,000 since 2019, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nA spokesperson for Lankford said, \u201cPromoting American energy independence is a reversal of the Biden Administration\u2019s policies. Strong domestic energy production makes us less reliant on adversaries, and empowering oil and gas producers makes the United States stronger. Nobody is looking at cutting Medicaid benefits in order to pay for tax cuts, but fraud, waste, and abuse in the program should be examined.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the largest oil and gas companies, however, their focus might be elsewhere. When the American Petroleum Institute issued its five-point policy roadmap for the Trump administration and Congress in November, it highlighted a need to maintain what it called \u201ccrucial international tax provisions.\u201d\n\nJust one of those provisions, the so-called dual capacity taxpayer rule, is expected to save oil and gas companies $71.5 billion over a decade, according to Biden administration estimates.\n\nBroadly speaking, federal tax law allows corporations to credit taxes they pay to foreign governments on overseas income against their US tax bills to avoid being taxed twice. The dual capacity taxpayer rule allows oil companies wide latitude in defining what exactly constitutes a tax payment, with the result being that they can count royalties and other payments as taxes, said Zorka Milin, policy director at the Financial Accountability & Corporate Transparency Coalition, which works to combat harmful impacts of illicit finance.\n\nIn fact, in some cases U.S. oil and gas companies might pay more in taxes and other payments to foreign governments than they do to the United States.\n\nExxon paid billions in overseas royalties alone in 2023, including $1.8 billion to the United Arab Emirates, $1 billion to the Canadian province Alberta, and $761 million to Nigeria. Chevron paid about $2 billion in royalties to foreign governments.\n\nMilin said it is unclear how much of these royalty payments Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies might have claimed as credits against their US taxes, but it could run into the billions of dollars annually.\n\n\u201cThey make huge payments to governments around the world, including to some in some pretty shady places, and what is adding insult to injury is a lot of those payments are used to offset payments they pay here in the US,\u201d Milin said. \u201cThat\u2019s one way in which our tax code is subsidizing these companies to go abroad and drill, baby, drill, but not domestically.\u201d\n\nExxon, Chevron and the American Petroleum Institute did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, which supports pro-growth tax policies, said many of the oil industry-specific tax rules do not qualify as subsidies. Several of the rules, such as one that allows oil companies to deduct their drilling costs upfront, rather than over a well\u2019s productive life, put the industry on an equal footing with other sectors, he argued. Oil companies often have high costs upfront that generate returns over many years, which can put them at a tax disadvantage with other industries, Muresianu said.\n\nWhen it comes to royalties, these payments to mineral owners are generally tax deductible. But the dual capacity taxpayer rule offers a far better deal by turning them into a credit, an important distinction. Say Company A earned $100 million in profits, paid $5 million in royalties and paid the full 21 percent corporate income tax. Taking the royalty payments as a credit rather than a deduction would save it nearly $4 million. (US tax laws are complex, so limitations might apply.)\n\nMilin argued that Congress ought to look at the foreign tax breaks, especially as they are searching for more revenue, because these benefits effectively subsidize oil companies to drill overseas. \u201cWhen we have a more explicitly America First international economic policy on trade, on other issues, I think they are likely to look at the ways in which the tax code as it stands is inconsistent with that,\u201d Milin said.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Battery Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best battery stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nBatteries are essential to our global energy landscape, especially nowadays, as they contribute heavily in accomplishing clean energy goals. These batteries power numerous electric vehicles (EVs) in the transport sector; on the other hand, they play a crucial role in the power sector, where energy storage is growing faster than any other clean technology, supporting the renewable energy shift.\n\nFurthermore, the global battery industry is facing rapid growth due to lower costs and higher demand. A critical point was reached when prices of battery packs for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) dropped below $100 per kilowatt-hour. As a result of this cost-competitiveness, these batteries became highly demanded for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Thus, according to The Business Research Company, the EV battery market is expected to jump from $66.43 billion in 2024 to $87.78 billion in 2025, showing a 32.1% yearly growth rate.\n\nThis growth majorly stems from decreasing battery mineral costs, especially lithium. The World Economic Forum reported that lithium-ion battery costs have dropped over 90% in the past decade, with a 40% drop in 2024 alone. The IEA points out that a rise in manufacturing and improved production methods drove the market, with global battery production hitting 3 TWh in 2024. Accordingly, this has sped up EV adoption, with S&P Global Mobility forecasting 15.1 million battery electric vehicle sales in 2025. These sales would be 30% higher than the 2024 level and would make up 16.7% of global light vehicle sales.\n\nMoving on to China, which is a lead battery producer, we see that it makes up 75% of the total global production, as reported by Reuters. China\u2019s vertically integrated supply chain, from refining minerals to producing batteries, has allowed manufacturers to scale up efficiently and reduce costs. Furthermore, Chinese companies pioneered the shift to lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, currently making up nearly half of the global EV market. These batteries cost about 30% less than lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) substitutes while offering similar performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. energy storage industry faces challenges as new tariffs on Chinese battery parts increase costs. With lithium battery tariffs set to reach 25% by 2026, along with other rising import duties, project costs are climbing. Thus, Wood Mackenzie predicts slower storage installations, with yearly growth dropping to 10% between 2025-2028, down from 25% in 2024. As a result, lithium demand is likely to be affected, adding uncertainty to battery prices globally.\n\nBesides lithium batteries, hydrogen is emerging as another clean energy alternative. KPMG reported rising investment in fuel cell technology, establishing hydrogen as a long-term player in clean energy. A 2024 IDTechEx report estimated that only 4% of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) will use hydrogen in the next two decades. However, at the same time, it predicts that about 19% of zero-emission trucks could be hydrogen-powered by 2044. According to KPMG\u2019s Fuels of the Future study, electric batteries remain the leading low-carbon technology, preferred by 48% of experts. Yet 16% of experts note the potential of hydrogen fuel cells as a comparable alternative.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the battery market is shifting rapidly as costs drop, technology improves, and market competition intensifies. Falling lithium prices and economies of scale drive further growth, while hydrogen\u2019s increasing adoption points to a multi-technology energy future. Considering this momentum of electrification, battery stocks offer strong investment potential in the evolving clean energy market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to compile our list of the 12 Best Battery Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. We selected the top 12 stocks based on the number of billionaire investors as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 16\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), is a major integrated energy company that operates across upstream, downstream, and low-carbon solutions. It is expanding into decarbonized power for data centers, targeting the provision of low-emission energy to data centers, with initial operations planned by 2028. The company leverages its complete carbon capture, transport, and storage (CCS) system as a competitive edge in industrial decarbonization.\n\nDespite market challenges, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) earned $34 billion in 2024\u2014its third-best decade result. It generated $55 billion in operational cash flow due to strong Upstream and Product Solutions performances. However, for Q4 ended December 31, 2024, EPS dropped to $1.67 per share versus an expected $1.77 per share. Still, the company hit record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, with Permian output projected to grow from 1.5 million barrels daily in 2024 to 2.3 million by 2030.\n\nExxon Mobil is moving forward with four CCS projects launching within the next two years. The company\u2019s low-carbon segment, including CCS, hydrogen, and lithium should add $2 billion to earnings by 2030. These moves not only support cleaner energy growth but also use existing infrastructure for long-term profitability.\n\nThus, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) continues integrating low-carbon solutions while maintaining its conventional energy strength. With careful capital management and strategic investments, the company aims for sustained earnings growth. Furthermore, Exxon\u2019s CCS and hydrogen expansion may strengthen its position as industries shift toward reduced emissions. As such, it is among the best battery stocks to buy.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 2nd on our list of best battery stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 21, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX and National Fuel Gas Co. NFG.\n\nHow to Invest During a Correction\n\nIt seems like a distinct possibility that the current market pullback could last for an extended period. Of course, I do not know the exact path the market will take moving forward, but the best thing we as investors can do is prepare for all the possible scenarios ahead of us, especially the worst case.\n\nIf markets rebound from here, investors can resume the strategies we were all using before, following the AI boom and owning tech stocks. However, in the case of a further downturn and even a possible bear market I have some ideas for how to get defensive and hopefully even turn a profit.\n\nThere is one sector in the market that is showing obvious outperformance over the last week, month and YTD and boasts some of the cheapest companies in the market \u2013 the energy sector. Furthermore, during the most recent bear market, in 2022, energy was a bright spot as investors rotated into real assets and held up performance of the savviest investors. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and National Fuel Gas Co. are three energy stocks I believe can outperform in good times or bad.\n\nChevron Stock Stages Technical Breakout\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest vertically integrated energy companies in the world, Chevron is a juggernaut in the sector that has put up enviable long-term returns. The company also currently pays a 4.2% dividend yield, providing a nice income for patient investors.\n\nChevron currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a mixed earnings revision trend. The company is expected to grow its earnings 17.7% this year and 10.1% annually over the next three to five years. At 15.2x forward earnings, CVX\u2019s valuation is about in line with its long-term median of 13x forward earnings. While fairly valued at the time, the key catalyst which should drive the stock higher is investors seeking some sort of defensive positioning, as these mega cap energy companies boast strong business models and steady cash flows.\n\nAs an investor who follows technicals, Chevron price action is offering clear signals. After consolidating for the last two years CVX stock has broken out of its range, indicating that investors are piling into the stock. Whether the volatility in stock continues or not, CVX appears to be a compelling investment option.\n\nExxon Mobil Stock Outperformed During 2022 Bear Market\n\nExxon Mobil, like Chevron is a mammoth company, diversified across all segments of the industry and provides investors with a steady stream of profits and dividend payments. Premier assets such as these energy companies give investors exposure to real assets, which provide critical services to the world\u2019s economy and become especially scarce when uncertainty is on the rise.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s XOM Australian unit and Woodside Energy have approved the final investment decision for the Turrum Phase 3 project, a $221 million initiative aimed at tapping underdeveloped gas resources in the Gippsland Basin. The project will involve drilling five new wells in the Turrum and North Turrum gas fields, ensuring continued gas supply for Australia\u2019s east coast.\n\nAustralia's competition regulator has warned that the country\u2019s east coast could face gas shortages from 2027, potentially leading to reliance on imports. The Turrum Phase 3 project is seen as a critical step in mitigating this shortfall, contributing to the domestic market\u2019s stability. Simon Younger, the chair of ExxonMobil Australia, noted that although the Gippsland Basin's resources will eventually be depleted, projects like Turrum will help sustain gas production in the Bass Strait beyond 2030.\n\nThe Gippsland Basin joint venture, a 50-50 partnership between Esso Australia Resources (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil) and Woodside Energy (Bass Strait), is operated by Esso Australia. The approval of Turrum Phase 3 follows the recent greenlight for the Kipper 1B project, another development aimed at increasing gas output from the region.\n\nWoodside\u2019s executive vice president, Liz Westcott, highlighted that these investments are crucial for preventing future supply shortages. She emphasized that all gas from the Bass Strait fields supports Australia\u2019s domestic market.\n\nWith ExxonMobil and Woodside pushing forward with these projects, the Australian energy market is set to receive a much-needed boost in gas supply, potentially stabilizing domestic prices and ensuring energy security beyond the next decade.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like Archrock Inc. AROC, NextDecade Corporation NEXT and Oceaneering International, Inc. OII. While Archrock presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NextDecade and Oceaneering each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nArchrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues.\n\nNextDecade is an emerging player in the LNG space with its Rio Grande LNG project in Texas. As demand for LNG continues to grow, the company\u2019s strategic investments in infrastructure and planned liquefaction capacity provide strong upside potential. With the global LNG market expanding, NEXT is well-positioned to tap into the increasing export demand from the United States.",

The purchases were made between January and March this year, and the stake is worth about $2.3 billion at today\u2019s share prices.\n\nThe purchases \u201creflect Chevron\u2019s continuing confidence in the consummation of the pending acquisition of Hess,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe long-running battle between Chevron and archrival Exxon over Hess has captivated both the oil industry and merger-arbitrage traders looking to capitalize on the uncertain outcome of arbitration proceedings involving the two US supermajors. If Chevron wins, it gains a 30% share of the world\u2019s fastest-growing major oil project in Guyana, which is operated and 45%-owned by Exxon. But if it loses, the company stands to face questions over its legal judgment as well as its growth plans after 2030.\n\nAbout six months after the deal was agreed, Exxon began arbitration proceedings against Hess and Chevron, arguing it has a right of first refusal over the 30% Guyana stake. Chevron claims the right does not apply in the case of a corporate merger. The case is scheduled to be heard in May with a decision by September.\n\nGiven the Chevron\u2019s current share price, the stock-offer to Hess is worth more than $160, while the Hess shares are trading for about $150 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Factoring in the gap, as well as potential dividend payouts, purchasing shares now gives Chevron an opportunity to lower the cost of the transaction assuming it wins at arbitration and the spread diminishes.\n\nChevron\u2019s purchases of Hess stock this year came in addition to regular buybacks of its own stock, the company said. Chevron bought back $15.2 billion of stock last year, about 5% of its market value, and plans to continue repurchasing shares after the Hess deal closes.\n\nbloomberg.com 03 17 2025",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Michael Cuggino, President and Portfolio Manager of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 and began discussing his fund\u2019s performance. Despite a challenging market environment, his fund achieved a 4% return this year, which he attributed to diversification rather than reliance on a single asset class like gold. The portfolio includes gold, silver, diversified equities, and bonds. When asked about market reactions to tariff-related headlines, Cuggino emphasized the importance of not overreacting to daily news fluctuations. He described the market\u2019s behavior as herky-jerky and advised investors to focus on long-term opportunities rather than reacting impulsively. His base case anticipated some turbulence due to the transition under the new administration\u2019s economic policies. His strategy involves identifying opportunities during volatile periods rather than making significant portfolio changes.\n\nThe discussion also featured David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, who provided insights on Washington\u2019s role in market volatility. Zervos acknowledged that while policies such as tariffs, immigration reforms, and drug policies were largely unfolding as expected, the speed of changes under the current administration was surprising investors. He pointed out rapid spending cuts and layoffs in the public sector as key contributors to market unease. For instance, courts recently ordered the federal government to rehire probationary employees who had been dismissed. Zervos likened this abrupt shift to transitioning from a public-sector-reliant economy to one driven by the private sector, which is a process that has introduced significant uncertainty. Regarding tariffs specifically, Zervos downplayed their overall impact on the US economy, which he described as domestically driven. While tariffs could affect specific industries like wine or automobiles with high overseas components, he argued that broader economic trends would be shaped by deregulation, reduced business costs, and a shift toward private-sector efficiency. He warned that the speed of these transitions could lead to short-term volatility but maintained optimism about long-term productivity gains.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top S&P 500 stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15.

(NYSE:XOM) stands against other profitable value stocks to buy now.\n\nMatt Powers, Managing Partner at Powers Advisory Group, joined the discussion on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Power Lunch\u2019 on March 11 to provide insights into the shift from growth to value investing and the resurgence of traditional dividend strategies. Powers emphasized that this transition has become increasingly evident, particularly following last week\u2019s market activity and the events of March 10. He noted that while the market behavior on March 11 might tell a slightly different story, the broader trend is unmistakable. For years, growth stocks dominated portfolios, but now investors are gravitating toward value and dividend investing, which had been largely overlooked for over a decade. Powers attributed this shift to various catalysts, which included tariffs and policy uncertainty from Washington and President Trump\u2019s unpredictable stances. He described investors as exhausted, and welcomed the normalization of equity markets and a return to diversification and traditional investing.\n\nPowers highlighted the importance of diversification, contrasting high-growth portfolios with those focused on dividends. He pointed out that ETFs have outperformed large-cap growth funds year-to-date, with a notable 11-point difference in returns. The dividend fund is up 5%, while the large-cap growth fund is down 6%. He explained that tech stocks dominate large-cap growth funds and account for nearly half of their portfolios. In contrast, dividend-focused funds are more diversified across sectors such as healthcare, financials, and staples. This diversification reduces concentration risk and provides defensive characteristics in an uncertain market environment. Powers elaborated on the leadership shift between these two types of funds. While growth ETFs feature holdings like the MAG7, dividend ETFs focus on blue-chip companies. A year ago, growth stocks were investor favorites, but now value stocks are taking the lead, which is a trend reflected in their performance. He stressed the importance of broadening diversification within portfolios and not ignoring value opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15.

It was the highest in over 40 years and was driven by the company\u2019s advantaged assets.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM is advancing its oil and gas exploration capabilities by integrating cutting-edge 4D seismic technology with its latest high-performance computing (HPC) system, Discovery 6. The move is expected to significantly reduce seismic processing times and enhance subsurface imaging, helping the energy giant optimize resource recovery.\n\nXOM Integrates 4D Seismic With Discovery 6 Supercomputer\n\nExxonMobil, a pioneer in seismic imaging for nearly five decades, is now leveraging 4D seismic technology along with its next-generation Discovery 6 supercomputer. This system, built in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE and accelerated by NVIDIA, is designed to deliver up to four times the computational power of its predecessor, Discovery 5.\n\nBy utilizing 4D seismic imaging, ExxonMobil can now create high-resolution time-lapse models of underground reservoirs, allowing for more accurate predictions of oil and gas movements. The company anticipates that this will improve well placement, enhance reservoir management and ultimately lead to greater resource recovery at lower costs.\n\nXOM Targets Faster Seismic Processing for Efficient Drilling\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of this technology integration is the reduction of seismic data processing time. Traditionally, processing 4D seismic data has taken months, but with Discovery 6, ExxonMobil expects to cut this timeline down to weeks. The firm\u2019s elastic full wavefield inversion (eFWI) technology refines subsurface imaging by rapidly generating detailed views of rock and fluid properties.\n\nThe company estimates that these advancements could unlock more than $1 billion in potential value from its first six floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units in Guyana\u2019s Stabroek Block. This aligns with ExxonMobil\u2019s broader goal of increasing efficiency while maintaining capital discipline.\n\nXOM's Discovery 6 to Set a New Benchmark in Supercomputing\n\nDiscovery 6 will be equipped with HPE Cray Supercomputing EX4000 technology, featuring 4,032 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips and HPE Slingshot interconnect. Scheduled for installation in the first half of 2025, the system will also employ energy-efficient direct liquid cooling to optimize performance.\n\nExxonMobil highlights that Discovery 6 represents a major leap in computational capabilities, following Discovery 5\u2019s recognition as the 16th fastest supercomputer globally in 2022. The company sees this investment as a crucial step in its strategy to integrate advanced seismic processing across its global operations.\n\nAs ExxonMobil continues to refine its exploration and production strategies, the adoption of 4D seismic imaging and HPC technology reaffirms its commitment to technological innovation in the energy sector.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at a couple of better-ranked stocks like Archrock Inc. AROC and NextDecade Corporation NEXT. While Archrock presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NextDecade carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nArchrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues.\n\nNextDecade is an emerging player in the LNG space with its Rio Grande LNG project in Texas. As demand for LNG continues to grow, the company\u2019s strategic investments in infrastructure and planned liquefaction capacity provide strong upside potential. With the global LNG market expanding, NEXT is well-positioned to tap into the increasing export demand from the United States.\n\nZacks' Research Chief Names \"Stock Most Likely to Double\"\n\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months.

The case is scheduled to be heard in May with a decision by September.\n\nChevron\u2019s purchases of Hess stock this year came in addition to regular buybacks of its own stock, the company said.\n\nWant more news?

            "content": "Eli Hartman/Reuters ExxonMobil plans to forge ahead on increasing oil output over the next five years despite signals that the global market is already oversupplied, the company\u2019s head of shale production told Semafor. The price of oil on the US benchmark fell below $70 per barrel over the last two weeks, as US President Donald Trump\u2019s rapidly-shifting tariff threats have sparked fears of a recession. There may be more downside ahead: The International Energy Agency warned on Thursday that \u201cdeteriorating\u201d macroeconomic conditions and OPEC\u2019s decision to raise its production quotas mean the market will be oversupplied throughout this year, and Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro said the administration would be glad to see prices as low as $50. Exxon has been preparing for a moment like this, said Bart Cahir, the company\u2019s senior vice president for upstream unconventional. Drilling technology innovations and the company\u2019s $60 billion acquisition last year of rival driller Pioneer Natural Resources have helped drive down Exxon\u2019s production costs, giving it a kind of insurance during one of the most uncertain periods in the industry\u2019s history. Exxon can still turn a profit with prices as low as $35, Cahir said, a price that, apart from the pandemic, was last seen in 2003. \u201cWe believe our operating costs are the lowest in the industry, which means we get more out of each barrel we produce,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gives us tremendous resilience when you get into softer parts of the commodity cycle.\u201d For as long as there\u2019s been an oil industry, people have poured enormous effort \u2014 often without much success \u2014 into trying to predict future demand. Today, the question is more urgent, and more uncertain, than ever, as the imperative of decarbonization in the face of the climate crisis collides with surging demand in emerging economies. At the CERAWeek conference in Houston this week, there\u2019s been a \u201creset on the recognition of the pace of the energy transition,\u201d as Cahir put it \u2014 a growing sense that the climate ambitions of former US President Joe Biden and other world leaders are losing political momentum and also running into the hard realities of cost and logistics. If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s bullish for oil. And if it\u2019s not \u2014 in other words, if EVs and renewables gain momentum \u2014 companies like Exxon have little choice but to drill anyway, cutting costs as much as they can and hoping to be the last one standing.

Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali (Co-operative Republic of Guyana) speaks during the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston, Texas, on March 11.\n\nKevin Crowley, Bloomberg News\n\nHOUSTON\n\nEnergiesNet.com 03 14 2025\n\nGuyana President Irfaan Ali is exploring a partnership with Suriname to build a gas-powered industrial hub as he works to fortify his nation\u2019s economy, which was rapidly transformed by oil fortunes in the past decade.\n\nThe nation is seeking the partnership with Suriname for a prospective hub on the north coast of South America that would use natural gas from the countries\u2019 offshore fields, he said in an interview.\n\nAli said he aims \u201cto build regional prosperity\u201d by producing power, fertilizer and aluminum in the Berbice region in eastern Guyana. He spoke on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s oil discovery in 2015 has transformed Guyana\u2019s economic fortunes, filling the government\u2019s coffers with billions of dollars from oil exports. But it\u2019s also left the nation\u2019s outlook extremely intertwined with the whims of the crude market at a time when an expectant population is looking for a rapid uplift in living standards.\n\nAli, who is up for re-election this year, wants to build \u201cresilience\u201d by investing heavily in non-oil sectors, such as agriculture, infrastructure, education and healthcare, he said.\n\nThe hub would be critical for \u201cenergy and food security,\u201d he said as the region seeks to grow its economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping also to discuss with Suriname the integration of their gas into that facility,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat facility would be able to serve both Guyana and Suriname and create the economic spin off and opportunities for both countries.\u201d\n\nGas Developments\n\nLongtail, Exxon\u2019s eighth offshore Guyana project, provides a unique opportunity because unlike the other seven, it\u2019s more focused on natural gas and other hydrocarbon liquids rather than oil. Positioned in the south-east of the Stabroek block, Longtail is not far from where TotalEnergies SE is building the GranMorgu oil project in Suriname.\n\nExxon will present to the Guyanese government several options for gas developments in the coming weeks, Ali said. One idea is to bring some of the gas to shore through a pipeline for domestic use. Another is for floating liquefied natural gas for export.\n\n\u201cThis month we\u2019ll have a fuller understanding because of additional studies will be completed and we\u2019ll have a fuller presentation on what is there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be narrowing the mix of opportunities so we can get this going.\u201d\n\nAli met with US Energy Secretary Chris Wright while in Houston this week. The pair discussed \u201cthe strengthening of the partnership and integration of our energy plans to ensure energy security, energy stability,\u201d Ali said.\n\nVenezuela, the country\u2019s neighbor to the east, sent a patrol ship into Guyanese waters near Exxon\u2019s oil vessels about ten days ago. The move came after Trump announced withdrawing Chevron Corp.\u2019s license to operate in Venezuela and was widely condemned by the US and the international community.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with the US administration is very positive, very constructive, very forward looking,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThat is why you will have seen such strong statements\u201d against Venezuela\u2019s incursion, he said.\n\nbloomberg.com 03 12 2025",

            "content": "News Americas, New York, NY, Fri. March 14, 2025: A consortium led by U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil has unveiled plans for its eighth energy project in Guyana, which is set to produce up to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas and 290,000 barrels per day of condensate. The project will utilize a floating production facility with the capacity to export the fuel, according to details submitted to the Guyanese government.\n\nThe Longtail Project, which includes the development of the Longtail, Tripletail, and Turbot offshore discoveries, was outlined in the group\u2019s request for environmental authorization, recently published by the Guyanese government and reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Guyana offices at 86 Duke Street in Georgetown, Guyana. Photographer: Jose A. Alvarado Jr./Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nLongtail is expected to become Exxon\u2019s most significant gas development in Guyana to date, aligning with the government\u2019s push to increase gas production to support various industries, including petrochemical plants and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.\n\nAccording to the environmental document, the project will involve the drilling of up to 60 production and injection wells, further expanding Guyana\u2019s rapidly growing energy sector.\n\nIn contrast, Guyana\u2019s government has officially pulled the plug on the Frontera-CGX joint venture, canceling its oil prospecting license for the Corentyne Block. This decision, which had been anticipated since February when the government gave the joint venture a 30-day warning, now marks the end of their efforts in the region.\n\nThe Corentyne block had been seen as a potential diversification opportunity in Guyana\u2019s oil industry, which is dominated by ExxonMobil\u2019s operations in the Stabroek Block. Despite being an underdog, the Frontera-CGX partnership had hoped to secure a piece of the pie, but they are now out of the race. While both companies have disputed the cancellation, no further details about potential legal challenges or behind-the-scenes negotiations have emerged.\n\nExxon\u2019s control over Guyana\u2019s offshore oil bonanza has only grown stronger. The company, alongside its partners Hess and CNOOC, is progressing with multiple projects, including the latest Longtail project. Exxon\u2019s ongoing efforts have resulted in over 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil production from several operations in the country. At this pace, Exxon\u2019s presence in Guyana could soon rival that of some OPEC members.\n\nWhile global oil prices remain volatile, with WTI hovering near $67 and Brent struggling above $70, smaller players like Frontera and CGX have faced a difficult challenge. However, Exxon remains well-positioned to continue its dominance in the region, sending a clear message: if you want to drill in Guyana, you\u2019d better have deep pockets and the patience of a major supermajor.",

            "content": "Europe is at a critical point. To lead in reducing emissions, the European Union enacted policies that reduced industrial activity. These rigid policies increased costs, leading to the shutdown of 21 chemical sites in 2023 and our chemical site in France in 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s why EU policy is an important issue for ExxonMobil. With over 100 years in Europe, we are deeply invested in the region's success.\n\nAt a recent event in Antwerp, the EU released new details on a Clean Industrial Deal, with the objective of reducing red tape and increasing investments. From what we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s an encouraging start. But many in the industry are unconvinced the proposals show that Europe is truly open for business.\n\nThe main issue is that Europe has continued to pick winners and losers, rather than fostering an environment where industry and technology can compete to bring innovative solutions.\n\nFor example, the EU wants to reduce emissions from hydrogen use in industry, but it still dictates green hydrogen as the only solution despite lower-cost options being available. Green hydrogen is simply unaffordable in the near to medium term for many industries. So rather than invest in better alternatives, industry players are choosing to rationalize and reduce their production rates, ceding ground to Asia and the Americas.\n\nWhy not set an emissions intensity reduction target and challenge industry to innovate and reduce the cost of carbon reduction?\n\nEurope has the resources, skills and infrastructure to grow its economy and reduce carbon emissions. But it needs supportive policies with clear rules of the road.\n\nA year ago, we asked the EU to use our scientists' and engineers' expertise to contribute to finding diverse solutions for Europe's low-carbon emissions ambitions. We want to be part of the solution.\n\nSince then, our corporation has increased our global plans for lower-emissions investments from $20 billion to $30 billion by 2030. To put this in perspective, our annual worldwide spend is about 50% more than the yearly budget of the EU Innovation Fund. Very little of that is slated to go into our EU assets without changes in policy and the continent is missing out.\n\nThe goal is clear: to reduce emissions and reindustrialize Europe.\n\nWhile the Clean Industrial Deal indicates the EU is listening to industry and wants to help, it remains to be seen whether it is enough to attract a significant portion of ExxonMobil\u2019s planned $30 billion in lower-emission investments.\n\nA successful Europe can push the world and our industry forward. The time to act is now, before it is too late.",

            "content": "However, besides technology, there are some business models that also allow for strong profitability and cash flow. First, there are energy leaders who are literal cash cows and generate tens of billions of dollars annually from energy operations, which are vital to the world economy and are unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon. Second, there is the financial sector, and particularly banks, which are considered the blood of the world economy \u2013 by intermediating operations worth trillions of dollars annually, the leading banks can capture a tiny share of those transactions, which overall results in giant amounts of net profit. Last but not least, some of the most profitable companies in the world can be found even in more competitive sectors like consumer discretionary.\n\nIn the last decade, the most profitable large cap stocks have mostly clustered in the technology sector, leveraging such factors as the giant global total addressable market and wide margins allowed by the technological advantage. Furthermore, some of these companies took the center of the stage during 2023-2024, a time when the AI megatrend opened a new growth frontier and led to rising stock market concentration; in other words, the most profitable companies became even more profitable. This trend has resulted in a widening gap between the leading tech giants and other sectors, as investors increasingly flock to these high-growth stocks, anticipating continued dominance and innovation.\n\nThe most profitable large-cap stocks, in terms of absolute net profit, are typically concentrated in industries with relatively high barriers to entry and substantial global demand. These include sectors like technology, healthcare, energy and consumer goods, where leaders can benefit from strong market positions, innovation and economies of scale. Furthermore, strong profitability usually translates very well into cash flow, which gives a lot of flexibility with capital allocation \u2013 the companies can either reinvest in growth during favorable times or support the stock price through repurchases when the market is less favorable. Consequently, the advantages of investing in such companies include stability, the potential for consistent revenue growth, and resilience during economic downturns.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other most profitable large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe that the most profitable companies can enter the spotlight again at a time when the US and global economy are at an important crossroads. Not only are these companies immune to tariffs and less sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, and consumer health, but they also generate tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every year, which gives them flexibility to adjust to a new regime. Investor sentiment has shifted to a pronounced bearish, as the US stock market officially entered correction mode, with more than a 10% contraction since the February peak. It appears that the fears of Trump tariffs staying for the long-term, as well as the negative impact on GDP growth from major cuts in public funding, are finally hitting the markets. Going forward, as smaller-cap stocks are pressured by uncertainty and deteriorating consumer confidence, profitable large caps can become safe havens and attract capital. The key takeaway for investors is that if one wants to stay invested in the US equity market amid the current turbulent times, they\u2019re better off sticking to the widest moat and most profitable names out there.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of most profitable large cap stocks, we searched for the publicly traded companies with the largest amount of net income generated in the latest financial year and ranked them accordingly. For each company we also include the number of hedge funds that own the stock, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) the Most Profitable Large Cap Stock to Buy Now?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nLast year net income: $33.68 billion\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a multinational energy company engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of oil, natural gas, and petrochemical products.

On the operational side, XOM achieved record results in its Product Solutions division and reduced methane intensity by more than 60% since 2016. In the Permian Basin, the company set a production record from both Heritage ExxonMobil and Pioneer assets, with output projected to rise from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the close of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030.

By the end of the decade, XOM anticipates an additional $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow, while continuing its commitment to sustainable, competitive, and growing shareholder returns.

            "content": "When the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro deploys the classic leftist narrative about the existence of global corporations \u2014 tributaries of \u201cimperialism\u201d that exploit people\u2019s resources \u2014 the verbal artillery is often reserved for a single oil company: ExxonMobil.\n\nThe energy multinational \u2014 the largest in the world \u2014 had a bitter, consequential confrontation with the Venezuelan government more than 10 years ago. The enmity still resonates today.\n\nIn October 2014 \u2014 when Rafael Ram\u00edrez was president of PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company \u2014 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a body within the World Bank, ruled in favor of Exxon in a lawsuit against the Maduro government. The ruling required the Venezuelan state to pay $1.6 billion in compensation to this corporate giant for having nationalized its assets within the country.\n\nEmboldened by high oil prices and the multibillion-dollar national revenues during the 2006-2012 term, former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 who was elected in 1999 and governed until his death in 2013, when he was succeeded by Maduro \u2014 sought to shape his political project. With his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) \u2014 still the ruling party today \u2014 he carried out an aggressive wave of nationalizations of the country\u2019s productive structure. These expropriations had serious consequences for the national economy and a significant impact on the energy sector.\n\nThe new legal framework for oil \u2014 created by Ch\u00e1vez in 2005 \u2014 established the transition of existing operating agreements to the state-controlled joint venture model, guaranteeing PDVSA a majority stake in all activities related to the oil sector.\n\nForeign Minister Rafael Ram\u00edrez holds a press conference following the ruling in favor of Exxon Mobil regarding the nationalization of one of the firm\u2019s Venezuelan oil projects, in October of 2014, in Caracas. Ariana Cubillos (AP)\n\nPDVSA took control of the oil well operations and immediately experienced strong tensions with Exxon, which \u2014 unlike other companies \u2014 did not accept the new policy. Exxon claimed breach of contract. At that time, in 2012 \u2014 with the price of crude oil soaring to $100 a barrel and national revenue from oil revenues in the billions \u2014 PDVSA was still a powerful and operational company, despite its administrative turmoil.\n\nAfter the euphoria of the Chavista nationalizations, Venezuela has had to face costly lawsuits in international courts involving cases similar to the ones filed by Exxon\u2019s. These are companies demanding compensation for the seizure of their assets, which were confiscated in the name of national sovereignty by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his ministers between 2007 and 2013.\n\nBeginning in 2006, the Bolivarian Revolution repealed the structure of the Oil Opening Policy, which was designed during the late-1990s. This exploitation model encouraged massive investments by foreign companies \u2014 such as Chevron, Exxon, BP and Mitsubishi \u2014 that would operate alongside PDVSA (with very low royalties) for the first time since the nationalization of oil in 1976. This project significantly increased the production and export of Venezuelan crude oil and its derivatives. However, the Ch\u00e1vez administration considered the setup to be detrimental to national sovereignty.\n\nIn 2007, when the break with Exxon was finalized and the lawsuit in international courts ensued, the Venezuelan government launched an aggressive campaign against Exxon in the country. Billboards and television spots accused the conglomerate of being an enemy of national sovereignty, portraying it with all the trappings of classic Latin American leftist discourse.\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez visits oil workers on an Orinoco oil platform in August 2006. Anonymous (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\u201cExxonMobil is a company that\u2019s an enemy of Venezuela [...] and of the Venezuelan people,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Maduro recently declared. Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has accused the company of instigating the territorial conflict with Guyana and undermining the nation\u2019s rights to the oil-rich Essequibo region, which Caracas now claims. Maduro asserted that Exxon is acting \u201cout of revenge against the country,\u201d while pushing \u201ca persecution and extermination\u201d agenda against Chevron, the U.S. multinational allied with the Venezuelan government.\n\nAfter breaking with Venezuela, Exxon began business dealings with neighboring Guyana, a nation that has discovered significant offshore oil fields in areas it legally controls, but which Venezuela claims as its own. They\u2019re part of the Essequibo region, a territory that belonged to Venezuela and was colonized by the U.K. in the 19th century. Today, it\u2019s part of the jurisdiction of the modern-day Republic of Guyana.\n\nAs Venezuela sank into political unrest, economic chaos, legal uncertainty and corruption \u2014 causing its crude production to decline dramatically in recent years \u2014 Guyana worked rapidly with Exxon. Along with other corporations, the firm has brought the Starboek Block \u2014 120 miles offshore Guyana \u2014 into production very quickly, boosting Guyanese output. The country continues to attract capital to exploit these highly-endowed offshore wells.\n\nAfter holding a referendum on Venezuelan rights in the Essequibo region at the end of 2023, the Maduro administration has toughened its stance regarding this territory, even threatening prison sentences for anyone who questions Venezuelan rights to it. The Essequibo region comprises three-quarters of present-day Guyana.\n\nA man dressed as Uncle Sam holds an Exxon sign during a protest in favor of annexing the Essequibo region, in September 2023, in Caracas. Ariana Cubillos (AP)\n\nWith the rise in diplomatic tensions between Venezuela and Guyana, accusations from Caracas against Exxon have proliferated. The government claims that the conglomerate has been conspiring against Venezuela\u2019s interests and colluding with Guyana in the territorial dispute. \u201cIt was Exxon that moved to sanction Chevron, that\u2019s clear. That\u2019s how corporate pressures, lobbying, work,\u201d Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello stated this past week, supporting the statements of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and Delcy Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nAfter the Guyanese government publicly denounced the entry of a Venezuelan vessel into territorial waters it controls \u2014 although Venezuela claims it as its own \u2014 Cabello called a press conference and announced before the National Electoral Council that the local population will elect eight representatives from Guyana Essequibo in the upcoming Venezuela legislative elections in May.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition",

            "content": "The agreement entitles ExxonMobil's LNG marketing arm for Asia-Pacific to about 1.5 million MMtpa.\n\nARC Resources Ltd. said Tuesday it has entered into a deal to sell all of its offtake from the under-construction Cedar LNG in Canada to Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nThe agreement entitles ExxonMobil LNG Asia-Pacific to about 1.5 million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG). \u201cThe Agreement commences with commercial operations at the Cedar LNG Facility, expected late 2028, and continues for the term of ARC's liquefaction tolling services agreement with Cedar LNG Partners LP\u201d, Calgary, Canada-based ARC said in an online statement.\n\nUnder the tolling services agreement, ARC is to deliver around 200 million cubic feet a day of natural gas to Cedar LNG for liquefaction.\n\nCedar LNG, 50.1 percent owned by the Haisla Nation with Pembina Pipeline Corp. holding the remaining 49.9 percent, is planned to have a nameplate capacity of 3.3 MMtpa. It is located on tribal land on Canada\u2019s West Coast.\n\nThe project has secured all key governmental approvals and is in the early construction stage, Cedar LNG says on its website. The partners reached a final investment decision June 2024.\n\nARC president and chief executive Terry Anderson said of the agreement with ExxonMobil, \u201cToday, we have reached a significant milestone in our strategy to diversify and expand margins through participation in the global LNG market\u201d.\n\n\u201cThrough this Agreement, we have achieved our target of linking approximately 25 percent of our future natural gas production to international pricing\u201d, Anderson said.\n\nThis is ARC\u2019s third long-term LNG-related agreement in three years that provides exposure to international LNG pricing, the company said.\n\nIn 2022 it announced an agreement to supply 140,000 million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) of natural gas to Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Corpus Christi Stage III expansion with pricing linked to the Platts Japan Korea Marker.\n\nIn 2023 ARC announced a second agreement with Cheniere to supply 140,000 MMBtu to the SPL expansion project with pricing linked to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility.\n\nAndrew Barry, vice president for global LNG marketing at ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., said, \u201cThis Agreement provides ExxonMobil with advantaged access to Asian LNG markets by establishing ExxonMobil's first long-term offtake position on Canada's Pacific Coast\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with ARC Resources, one of Canada's largest and most experienced natural gas producers, as we continue to expand and diversify ExxonMobil's LNG portfolio and provide the lower-emissions energy the world needs\u201d, Barry added.\n\nExxonMobil itself has four LNG projects under development and expects to surpass 40 MMtpa of LNG sales by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe company expects to achieve first LNG sales from the Golden Pass development in the United States and from the Qatar North Field East expansion project near the end of 2025\u201d, ExxonMobil said December 11, 2024, announcing plans through to 2030. \u201cIt also is targeting final investment decisions at Papua New Guinea\u2019s Papua project in 2025 and at Mozambique\u2019s Rovuma development in 2026\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, and CSP Inc. CSPI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Exxon Mobil, Netflix and Alibaba\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Netflix, Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as well as a micro-cap stock CSP Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company's high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\n\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+41.8% vs. +38%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\n\n\n\nThe launch of a first-party ad tech platform in Canada and ones in the remaining ad countries in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year. Raised revenue guidance for 2025 between $43.5-$44.5 billion reflects improved business fundamentals.\n\n\n\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX's leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba's shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +18.1%). The company's Q3 fiscal 2025 results benefited from the monetization of Taobao and Tmall Group, cloud businesses and AI-integrated products. BABA is riding on strong momentum in its international commerce retail business, driven by strength in AliExpress' Choice.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business is a positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past year.\n\n\n\nHowever, non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 per ADS fell short of estimates, suggesting a complex growth narrative. Current market valuations, with the stock trading at multi-year highs, suggest limited immediate upside potential.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of CSP have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. -18.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $151.07 million is facing risks which include weak growth in the high-performance products segment, dependence on low-margin IT solutions and continued operating losses despite revenue growth.\n\n\n\nHigh stock-based compensation, customer concentration risks and limited international reach add uncertainty. Investors must weigh CSP's cybersecurity potential against its ongoing profitability challenges. Nevertheless, CSP is transitioning toward high-margin, recurring revenue streams, driven by strong service revenue growth and increased demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\n\n\n\nThe company's AZT PROTECT platform is gaining traction in critical infrastructure sectors, supported by key partnerships and a growing patent portfolio. A strong balance sheet with no long-term debt enables strategic investments, while its alliance with Rockwell Automation accelerates market expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against billionaire\u2019s other favorite oil and gas stocks.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a significant driver of the global economy, influencing industries, transportation, and geopolitical dynamics. However, the past year has been nothing short of a roller coaster for the sector, with high volatility coming from factors such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and a dampening demand due to a global economic slowdown.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now\n\nBrent crude prices have recently hit a 6-month low as US crude oil stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected build, coupled with worries about a looming return of more OPEC+ barrels to the market and President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. The global oil and gas majors have already struggled with decreasing prices in 2024 and the recent decline has only added to their troubles. Things could get even worse, as the IEA expects Brent crude prices to fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, as the US oil and gas production hits record highs, President Trump has made calls to \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d and pump those numbers up even higher, as he seeks to make the country self-sufficient in energy. However, not everyone seems to be on. Instead of continuously increasing supply and hence plunging prices even lower, the oil industry remains focused on achieving efficiency gains and maintaining capital discipline, while also rewarding loyal shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said of the natural gas sector. US gas producers, which curbed production last year due to multi-year low prices, are now adding gas rigs and boosting production as the price has crossed the $4.6 mark this week. The slowing output in 2024, a booming LNG industry, and fast-depleting inventories during the coldest winter in years have driven gas prices up by over 150% over the last year.\n\nAnother significant growth driver for America\u2019s natural gas industry is the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and the accompanying data centers, which consume 10 to 50 times the amount of energy per square foot of a typical commercial office building. These energy intensive facilities could consume as much as 9% of all energy generated in the US by 2030, and this energy needs to come from a relatively clean, flexible, and reliable source that is abundantly available in the form of natural gas. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by the end of the decade, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. Several gas majors are now even bypassing traditional utilities and building power plants to connect directly to data centers, a move that could reshape the industry in the years to come, if it pays off.",

            "content": "We believe the broad stock market is currently at a crossroads and has just entered a new \u201cTrump 2.0 regime,\u201d which will be dominated by unprecedented actions and measures. Not only does the new US administration employ tools such as tariffs that were not used on a large scale for decades, but it has also started some strategic political shifts that could threaten decade-long alliances (such as the US-Europe alliance). All of this, coupled with aggressive cost-cutting in federal budgets and spending, has introduced a lot of uncertainty and difficult-to-digest news for investors.\n\nMarket volatility, geopolitical tensions, and changes in monetary policy can also drive investors toward safer investments to protect their capital. Understanding and managing risk, particularly through measures like equity beta, allows investors to navigate uncertain times without exposing themselves to unnecessary losses. While low beta stocks are usually more mature and low growth businesses, they can deliver strong returns during bear markets, as capital actively starts flowing into them and inflates their market valuation. Consequently, by rotating into low risk stocks at the right time, investors can achieve two goals at once \u2013 not only reduce the risk of the portfolio, but also significantly improve the potential return profile.\n\nThere are times when the risk profile of a portfolio becomes a more important consideration than maximizing returns, such as during periods of economic uncertainty, market downturns, or when an investor nears retirement and prioritizes capital preservation over growth. In these situations, investors often shift their focus from aggressive returns, such as growth stocks, to minimizing potential losses, adjusting their portfolios to include more low-beta stocks, bonds, or other defensive assets.\n\nRisk is a key consideration in investing and portfolio management, as investors generally aim to achieve the maximum return per minimum unit of risk. The true risk of a stock is impossible to measure or quantify, but there are several metrics, such as the volatility of returns or equity beta, that can gauge the magnitude of risk relative to other companies. The equity beta of a stock represents the sensitivity, or correlation, between the returns of the stock and the returns of the broad market. An equity beta below one means that the stock does not respond as much as the broad market to different events, such as macroeconomic developments, monetary policy changes, etc. When a stock with low risk (low beta) is introduced into a portfolio, the overall expected risk of the portfolio is significantly reduced, while the expected return is usually not significantly compromised, leading to a better risk/return profile.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other low risk stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe US stock market is also in correction mode since the inauguration date, and there is no certainty about when this will stop. With many surveys showing deteriorating spending and business outlooks, a slowdown in GDP growth with a potential bear market becomes a probable scenario for the following quarters. These are the times when buying low risk stocks could significantly improve the risk profile of one\u2019s portfolio without compromising the potential return. Low risk stocks, as gauged by the equity beta, are usually found in sectors like consumer defensive, healthcare, as well as some financials and energy, which tend to have more predictable and stable business models. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best low risk stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of low risk stocks, we used Finviz to filter the companies that have an equity beta below 1.0x. Then we compared them with Insider Monkey's proprietary Q4 2024 database of hedge funds ownership and included in the article the top 10 names with the highest number of hedge funds that own the stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nEquity Beta: 0.63x\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global energy company engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of oil, natural gas, and petrochemical products. It operates through three main segments: Upstream, which focuses on oil and gas exploration and production; Downstream, which includes refining and fuel marketing; and Chemical, which produces petrochemicals used in industrial and consumer products. XOM has operations in multiple regions, supplying energy to transportation, industrial, and residential markets, and invests in carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels as part of its long-term energy transition strategy while maintaining a focus on operational efficiency and resource development. The Texas-based company ranked first on our recent list of 11 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) delivered strong financial results in 2024, achieving earnings of $34 billion, their third highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. The company generated cash flow from operations of $55 billion and delivered a return on capital employed of 13%, with their 5-year average ROCE being an industry-leading 11%. Operationally, the company achieved record performance in their Product Solutions business and reduced methane intensity by more than 60% since 2016. In the Permian Basin, XOM achieved record production from both Heritage ExxonMobil assets and Pioneer assets, projecting production growth from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030. In Guyana, the company reached record production of 650,000 barrels per day in just 10 years from discovery.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) plans to bring online several major projects expected to deliver more than $3 billion in earnings potential in 2026. The company's long-term outlook includes plans to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio with 60% of Upstream production from advantaged assets by 2030, achieve 80% growth in high-value product sales, and take an additional $6 billion in cost out of the business. Compared to other IOCs over the last 5 years, XOM has grown cash flow from operations at roughly 15% compounded annual growth rate, more than double the closest competitor, and distributed more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), as well as a micro-cap stock CSP Inc. (CSPI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\n\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\n\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Melting Away Early-Morning Gains\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\n\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+6.7% vs. +5.4%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\n\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+41.8% vs. +38%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\n\n\n\nThe launch of a first-party ad tech platform in Canada and ones in the remaining ad countries in 2025 signals Netflix's commitment to maximizing this new revenue stream, with ad revenues expected to roughly double year-over-year. Raised revenue guidance for 2025 between $43.5-$44.5 billion reflects improved business fundamentals.\n\n\n\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX\u2019s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\n\n\n\nAlibaba\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+78.1% vs. +18.1%). The company\u2019s Q3 fiscal 2025 results benefited from the monetization of Taobao and Tmall Group, cloud businesses and AI-integrated products. BABA is riding on strong momentum in its international commerce retail business, driven by strength in AliExpress\u2019 Choice.\n\n\n\nGrowing international commerce wholesale business, thanks to strength in cross-border-related value-added services, is a tailwind. Expanding China's wholesale commerce business is a positive. Robust local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services are further driving top-line growth. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past year.\n\n\n\nHowever, non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 per ADS fell short of estimates, suggesting a complex growth narrative. Current market valuations, with the stock trading at multi-year highs, suggest limited immediate upside potential.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of CSP have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (-23.5% vs. -18.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $151.07 million is facing risks which include weak growth in the high-performance products segment, dependence on low-margin IT solutions and continued operating losses despite revenue growth.\n\n\n\nHigh stock-based compensation, customer concentration risks and limited international reach add uncertainty. Investors must weigh CSP\u2019s cybersecurity potential against its ongoing profitability challenges. Nevertheless, CSP is transitioning toward high-margin, recurring revenue streams, driven by strong service revenue growth and increased demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s AZT PROTECT platform is gaining traction in critical infrastructure sectors, supported by key partnerships and a growing patent portfolio. A strong balance sheet with no long-term debt enables strategic investments, while its alliance with Rockwell Automation accelerates market expansion.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Discover Financial Services (DFS), Veeva Systems Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this oil and natural gas company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, to which Exxon belongs, has lost 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Exxon is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, indicating a change of -16.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.9%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.90 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Exxon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Exxon.",

            "content": "Hickey weighed in on the uncertainty dominating markets, emphasizing that no one can predict the full impact of tariffs. He referenced Target CEO Brian Cornell\u2019s comments earlier in the day about the lack of certainty regarding tariffs, taxes, rates, and the economy. Hickey remarked that this stew of uncertainty is keeping investors cautious. He noted that intraday rallies, such as the one seen earlier in the day after bouncing off the 200-day moving average, are often short-lived due to unpredictable policy developments. For instance, Trump\u2019s speeches have recently been followed by market declines, adding to investor hesitancy. He also highlighted historical context for pullbacks like the current one: since World War II, there have been 64 instances of a 5% drop from all-time highs in the S&P 500. While not uncommon, he advised caution in the short term due to unpredictable market reactions.\n\nCamporeale highlighted the difficulty of navigating the rapid pace of headlines surrounding trade discussions out of Washington. Entering the year with a 10% equity overweight, JP Morgan has since reduced this to 5%, reallocating some exposure to US, developed non-US, and emerging markets. Camporeale noted that while policy uncertainty raises questions about growth and earnings outlooks, the US economy remains strong, with a 4% unemployment rate, 3% GDP growth, and solid corporate balance sheets. He said that despite short-term market turbulence, recession risks remain low, and their portfolio maintains an equity overweight alongside high-yield exposure. He also pointed out that it is still early in President Trump's second term and too soon to draw definitive conclusions about its impact. He believes that lower interest rates could pave the way for positive fiscal and deregulation policies that have yet to fully materialize. Despite current market fears, he remains optimistic about the economy\u2019s strength and low recession probability.\n\nOn a down day for major market averages, Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, and Phil Camporeale, portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, discussed the ongoing volatility. They both appeared on CNBC's 'Closing Bell Overtime' on March 5 to talk about how tariff policy raises uncertainty around growth and earnings outlook.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Undervalued US Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other undervalued US stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBoth experts agreed that uncertainty around tariffs and other policies will continue influencing market behavior in the near term. However, they emphasized different aspects, Camporeale focused on economic strength and strategic positioning within portfolios, while Hickey stressed caution amid ongoing unpredictability in policy-driven market movements.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top US stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 6: 13.46\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a global energy and petrochemical company that explores, produces, and refines crude oil and natural gas. It also manufactures and markets energy, chemical, and specialty products under the iconic Exxon, Esso, and Mobil brands, while pursuing lower-emission technologies.\n\nThe company's Upstream segment involves the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. In 2024, it achieved record production from advantaged assets and the highest liquid production in over 40 years. This was driven by strength in the Permian and Guyana. In the Permian, combined production from Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Pioneer assets will reach 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030, which is up from 1.5 million in 2024. Guyana production reached 650,000 barrels per day in just 10 years, and tripled local GDP per capita since 2020.\n\nIn 2025, projects like Yellowtail in Guyana and advanced Permian recovery techniques will be implemented. These focus on low-cost, low-emission and high-return growth. Yellowtail is the company's fourth and largest deepwater oil development project in Guyana, for increasing production capacity. Advanced Permian recovery techniques refer to improved methods used by Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the Permian Basin to extract more oil and gas.\n\nMadison Dividend Income Fund views Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) positively due to its strategic assets, efficient operations, planned production growth, and strong shareholder return policy, even with moderate oil prices. Here's what it stated in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThis quarter we are highlighting Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) as a relative yield example in the Energy sector. XOM is a leading integrated oil and natural gas company. It has upstream assets that develop and produce oil and natural gas, along with downstream refining and chemical manufacturing assets. We believe it has attractive low-cost acreage in the Permian basin and has a sizeable growth opportunity in Guyana. Further, we think XOM has a sustainable competitive advantage due to size and scale, and its ability to integrate refining and chemical assets provides a low-cost advantage versus competitors.\n\nOverall XOM ranks 2nd on our list of the most undervalued US stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM and Guyana's government are set to begin discussions over a tax dispute involving $214 million in expenses registered by the U.S. oil giant. The country's Natural Resources Ministry has instructed the tax agency to initiate the resolution process after an audit flagged the costs as potentially overstated.\n\nXOM's Cost Recovery Under Scrutiny\n\nExxonMobil leads a consortium operating the massive Stabroek offshore block, where expenses are tightly monitored due to the cost oil mechanism. The arrangement allows ExxonMobil and its partners to claim up to 75% of production for cost recovery, while Guyana receives half of the remaining crude. The government ensures these expenses are audited to confirm compliance with contractual terms.\n\nAudit Finds Discrepancies in XOM's Expenses\n\nThe dispute followed a review by U.S.-based IHS Markit, which audited ExxonMobil's reported costs from 1999 to 2017. Guyana's tax authority accepted IHS Markit's recommendation to adjust XOM\u2019s cost bank by $214.4 million, reaffirming its stance that these costs should not be reimbursed through oil revenues. ExxonMobil was officially notified of this position, though the company has not publicly responded.\n\nOngoing Review of XOM\u2019s Recent Expenses\n\nExxonMobil has already recovered $33.9 billion of the $41.1 billion spent in Guyana, according to vice president Bharrat Jagdeo. Meanwhile, a second audit covering 2018-2020, conducted by VHE Consulting, is ongoing. ExxonMobil has responded to preliminary findings, and VHE is currently reviewing them.\n\nThe outcome of these discussions could have significant implications for ExxonMobil\u2019s cost recovery structure and its long-term financial relationship with Guyana.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nCurrently, XOM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like Antero Resources Corporation AR, NextDecade Corporation NEXT and EOG Resources, Inc.

Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exxon Mobil is:\n\n13% = US$35b \u00f7 US$271b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nExxon Mobil's Earnings Growth And 13% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Exxon Mobil seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. This certainly adds some context to Exxon Mobil's exceptional 36% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Exxon Mobil's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 39% in the same 5-year period.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for XOM? You can find out in\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nExxon Mobil's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 41%, meaning the company retains 59% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Exxon Mobil is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.\n\nMoreover, Exxon Mobil is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 45%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 15%.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Exxon Mobil's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Companies that Just Raised their Dividends\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nAnalysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 13.46\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies in the US. The company\u2019s operations are appealing because they span the entire oil and gas supply chain, covering exploration and production, transportation, and the refining of crude oil into products such as gasoline, diesel, and petrochemicals. This diversified structure provides stability in the often unpredictable energy market. When oil prices are high, the exploration and production segments thrive, while during periods of lower prices, the transportation and refining divisions help offset the impact of market fluctuations.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported revenue of $83.4 billion, representing a slight 1.1% decline compared to the previous year. Since 2019, the company has achieved $12.1 billion in structural cost savings, outperforming its industry peers while helping to mitigate inflationary pressures and expansion costs. For the full year, the company posted the highest return on capital employed in its sector at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share, offering a yield of 3.68%, as of March 6. The company delivered strong financial results in 2024, generating $55 billion in free cash flow\u2014the third-highest figure in the past decade. Total free cash flow for the year stood at $36.2 billion, with $16.7 billion returned to shareholders through dividends. Exxon remains committed to its $20 billion annual share repurchase program, which is set to continue through 2026, while maintaining a 42-year streak of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This position remains unchanged and clear, and Exxon was so advised,\u201d the ministry said in a release.\n\nExxon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBy the end of January, the Exxon-led consortium, which controls all oil and gas output in Guyana, had recovered $33.9 billion of the $41.1 billion spent in the area, the country\u2019s Vice President, Bharrat Jagdeo, told Reuters last week.\n\nA second audit ordered by the government to firm VHE Consulting covering expenses from 2018 to 2020 is still ongoing, the ministry said, adding that Exxon replied on its initial findings and VHE is now reviewing the response.\n\nThe Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corp XOM shares are trading lower by 6.5% to $104.39 since Monday\u2019s open. The decline this week comes as crude oil prices slump to a six-month low following a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories, raising concerns about weakening demand.\n\nWhat To Know: As the largest U.S. oil major, Exxon relies heavily on strong crude prices to drive its upstream earnings. Lower oil prices directly impact its production revenues, reducing cash flow that funds dividends and capital expenditures.\n\nAdditionally, Exxon's refining and chemical businesses, which typically act as a hedge against oil price declines, could also fall under pressure due to weaker margins and softening global demand.\n\nRead Also: European Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates Marking Sixth Cut In 9 Months\n\nOPEC+'s decision to move forward with its planned April rollback of production cuts has added further uncertainty, fueling concerns about an oversupplied market. Exxon has focused on expanding production in key regions like the Permian Basin and Guyana, but lower crude prices could challenge profitability in these areas.\n\nWith macroeconomic headwinds, market volatility and oil prices under pressure, Exxon faces increasing challenges to maintain earnings growth, prompting today's stock decline to a fresh yearly low.

An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, XOM has a 52-week high of $126.34 and a 52-week low of $103.67.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM and QatarEnergy\u2019s $10 billion Golden Pass LNG project in Texas has received a crucial export extension from the U.S. Department of Energy. The new approval extends the deadline to begin exports from Sept. 30, 2024, to March 31, 2027, providing additional time to complete construction and commence operations.\n\nOnce operational, Golden Pass will be the ninth-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in the United States, with a daily export capacity of 2.57 billion cubic feet of LNG. The facility is expected to begin production in late 2025, with exports commencing shortly thereafter.\n\nThe extension followed a broader U.S. policy shift on LNG exports. While the Biden administration recently paused new LNG export approvals to assess economic and environmental impacts, this decision does not affect previously sanctioned projects like Golden Pass. Initially approved for exports to non-free trade agreement countries under the Trump administration, the project remains a key part of ExxonMobil\u2019s long-term LNG growth strategy.\n\nGolden Pass' developers requested a three-year construction extension last August, citing contractor changes that could delay full completion until November 2029. A company spokesperson emphasized that the extension provides necessary contingency time to address uncertainties inherent in large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nWith QatarEnergy holding a 70% stake and ExxonMobil owning the remaining 30%, Golden Pass represents a crucial asset for ExxonMobil\u2019s expanding LNG portfolio. The project is strategically positioned to serve growing energy demand in Asia and Europe, reinforcing the company\u2019s role in the global LNG market.\n\nAs the United States maintains its position as the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter, ExxonMobil\u2019s Golden Pass project is set to play a significant role in meeting future energy needs despite ongoing regulatory and logistical challenges.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nCurrently, XOM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like Antero Resources Corporation AR, NextDecade Corporation NEXT and EOG Resources, Inc. EOG. While Antero Resources presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NextDecade and EOG Resources carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAntero Resources, one of the fastest-growing natural gas producers in the United States, boasts a strategic acreage position in the low-risk properties of the Appalachian Basin. The company has more than two decades of premium low-cost drilling inventory in the prolific basin, securing a strong production outlook. AR is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for LNG, both in the United States and globally.",

Shares of energy and petroleum stocks are trading lower as oil prices drop after US inventories rose by 3.6 million barrels.\n\nAdditionally, trade concerns and OPEC+\u2019s recent decision to move forward with its planned April wind-down of production cuts added further pressure. The commodity is currently trading at a 6-month low.\n\nRead Also: US Services Sector Unexpectedly Expands In February Despite Slowing Job Growth\n\nWhy This Matters: As one of the largest integrated oil and gas companies, Exxon is particularly vulnerable to falling crude prices, which directly impact its upstream profits from oil production. Lower prices also squeeze refining margins, making it more difficult for Exxon to offset losses with its downstream operations.\n\nAdditionally, OPEC+'s decision to move forward with its planned April rollback of production cuts has heightened concerns about a potential supply glut, exacerbating downward pressure on oil markets.\n\nBeyond industry-specific challenges, broader economic concerns and trade uncertainties are dampening sentiment toward Exxon and the energy sector as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE struggling to find support, Exxon's stock remains under pressure in 2025, prompting Wednesday\u2019s drop to a fresh 52-week low.\n\nRead Also: Wall Street Awaits Trump\u2019s Tariff Decision, Digests Mixed Economic Data: What\u2019s Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nHow To Buy XOM Stock\n\nBesides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share \u2013 or fractional share \u2013 of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument.\n\nFor example, in Exxon Mobil\u2019s case, it is in the Energy sector.

Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

James Durbin/The Oilfield Photographer, Inc.\n\nA week of low to no water pressure and calls for conservation as the city of Midland deals with a valve failure has highlighted the need for water planning and system redundancy.\n\n\u201cIn my five years in leadership, I\u2019ve learned that he who has the water makes the rules,\u201d said Midland Mayor Lori Blong. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have water, you have much bigger problems.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAddressing the first day of the Permian Basin Water in Energy Conference, the mayor noted that those in the room \u201care sitting on an ocean of water if we can treat it properly.\u201d\n\nIt will require industry, academia and investors to come together to develop the technology and build infrastructure that is scalable to build a resilient water supply that can meet future needs, she said. But water concerns are not limited to just Midland or to West Texas, but the state, she pointed out.\n\nBlong said everyone in the audience can play a key role.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have an oil and gas industry without water management,\u201d she said. \u201c(Your) technology and leadership can secure water for the future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWater is an essential resource for the world\u2019s ecosystem, for humans and for all life, said Dennis Lithgow, water infrastructure manager at ExxonMobil, the title sponsor of the conference.\n\nOpening the conference, Lithgow detailed his company\u2019s work in understanding the impact of its operations on the environment and crafting sustainable water solutions for its Permian Basin operations. That includes using 96% non-freshwater, utilizing recycled, reclaimed or brackish water instead.\n\nSince 2020, he estimated ExxonMobil has used 1.3 billion barrels of recycled produced water, the equivalent of 2.5 years of municipal water used by Midland and Ector counties combined. The company is also conducting or participating in piloting technological advances, including in desalination and 13 beneficial reuse pilot projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough road, and we\u2019ve put in a lot of hard work,\u201d Lithgow said. \u201cWe look forward to our first commercial scale desalination plant in 2026.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWater reuse can provide economic benefits by reducing the cost of disposal and also play a critical role in reducing water scarcity,\u201d he stated. \u201cProduced water is not just a byproduct, it is a source that can contribute to more sustainable and efficient operations.\u201d\n\nLithgow said the company is also working with regulators to address seismicity induced by water injection, supporting efforts to mitigate or reduce seismic events.\n\nHe concluded his presentation by challenging attendees to meet someone they don\u2019t know and make contacts. Doing so will help build a network that will let the industry play its part in finding solutions.",

Previously, Golden Pass was required under its license to start up by Nov. 30, 2026.\n\nThe move comes as Energy Secretary Chris Wright vowed to approve LNG export projects that have languished in some cases for years. The agency announced last month conditional approval to Commonwealth LNG to ship millions of tons of the fuel a year from a planned facility near Cameron, La.\n\n\u201cExporting U.S. LNG supports American jobs, bolsters our national security and strengthens America\u2019s position as a world energy leader,\u201d Wright said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump has pledged to restore energy dominance for the American people, and I am proud to help deliver on that agenda with today\u2019s permit extension.\u201d\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nThe approvals come after President Donald Trump lifted a moratorium put in place by the Biden administration on the approval of new permits to sell LNG abroad, put in place after opposition from activists who say the approvals lock in decades of global warming causing emissions.\n\nOther companies awaiting Energy Department approval for export projects include Venture Global Inc. and Energy Transfer LP.

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.22%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.55%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.35%.\n\nShares of the oil and natural gas company witnessed a gain of 0.63% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Oils-Energy sector with its loss of 3.38% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.31%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Exxon Mobil in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Exxon Mobil to post earnings of $1.72 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 16.5%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $85.78 billion, up 3.24% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $7.41 per share and revenue of $347.36 billion, indicating changes of -4.88% and -0.64%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Exxon Mobil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.57% lower. At present, Exxon Mobil boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Exxon Mobil has a Forward P/E ratio of 14.55 right now. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 7.69 for its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, XOM's PEG ratio is currently 2.91. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Integrated - International was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 at yesterday's closing price.",

            "content": "Analysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWe recently published a list of 25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) the Best Dividend Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 16\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 3.63%\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks eleventh on our list of the best dividend stocks according to billionaires. The company continues to strengthen its financial position by refining its portfolio and effectively managing capital expenditures through technology-driven efficiencies and a well-structured project organization. With its vast resources, advanced technological capabilities, and global presence, the company is well-positioned to seize emerging opportunities in carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and hydrogen production. These initiatives not only help diversify its revenue streams but also reduce risks associated with the energy transition while creating new growth prospects aligned with broader decarbonization efforts.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported $83.4 billion in revenue, reflecting a 1.1% year-over-year decline. Since 2019, the company has achieved $12.1 billion in structural cost savings, outperforming industry peers and helping offset inflationary pressures and expansion costs. For the full year, it delivered the highest return on capital employed in its sector at 12.7%, with a five-year average of 10.8%.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.63%, as of March 3. It posted strong financial results in fiscal 2024, generating $55 billion in free cash flow\u2014the third-highest in the past decade. Total free cash flow for the year stood at $36.2 billion, while $16.7 billion was distributed to shareholders through dividends. The company remains committed to its $20 billion annual share repurchase program, which is set to continue through 2026. In addition, it has upheld a 42-year track record of consecutive dividend increases.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 11th on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "On June 24, 2024, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres launched the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity. In so doing, Guterres highlighted the climate crisis as a particular area of concern, stating, \u201cCoordinated disinformation campaigns are seeking to undermine climate action.\u201d He urged advertisers and public relations practitioners to refrain from greenwashing and to avoid clients that are \u201cmisleading people and destroying our planet\u201d1. Yet, sustained disinformation campaigns \u2013 intentionally inaccurate content designed to mislead2 \u2013 on social media in Brazil, for example, have been criticized for being \u201crampant,\u201d \u201cardent,\u201d and \u201ctroubling\u201d for condoning, and then perpetuating, renewed deforestation of the Amazon rainforest3,4. Disinformation has also included patently false conspiracy theories such as Chemtrails \u2013 the notion that condensation trails left in the sky by aircraft consist of chemical agents sprayed for nefarious purposes \u2013 which up to 40% of Americans believe as \u201csomewhat true,\u201d thereby influencing public attitudes about climate policy and geoengineering5. As one study concluded when noting these trends, \u201cdisinformation represents one of the major obstacles to meaningful actions against climate change skepticism.\u201d6\n\nCoordinated disinformation campaigns about climate change have pernicious and long-lasting negative impacts on sustainability patterns or beliefs about climate change. The effects of climate disinformation include increasing political polarization and/or political inaction and slowing down or even rejecting climate policies, making how one responds to and communicates about climate action a deeply political process7,8,9,10. Such effects can be countered by selecting the right communication tools when operating in an adversarial environment such as using well-designed forewarning messages to counter disinformation11. This study specifically focuses on disclosure messages and contextualized inoculation strategies to counter clean energy transition disinformation campaigns by big oil companies.\n\nDisinformation campaigns often reflect the intent of well-funded vested interest groups that benefit from marginalizing environmental issues such as climate change12,13. Recently published archival research suggests that the American Petroleum Institute was \u201cpromulgating false and misleading information about climate change\u201d as early as 198014. Internal projections created by ExxonMobil starting in the late 1970s and 1980s on the impact of fossil fuels on climate change were very accurate, even surpassing those of some academic and governmental scientists; yet the firm continued to actively manufacture doubt about the certainty of climate science15. Moreover, since the 1970s, when mainstream news organizations such as the New York Times and the Washington Post launched their paid editorials \u2013 or advertorials \u2013 they have been instrumental to fossil fuel companies in helping to shape how the public and policy makers perceive the oil industry and its contributions to society16,17. This has a downstream effect towards potential greenwashing where the entire information ecosystem can be manipulated to convey a specific narrative. For example, a recent study found that big oil firms engage in redirecting and reframing social media communications on climate and sustainability when nudged by intergovernmental and non-governmental stakeholders18. Similarly, another study found that fossil firms\u2019 investment portfolios frequently do not match their climate and clean energy discourse which is often linked to greenwashing behavior19.\n\nIn this study, we contribute to a growing body of research into how to mitigate the potentially misleading effects of a covert type of advertising called native advertising20,21. While scholars have examined the effectiveness of disclosures (i.e., labels) that reveal to the consumer that the content they are reading/viewing is paid advertising, thereby increasing consumers\u2019 understanding of the content\u2019s origins, native advertising by fossil fuel companies, or about climate change, has not yet received scholarly attention. Another line of scholarship draws on inoculation theory22 to advance the idea of forewarning messages \u2013 or prebunking23,24 \u2013 to warn the consumer about potential exposure to paid content that may be misleading. In the present study, we investigate the impacts these two mitigation strategies, i.e., disclosure and forewarning messages, have on reducing people\u2019s misperceptions after exposure to a native advertising post from the fossil fuel industry. We term our study the \u201cFuture of Energy\u201d for two reasons. Firstly, it refers to a real-world advertising campaign sponsored by ExxonMobil, one on which we based our online experiment. Secondly, however, is its double meaning as a new technique energy companies use to manipulate mass public opinion, in this case relying on misinformation to shape social attitudes, one that we worry could also become common in the future strategies of firms and other actors intent on misleading the public.\n\nIn the last fifteen years, news organizations have developed a digital version of advertorials\u2014native advertising\u2014to offer to advertisers. These have been adopted by the fossil fuel industry, among others, to influence public attitudes about their businesses. Native advertising refers to paid content that is created and published, mostly online, by an assortment of news media, from legacy outlets such as the New York Times and the Washington Post to internet era companies like Politico and Huffington Post. What distinguishes native advertising from traditional advertising is its deliberate design\u2014with visual cues of format, font, headings, and masthead\u2014that mimics the news organization\u2019s own journalistic reporting and other content. Whereas the advertorials of the analog era were created by public relations and advertising agencies and then disseminated by news outlets, today many news organizations operate their own in-house content studios, separate from their newsrooms, to create native advertising on behalf of corporate and other paying clients. These in-house content studios perform all the functions of a traditional advertising agency but from within the confines of the news organization itself. Thus, native advertising enables news outlets to generate revenue not only from the distribution of a client\u2019s message, but also from creating the message in a way that mimics its reporting25.\n\nAlthough the incremental revenue generated by native advertising is sorely needed at a time when the journalism industry has suffered financially from technological evolutions in the media environment, many critics have raised concerns about negative effects of native ads. For example, even though the US Federal Trade Commission requires disclosures that clearly and conspicuously distinguish native advertising from news articles, academic research has repeatedly shown that most media consumers do not notice the disclosures or do not understand what they mean and are therefore often deceived by the content, believing it to be news25,26,27. Studies have also demonstrated that the disclosures, more often than not, disappear when native advertising is posted on social media, making it seem like a journalistic article is being shared rather than commercial content28,29. Moreover, other evidence reveals that the claims in native advertising created by a news outlet can sometimes contradict the reporting coming from the newsroom30.\n\nThus, the fossil fuel industry\u2019s history of deceptive communications, combined with the nebulous properties and negative effects of native advertising, give good reasons for concern that companies may use native ads to further fuel climate skepticism and delay climate action. In other words, we are concerned that native advertising may be a potent form of disinformation\u2014one living at the heart of our fact-based communication system: the mainstream news media.\n\nEfforts to reduce the harms of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s disinformation campaigns exist among numerous research programs into how to mitigate false and misleading content in a digital and polluted information environment. A growing body of evidence has emerged examining the extent to which interventions can succeed in refuting disinformation. Given that disinformation is often \u201csticky\u201d and difficult to correct, best practices call for preemptive interventions31. Premised on inoculation theory, these \u201cpre-bunking\u201d interventions build up psychological immunity against attempts at influence in a way analogous to immunization against biological pathogens32. However, rather than injecting a weakened virus, people are exposed to a weakened message designed to promote immunity against forthcoming influence attempts33. For instance, forewarnings about the strategic use of native advertising have significantly decreased the likelihood that people are deceived by it20,34.\n\nAlthough some recent research has raised doubt about the effectiveness of inoculation strategies35, the preponderance of evidence over the decades has shown that prebunking is widely effective across a variety of topics \u2013 including climate disinformation \u2013 and across varying cultures36,37,38. Yet, despite the promise of inoculation messages, studies have noted that their effects decay over time and therefore require reinforcement messaging39. There is also conflicting evidence about the scalability of inoculation messages. While some studies indicate messages are scalable on social media40 and can even be contagious, spreading between individuals28, other research suggests motivational obstacles hinder widespread acceptance of inoculation messages41. Moreover, some studies indicate that although inoculation messages reduce belief in disinformation, they may also make people skeptical of all evidence including true information42. Given that previous studies have found resistance to misinformation can be induced by cognitively inoculating individuals against doubt-sowing about climate change43,44, we look to extend this research to energy-related disinformation specifically being spread by ExxonMobil. In particular, the present study aims to test the effects of native advertising disclosures and prebunking messages in building cognitive resilience to disinformation efforts, such as The Future of Energy ad.\n\nThe above sections have noted the large trove of evidence that has accrued regarding the false and misleading communications from the fossil fuel industry; the body of work documenting native advertising and its misleading effects; and the research programs that have developed strategies for limiting the effects of misinformation among the public. The present study is the first to bring these three important strains of research together: to investigate how two mitigation strategies may reduce climate misperceptions caused by exposure to native advertising.\n\nRecent evidence reveals that big oil and gas firms like ExxonMobil had credible internal scientific knowledge on par with independent scientists and government institutions of the causes and consequences of climate change. While scientists worked to communicate what they knew about the impact of fossil fuel emissions on climate change, ExxonMobil acted to deny it\u2014including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, creating ignorance about the discernibility of anthropogenic warming through specific rhetoric, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a low-carbon world15. In the clean energy transition context, rhetorical instruments \u2013 like native advertisements \u2013 are being used to reframe and reiterate climate and sustainability communications from stakeholders that hold ExxonMobil accountable18, making it urgent to assess how native ads on behalf of big oil giants influence climate perceptions and how to design appropriate intervention strategies against this practice.\n\nOur experiment is designed around a real native ad, titled \u201cThe Future of Energy,\u201d which was sponsored by ExxonMobil and appeared on the New York Times website beginning in 2018. It was created by T Brand Studio, the Times\u2019 in-house design studio, as part of its \u201cUnexpected Energy\u201d campaign for which the news outlet was paid $5 million by ExxonMobil (Fig. 1)45. The ad is a classic native advertisement, with the Times\u2019 masthead logo prominently top and center, the \u201cpaid post\u201d disclosure below it, and ExxonMobil\u2019s (relatively small but red) logo in the top left. As the viewer scrolls through the webpage\u2019s high production-value visuals, they read not about ExxonMobil\u2019s oil pumping or refining, but algae ponds in Southern California, and Exxon\u2019s efforts to \u201ccreate the next generation of biofuels.\u201d The page is scattered with infographics representing algae, green technology and a healthy Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re working to decrease our overall carbon footprint,\u201d an Exxon researcher explains46.\n\nFig. 1 ExxonMobil\u2019s \u201cFuture of Energy\u201d misleading native advertisement created by the New York Times T-Brand Studio. Full size image\n\nTo explain the misleading nature of the ad, we turn to lawsuits brought against Exxon by multiple states that have cited the ad specifically as an example of misleading communications about climate change and Exxon\u2019s business practices. The Massachusetts lawsuit states, \u201cExxonMobil is running a series of paid full-page ads in print editions and posts in the electronic edition of The New York Times, produced with The New York Times\u2019 T Brand Studio, in which ExxonMobil misleadingly gushes about its efforts to develop energy production from alternate sources like algae and plant waste, efforts that pale in comparison to the investment ExxonMobil continues to make in fossil fuel production.\u201d47\n\nThen-Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey charged the ad with being \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and in violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Even where it was presumably accurate it was misleading: an algae researcher states, \u201cwe\u2019re aiming to have the technical ability to produce 10,000 barrels of algae-based biofuel a day by 2025.\u201d But even if this were true, \u201cthe ad does not mention that the goal only equates to 0.2 percent of the corporation\u2019s current refinery capacity, nor does it note Exxon\u2019s plans for fossil fuel production in the years to come.\u201d48 In the end, the project produced no fuel at all: in 2023 Exxon announced it was ending its investments in algae as a source of energy49. Yet as of this writing, the native ad is still accessible on the Times\u2019 website.",

In 2023, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro stoked tension by seeking a referendum on laying claim to a large part of Guyana.\n\n\u201cThe vessel is still in our waters,\u201d said Brigadier Omar Khan, head of the Guyana Defence Force, adding that \u201cfrom all indications, it is heading toward Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe US State Department called the threat by Venezuela unacceptable. \u201cFurther provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,\u201d the department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X, without elaborating.\n\nGuyana\u2019s president, Irfaan Ali, said the armed patrol ship transmitted a radio message informing the vessel that it was operating in disputed international waters before continuing its course to other vessels in the area.\n\n\u201cDuring this incursion, the Venezuelan vessel approached various assets in our exclusive waters, including FPSO Prosperity,\u201d Ali said, referring to one of the Exxon-contracted vessels.\n\nExxon discovered Stabroek in 2015. The territorial dispute, which dates back more than a century, flared up as Maduro sought to galvanize supporters for last year\u2019s presidential election, where he claimed victory in what observers called a stolen vote. Exxon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDelcy Rodriguez, Venezuela\u2019s vice president, lashed back at Ali, calling him \u201cthe Caribbean Zelensky\u201d in reference to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Rodriguez said in a statement that the waters are not part of Guyana but instead \u201ca maritime zone pending delimitation in accordance with international law\u201d.\n\nKhan said the Guyana Defence Force is monitoring the course of the vessel. It previously deployed aircraft over the area and sent a Coast Guard vessel to the area.\n\nAli told Bloomberg News he had informed lawmakers and was briefing Guyana\u2019s international partners, including the US.\n\nThe Organization of American States \u201cunequivocally condemns the recent actions of Venezuelan naval vessels\u201d threatening Exxon-operated production units in Guyana\u2019s waters, the OAS said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSuch acts of intimidation constitute a clear violation of international law, undermine regional stability, and threaten the principles of peaceful coexistence between nations,\u201d according to the OAS.\n\nAli said Venezuela\u2019s ambassador to Guyana has been summoned to a meeting and Guyana would send a formal protest to the Venezuelan government.\n\nThe Stabroek oil block is producing 650,000 barrels a day. It is also the seat of a significant gas discovery at Longtail with an estimated output of 1 to 1.2 billion cubic feet daily.\n\nIn 2023, Guyana\u2019s government provoked Maduro by saying it would award new oil blocks by the end of the year. The Maduro government said some of those blocks are in waters that have not been delimited, or belong to Venezuela, reigniting the border dispute.\n\nUS President Donald Trump this week said he plans to revoke Chevron Corp.\u2019s oil license to operate in Venezuela, threatening to torpedo the nation\u2019s slow economic recovery.\n\n\u201cVenezuela\u2019s development does not depend on the Americans,\u201d Maduro said Thursday, without referring to Chevron directly. \u201cWe don\u2019t kneel down to anyone.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best natural resources stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nNatural resource stocks are an important part of the global economy, representing mining, energy, and agricultural companies. These industries are the foundation of numerous sectors, providing necessary materials for infrastructure, technology, and transportation. Despite the growing emphasis on renewable energy, fossil fuels, metals, and agricultural resources remain essential for modern economies. According to The Business Research Company, the global mineral market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. This growth emphasizes the long-term importance of natural resources.\n\nThe top 40 global mining companies generated a record $943 billion in revenue in 2022, but this figure declined to approximately $792 billion in 2024, owing primarily to fluctuating commodity prices. Despite this, Deloitte reported that between January and mid-November 2024, the oil and gas industry paid out $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks, demonstrating the sector\u2019s strong cash returns.\n\nHowever, the natural resource sector has been experiencing a surge in market activity, driven mainly by commodity price movements and global demand. Precious metals, in particular, have proven to be strong assets. Over the past year, the market\u2019s Gold Index returned 44.59%, while the Silver Index returned 42.01%. These gains have resulted from rising investor interest in safe-haven assets due to inflationary pressures and escalating global trade tensions. As inflation erodes the value of fiat currencies, investors are increasingly turning to gold and silver as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, technological advancements such as Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platforms are increasing the efficiency of offshore gas production while reducing reliance on onshore infrastructure. According to Business Wire, global liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction capacity is expected to double by 2028 from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA as expansion projects continue. This projected increase indicates that even as the world strives for cleaner energy sources, natural gas will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix.\n\nWhile efforts to reduce global carbon emissions continue, natural resource companies are adjusting by balancing traditional operations with sustainability initiatives. For example, the UAE has pledged $30 billion to a global finance fund while its banking sector aims to invest $270 billion in green finance by 2030 to support renewable energy growth. Simultaneously, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, which manage $3.8 trillion in assets, are increasingly allocating capital to green investments. This shift has not only reduced fiscal breakeven burdens for energy companies but has also increased regional economic stability.\n\nThe chemicals industry is also shifting to sustainability, with renewable production of key chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, and olefins expected to cost between $440 billion and $1 trillion by 2040. According to PwC, this figure could rise to between $1.5 trillion and $3.3 trillion by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, innovative zinc recycling techniques have produced a 95% recovery rate from steel mill waste, converting industrial waste into useful recyclable components. Nanotechnology breakthroughs are increasing recovery efficiency in gold mining while reducing environmental impact. These technological advancements demonstrate the growing significance of technology in maximizing resource use and cutting waste, which propels the natural resource industry forward.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 Best Natural Resources Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds, we first conducted extensive research to identify companies with significant exposure to the natural resource sector. We defined exposure in terms of mining, energy production, agriculture, or the extraction and processing of key commodities. We then analyzed these companies based on their hedge fund holdings and ranked them based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nAs a prominent player in the global energy sector, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is extensively involved in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of gas, oil, and petrochemical products.

Exxon has demonstrated a long-standing commitment to providing value to its shareholders, maintaining its $20 billion annual buyback program and increasing dividends for 42 consecutive years.\n\nMoreover, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s expansion in the Permian Basin and Guyana is expected to improve its production prospects. With a projected Q3 2025 launch date, the Yellowtail project is expected to significantly increase the company\u2019s global output.

            "content": "Guyana has accused Venezuela of sending a naval patrol ship into its maritime territory and approaching an ExxonMobil oil production facility.\n\nThe incident took place on Saturday in the Stabroek Block, a major offshore oil-producing area in the Atlantic Ocean. Guyana has summoned Venezuela\u2019s ambassador and mobilised military assets in response.\n\nGuyanese President Irfaan Ali stated that a Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel was seen operating within Guyana\u2019s internationally recognised waters.\n\nThe patrol ship moved close to several oil production assets, including the Prosperity floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which produces around 222,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nThe FPSO is part of ExxonMobil\u2019s operations in the Stabroek Block, which is being developed in partnership with Hess Corporation and China\u2019s CNOOC.\n\nAfter the incident, Guyana deployed aircraft and coast guard patrols to monitor the situation and ensure the safety of oil infrastructure in the region.\n\nPresident Ali described the Venezuelan activity as a serious violation of Guyana\u2019s sovereignty.\n\n\u201cGuyana\u2019s maritime boundaries are recognised under international law, and this incursion is a matter of grave concern,\u201d he said in a televised statement.\n\nVenezuelan officials denied any wrongdoing, claiming that their naval operations took place in waters that remain under dispute.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez dismissed Guyana\u2019s accusations, calling them false. She also criticised ExxonMobil\u2019s presence in the area, referring to its operations as \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nA statement from the Venezuelan government rejected the claims, asserting that the waters in question are \u201cpending delimitation\u201d under international law. The government accused President Ali of misrepresenting the situation and defended the actions of its navy.\n\nGuyana has summoned Venezuela\u2019s ambassador in Georgetown to lodge a formal protest and has reported the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nSeveral International organisations and governments have supported Guyana. The U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs strongly condemned Venezuela\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cVenezuelan navy vessels threatening ExxonMobil\u2019s FPSO unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana\u2019s maritime territory. Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,\u201d the department said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe Organisation of American States (OAS) also criticised Venezuela\u2019s actions, stating that Guyana\u2019s territorial waters are internationally recognised.\n\nBoth countries are engaged in a long-running dispute over the oil-rich Essequibo region. Essequibo covers about 70% of Guyana\u2019s land and has been claimed by Venezuela for more than a century.\n\nThe dispute dates back to the late 1800s when an international boundary commission ruled in favour of Guyana (then British Guiana). Venezuela, however, has repeatedly contested this decision.\n\nTensions escalated in 2015 when ExxonMobil discovered large oil reserves offshore in the Stabroek Block. Since then, Venezuela has attempted to assert control over the region, issuing decrees and making territorial claims.\n\nIn January, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced plans to hold gubernatorial elections in Essequibo, despite an ICJ order from December 2023 that bans Venezuela from interfering in the region\u2019s governance until a final ruling is made. A decision from the ICJ is expected next year.\n\nReference: AP News\n\nMarine Insight Academy Online courses for the Maritime industry!

            "content": "Thus, for short-term ease, the U.S. may rely on Europe\u2019s demand, however, IEA predicts that the European gas demand will decline from 507 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 to somewhere between 281 and 407 bcm by 2035, owing to its transition to renewable energy sources. On the other hand, China\u2019s LNG demand is expected to grow and reach between 397 and 522 bcm by 2035.\n\nHowever, the industry is currently facing challenges in the form of the U.S.-China trade war, under which China imposed a 15% tariff on the U.S. LNG, as U.S. President Donald Trump put a 10% charge on Chinese imports. While long-term commitments are significant, in 2024, China\u2019s imports made up for only 5.5% (4.3 MT) of the total exports by the U.S., as per Kpler. It has been reported by Reuters that under 20-year agreements, Chinese buyers are to import 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from U.S. terminals. However, ongoing issues may curb further contracts.\n\nThis increased demand is driven by strong winters as well as supply-related issues from Russia. Previously, Europe imported LNG through Ukraine in 2024, while it is currently seeing increasing geopolitical issues. On the other hand, Asia\u2019s LNG demand has also seen growth, making up 34% of the total LNG exports made by the U.S. in 2024. Accordingly, shipments to Asia rose to 2.01 MT in December from 1.64 MT in November (up by 24%).\n\nIn contrast, the global market also has a major impact from Europe\u2019s LNG demand. The region\u2019s demand accounted for 55% of total LNG exports by the U.S. in 2024, according to LSEG. LNG shipments of 5.84 MT were sent to Europe by the U.S. in December 2024, which is up from 5.09 MT in the previous month.\n\nThe global market for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), with the support of secure energy and industrial demand, is looking at continued expansion. The industry is forecasted to grow from $143.35 billion in 2024 to $155.85 billion in 2025, according to The Business Research Company. This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. Looking further ahead, it is expected that the LNG market will reach $205.95 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.2%, which is predominantly attributed to the global demand for cleaner energy. The demand for LNG is majorly fulfilled by the U.S., exporting around 88.3 million metric tons (MT), which is up by 4.5% from 2023, according to LSEG.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoreover, advancements in technology in liquefaction and regasification have helped in improving energy efficiency and in reducing methane emissions across the supply chain. Furthermore, offshore gas extraction has been enabled by floating LNG (FLNG) with minimal onshore infrastructure, which adds to flexibility in production. The global LNG liquefaction capacity by 2028 is expected to increase from 473 million tons per annum (MTPA) in 2023 to 968 MTPA by 2028 with the help of new projects as per BusinessWire. The expansion will be led by North America, making up for 54% of the total capacity increase.\n\nLooking on to the other side, Australia also makes up for a key LNG player with over $126 billion invested in new and upcoming projects, as reported by Deloitte. These investments look to increase production capacity and help Australia secure long-term contracts amidst changing global demand.\n\nDespite these developments, natural gas futures prices have increased by around 98.02% in the past six months. This is an increase from $1.956 on August 26, 2024 to $4.23, as of writing this article. This reflects on the high volatility of the market as well as evolving trade flows.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we picked the top LNG companies having an exposure to LNG production and distribution. Furthermore, we made sure that we picked companies with strong market capitalization.

This decline was majorly attributable to lower refining margins and natural gas prices from its 2023 highs.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s weaker base volumes were cushioned by Guyana\u2019s and Permian Basin\u2019s strong volume growth and high-value product sales. Since 2019, the company also reported $12.1 billion in structural cost savings, strengthening its resilient financial position. Generating $55.0 billion in operating cash flow and $34.3 billion in free cash flow, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) supports its shareholder return program with $36.9 billion in dividends and share repurchases during the year.\n\nThe company holds a promising future with four top-tier LNG projects currently in development. This puts the company on track to achieve over 40 million metric tons per annum of LNG sales by the year 2030. To expand its global LNG footprint, ExxonMobil projects also include a $10 billion Golden Pass LNG project in the United States, which will have an export capacity of 18 million tons of LNG, beginning at the end of 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2025, the company expects to achieve its first LNG sales from the Golden Pass development and from the Qatar North Field East expansion. These projects in the pipeline set the stage for future growth for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in the LNG sector, allowing it to make it to our list of the 10 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy.\n\nOverall XOM ranks 5th on our list of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks to buy according to analysts.

In addition, Guyana has deployed air patrol and coast guard assets to boost surveillance of territorial waters.\n\n\u201cGuyana\u2019s maritime boundaries are recognized under international law, and this incursion is a matter of grave concern. We will remain in close contact with our partners in protecting Guyana\u2019s interests,\u201d said President Ali.\n\nUS State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs was among foreign partners to stand in solidarity with Guyana. \u201cVenezuelan naval vessels threatening ExxonMobil\u2019s FPSO unit is unacceptable and a clear violation of Guyana\u2019s maritime territory. Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,\u201d commented the Bureau.\n\nGuyana and Venezuela have a long-standing territorial dispute, with the matter currently before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Guyana brought the case before the ICJ in 2018, seeking a final judgement on its internationally recognized boundary.\n\nVenezuela claims the oil-rich Essequibo Region, which is under the control of Guyana. The area is located on the northwestern flank of Guyana, and constitutes nearly 70 percent of the country\u2019s national territory. On several occasions, Venezuela has issued decrees to annex the region. In January, President Maduro went further to announce that Venezuela will conduct gubernatorial elections in Essequibo. This goes against an ICJ order issued back in December 2023. The order restricts Venezuela from interfering with the governance of Essequibo until the court renders a final judgment. The decision is expected by next year.\n\nVenezuela intensified its ownership claims of Essequibo in 2015 after ExxonMobil revealed commercially viable oil reservoirs located offshore from the region.\n\nExxon is an American company, and tensions between the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the White House are elevated at present. The Trump administration announced last week that it would be ending a partial license for Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. Gulf Coast, cutting off one of the regime's few remaining sources of foreign currency.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Couch Potato Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio.\n\nCouch Potato investing is the concept of having a portfolio of assets that operate almost entirely on autopilot. This portfolio is intended to withstand shifting market circumstances without needing investors to make major modifications to their asset allocation or objectives. In 1991, Scott Burns came up with the idea, seeking to construct the simplest investment strategy possible: a 50/50 combination of equities and bonds using only two funds. Burns claims that this makes it possibly the most accessible portfolio available, stating that anyone who \u201ccan divide by 2\u201d can understand it.\n\nBarclays calculated the weighted average returns of hedge fund portfolios by investor type, which ranged from 10% to 11%. Based on performance, a conventional 60/40 portfolio model would have comfortably outperformed these gains. According to the Lazy Portfolio ETF, a 60% stock/40% bond strategy incorporating the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Total Bond Market Index Fund would have returned little less than 15% in 2024. Even after 5 years, including 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell in value, the 60/40 method has an average return of 8%. In essence, couch potato investing is a more conservative version of the 60/40 method. More importantly, its dependability shines through in difficult circumstances. For example, between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 sank 43.1%, whereas the couch potato portfolio declined just 6.3%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, one possible downside of the couch potato portfolio is that it tends to underperform during notable market upswings. Portfolios with a larger allocation to equities can better capitalize on bullish markets, resulting in higher returns than the more conservative couch potato strategy. This disparity is especially prominent when the proportion of shares in a portfolio exceeds the couch potato approach\u2019s balanced 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds. However, Burns recommends that investors evaluate this strategy comprehensively.\n\n\u201cYour 35-year portfolio, for instance, was worth $884,481 at the end of 2021 and declined $155,601 during 2022. That\u2019s a loss greater than the original $100,000 value. But so what? The portfolio is way larger than expected or needed. The good news here is that the historical evidence shows, once again, that we can get through some pretty hard times if we keep our investments simple and cheap.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nAlthough couch potato investing discourages individual stock trading in favor of index investment, we chose to examine the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and identified some of its best holdings for this list. These equities were then filtered down further based on many parameters, including the hedge fund sentiment around them, a history of stable dividend payments, and well-established businesses.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) engages in the production, trading, transportation, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and specialty goods. The firm is also concentrating on low-emission options such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, and sustainable fuel development.\n\nThe company aims to more than triple its Permian output and produce 1.3 million bpd from its very profitable assets in Guyana. As a result, XOM expects to provide incremental growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of this decade.\n\nIn December, RBC Capital maintained its Sector Perform rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), with a price target of $115. The firm\u2019s study recognized Exxon Mobil\u2019s goal of increasing its activities in the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as its LNG business. The company\u2019s capital investment is increasingly focused on new growth areas. According to RBC Capital\u2019s projections, Exxon Mobil\u2019s free cash flow yield is estimated to be 5.4% in 2025, rising to 9% by 2030.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This is a serious development concerning our nation's maritime territory. We will not tolerate threats to territorial integrity.\"\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez disputed Ali's claims and called ExxonMobil's oil installations \"illegal.\"\n\n\"He's telling bald-faced lies,\" she said in a statement, referring to Guyana's president.\n\nThe Trump administration, which this week took swift action to tighten sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro 's government, echoed Ali's concerns.\n\n\"Further provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,\" the U.S. State Department said on X.\n\nFeud over land and maritime borders\n\nAli said the Venezuelan vessel passed close to several huge vessels used to store oil being produced by three oilfields operated by Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC of China in the Stabroek Block containing an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil. He said several aircraft and marine vessels had been deployed to support the large number of drill ships, seismic vessels and support ships operating in the bloc.\n\nSaturday's development came two weeks after armed men, suspected Venezuelan pirates operating in the border Cuyuni River, exchanged gunfire with a Guyanese military patrol, injuring six soldiers, two of them seriously.\n\nSince ExxonMobil made its major oil discovery in Guyana in 2015, Venezuela has revived a century-old territorial dispute with Guyana and taken steps to annex the remote Essequibo region that comprises about two thirds of Guyana's land mass.\n\nThe two neighbouring states have feuded over land and maritime borders for decades as Venezuela claims that an 1890s boundaries commission cheated it out of the oil rich region. The area was administered by Britain for more than a century, and it has been under Guyanese control since 1966, when the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom.",

            "content": "Updated on March 1st, 2025 by Felix Martinez\n\n\n\nLong histories of dividend growth are not typical in the energy sector. The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical, preventing the vast majority of companies from raising their dividends yearly without interruption.\n\nWhen oil and gas prices are high, energy companies enjoy a windfall that flows through to investors. But when commodity prices decline, profits evaporate, and in some cases, dividends as well.\n\nAs a result, there are just two oil stocks on the list of Dividend Aristocrats. One of them, Exxon Mobil (XOM), is the largest oil company in the U.S.\n\nYou can download the full list of all 69 Dividend Aristocrats, with important metrics like dividend yield and price-to-earnings ratios, by clicking on the link below:\n\nDisclaimer: Sure Dividend is not affiliated with S&P Global in any way. S&P Global owns and maintains The Dividend Aristocrats Index. The information in this article and downloadable spreadsheet is based on Sure Dividend\u2019s own review, summary, and analysis of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) and other sources, and is meant to help individual investors better understand this ETF and the index upon which it is based. None of the information in this article or spreadsheet is official data from S&P Global. Consult S&P Global for official information.\n\nOil and gas can be a \u201cboom-and-bust\u201d industry. Profits are highly dependent upon commodity prices, which fluctuate wildly in any given year depending on supply and demand forces.\n\nBut Exxon Mobil is different. It traces its roots to Standard Oil, which was founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1870.\n\nThis article will provide an in-depth look at the founder of Big Oil and a Dividend Aristocrat, Exxon Mobil.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nStandard Oil dominated the U.S. oil and gas industry in its early days. It did this with a laser-like focus on drilling innovation, production growth, and limiting costs to beat its competitors. Standard Oil was almost too successful\u2014it grew rapidly that in 1911, it was dissolved by the U.S. Supreme Court on antitrust grounds.\n\nStandard Oil was broken up into 33 smaller companies, many of which became giants on their own, such as Chevron (CVX).\n\nExxon Mobil operates in three business segments. The Upstream segment includes oil and gas exploration and production. Downstream activities include refining and marketing. Manufactured chemicals include olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics.\n\nExxon Mobil is one of the largest energy stocks in the world. In early February, Exxon reported (1/31/25) financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nOil and gas prices have corrected off their peak, but they remain elevated. As a result, Exxon Mobil could still achieve earnings per share of about $7.60 this year.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe climate for oil and gas majors remains challenged because oil prices are still down by nearly half from the peak levels of 2014. As a result, oil producers cannot rely on rising prices for revenue and earnings growth. Instead, rising production will be key. Thanks to its promising growth projects, Exxon expects to grow its production from about 4.0 to 5.0 million barrels per day by the end of 2025.\n\nOn January 31st, 20205, the company reported its fourth quarter and full-year results. In 2024, the company reported $33.7 billion in earnings and $55.0 billion in cash flow from operations, marking its third-best year in a decade. The company achieved record production in the Permian and Guyana, returned $36.0 billion to shareholders, and realized $12.1 billion in cost savings since 2019.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings were $7.6 billion, with $8.0 billion in free cash flow. Annual capital expenditures reached $27.6 billion, aligning with guidance. CEO Darren Woods emphasized strong financial and operational performance, highlighting ExxonMobil\u2019s ability to sustain growth and shareholder returns through 2030 and beyond. ExxonMobil maintained financial strength with a $23.2 billion year-end cash balance and a 6% net debt-to-capital ratio. The company increased its annual dividend for the 42nd consecutive year and extended its $20 billion share repurchase program through 2026, despite lower refining margins, strong production growth positions ExxonMobil for long-term success.\n\nNevertheless, given this business\u2019s high cyclicality, it is reasonable to expect a -2% average annual decline of earnings per share over the next five years off the record-high comparison base.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nCompetitive Advantages & Recession Performance\n\nExxon Mobil enjoys several competitive advantages, primarily its tremendous scale, which allows it to cut costs when times are tough. The company is also the global leader in expertise in its business, as most oil companies follow the technical procedures that Exxon Mobil has written.\n\nExxon Mobil also has the financial strength to invest heavily in new growth opportunities. In the past few years, the company has allocated tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures to support future growth.\n\nAnother competitive advantage is Exxon Mobil\u2019s industry-leading balance sheet. It has a credit rating of AA-, which helps it keep a low cost of capital.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s integrated business model allows the company to remain profitable, even during recessions and periods of low commodity prices. The company saw volatility during the Great Recession but still remained profitable:\n\n2007 earnings-per-share of $7.26\n\n2008 earnings-per-share of $8.66 (19% increase)\n\n2009 earnings-per-share of $3.98 (54% decline)\n\n2010 earnings-per-share of $6.22 (56% increase)\n\nContinuing to generate steady profits allowed Exxon Mobil to raise its dividend yearly. The oil major has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years.\n\nValuation & Expected Returns\n\nExxon\u2019s industry is highly cyclical. Commodity prices drive results, and hence they are highly volatile. We believe that the energy market is corrected from the peak of its cycle and expect oil and gas prices to deflate in the upcoming years, primarily due to the record number of clean energy projects currently under development.\n\nWe expect Exxon Mobil to earn about $7.60 per share in 2025 and incur a -2% average annual decline of earnings per share over the next five years.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6. This is slightly higher than our fair value estimate of 13 times earnings. A declining earnings multiple could reduce annual returns by 2% over the next five years.\n\nDividends will add to shareholder returns. Exxon Mobil has grown its dividend for 42 consecutive years and currently offers a 3.7% yield. Given all the above factors, Exxon Mobil stock can be reasonably expected to provide a -0.3% average annual total return over the next five years.\n\nThe poor expected return should be expected, given that we are near the peak of this highly cyclical industry\u2019s cycle. We recommend selling Exxon at its current price. The stock\u2019s dividend yield is also near a decade low, another possible signal that the stock is overvalued from a long-term perspective.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nExxon Mobil posted record earnings last year thanks to exceptionally favorable global oil and gas conditions. Even better, as these conditions are not likely to change significantly soon, the oil major is expected to continue thriving in the upcoming quarters.\n\nNevertheless, due to this industry\u2019s high cyclicality and elevated valuation, XOM stock is unattractive from a long-term perspective.\n\nFurther Reading: The Chowder Rule | How To Calculate The Chowder Number.\n\nAdditionally, the following Sure Dividend databases contain the most reliable dividend growers in our investment universe:\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for stocks with unique dividend characteristics, consider the following Sure Dividend databases:\n\nThe Complete List of Monthly Dividend Stocks: stocks that pay dividends each month, for 12 payments over the year.\n\nThe Blue Chip Stocks List: this database contains stocks that qualify as either Dividend Achievers, Dividend Aristocrats, or Dividend Kings.\n\nThe major domestic stock market indices are another solid resource for finding investment ideas.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before Spring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nSeasonality in the Stock Market\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nSectors Outperforming in Spring\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\n\u201cIn the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\u201d\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks outperformed the market, surpassing all other sectors. Financial markets surged sharply and widely following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This spike was mostly driven by market confidence about a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025. Furthermore, Spring generally results in higher consumer spending as people receive tax refunds and engage in activities like home buying. This rise in spending may lead to increased loan demand and transaction volumes for banks and financial institutions.\n\nSeasonal demand has a substantial impact on energy sector performance as well. One clear explanation for good spring performance is the seasonal availability of renewable energy producing sources. Toward the end of 2024, energy sector equities had significant volatility, gaining by more than 6% in November before falling over 10% in December. The broader market\u2019s energy sector closed 2024 with a return of only 5.72%. Despite trailing the market last year, Spring may bring better fortune, as refineries ramp up gasoline output to match the expected increase in travel during the warmer months. This can lead to increased crude oil prices, which will boost the performance of energy equities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best spring stocks, we selected some of the best financial services and energy firms with the most hedge fund investors in Q4 2024, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is involved in the production, trading, transportation, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and specialized goods. The company intends to more than triple its Permian output and generate 1.3 million bpd from its very lucrative assets in Guyana. As a result, XOM anticipates an incremental growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of the decade.\n\nUnder its 2030 strategy, Exxon Mobil intends to invest up to $30 billion in low-emission activities between 2025 and 2030. Furthermore, it has worked with the Texas General Land Office to create the biggest offshore carbon dioxide storage facility in the United States.\n\nRBC Capital maintained Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) Sector Perform rating in December, with a $115 price target. The firm\u2019s assessment acknowledged ExxonMobil\u2019s objective of expanding its operations in the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as its LNG business. Moreover, according to RBC Capital\u2019s predictions, Exxon Mobil\u2019s free cash flow yield will be 5.4% in 2025, increasing to 9% by 2030.\n\nOverall XOM ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks to buy before spring. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In 2023, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro stoked tension by seeking a referendum on laying claim to a large part of Guyana.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vessel is still in our waters,\u201d said Brigadier Omar Khan, head of the Guyana Defence Force, adding that \u201cfrom all indications, it is heading toward Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe US State Department called the threat by Venezuela unacceptable. \u201cFurther provocation will result in consequences for the Maduro regime,\u201d the department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X, without elaborating.\n\nGuyana\u2019s president, Irfaan Ali, said the armed patrol ship transmitted a radio message informing the vessel that it was operating in disputed international waters before continuing its course to other vessels in the area.\n\n\u201cDuring this incursion, the Venezuelan vessel approached various assets in our exclusive waters, including FPSO Prosperity,\u201d Ali said, referring to one of the Exxon-contracted vessels.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExxon discovered Stabroek in 2015. The territorial dispute, which dates back more than a century, flared up as Maduro sought to galvanize supporters for last year\u2019s presidential election, where he claimed victory in what observers called a stolen vote. Exxon didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDelcy Rodriguez, Venezuela\u2019s vice president, lashed back at Ali, calling him \u201cthe Caribbean Zelensky\u201d in reference to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Rodriguez said in a statement that the waters are not part of Guyana but instead \u201ca maritime zone pending delimitation in accordance with international law\u201d.\n\nKhan said the Guyana Defence Force is monitoring the course of the vessel.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best crude oil stocks to buy right now.\n\nCrude oil markets have seen extreme volatility over the past year, fueled by a variety of economic, geopolitical, and supply and demand factors. Prices fell at the end of 2023, when international demand faltered and supply remained strong from key regions, before rebounding in early 2024 as leading oil-producing countries implemented supply cuts to stabilize the market. Meanwhile, demand signals have been mixed \u2014 industrial activity in major economies has improved, but high interest rates and inflationary pressures have limited overall energy consumption. After the presidential elections in the US, the Trump 2.0 agenda appears to be driving cracks in the economic outlook, due to a plethora of initiatives such as tariffs, a fight with immigration, and significant cuts in government spending. Despite Republicans notoriously being pro-business and pro-carbon, as confirmed by an announced policy of encouraging energy exploration and production on Federal land and Outer Continental Shelf, the reaction of the stock market has been mixed, as many crude oil stocks have underperformed the broad market in the last couple of months.\n\nThe reluctance of the broad market to price in an acceleration in the crude oil space is likely due to expectations of lower oil prices, primarily driven by an uncertain economic and industrial outlook. A slowing economy generally consumes less oil, which coupled with an increasing supply should put downward pressure on prices. Optimism for the year ahead vanished and the outlook has become one of the gloomiest since the pandemic. Companies started to signal widespread concerns about the impact of government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments. For instance, the US economic surprise index hit the lowest last week since September, while the business capex forecasts were abruptly cut at the beginning of the year. Small businesses reflect similar signals, by cutting their capex expectations (as per surveys), while consumers report deteriorating financial expectations going forward. All these developments don\u2019t play out in favor of a strong economy in the following quarters.\n\nFinancial markets have reflected this turbulence, as energy stocks moved in tandem with the swings in oil prices, which retracted more than 10% since the inauguration day. While refiners and midstream companies have generally performed well due to resilient transportation and processing demand, exploration and production firms have faced challenges in securing new investments. Looking forward, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors will continue to shape the crude oil market. Geopolitical factors, particularly in key oil-producing regions, remain an ongoing concern \u2013 with the end of the Ukraine conflict becoming a reality, Russian oil will likely flow more freely abroad, putting even more downward pressure on global prices. Despite the aforementioned headwinds, there are also some positive takeaways for investors \u2013 while renewable energy investments continue to grow, the transition remains gradual, ensuring that crude oil will remain a critical component of the global energy mix in the future, especially under the carbon-friendly Trump 2.0 regime. Furthermore, with oil prices declining and many crude oil stocks being down from their mid-2024 highs, the current developments may turn out to be a great long-term buying opportunity.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Insider Monkey proprietary hedge fund holding database and identified the 11 most popular crude oil companies, ranked by the number of hedge funds that own the stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world\u2019s largest integrated energy companies, engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. With operations spanning six continents, XOM has a significant presence in major oil-producing regions, including the Permian Basin, offshore Guyana, and the Middle East. Its upstream segment focuses on crude oil and natural gas extraction, while its downstream business operates a vast refining and petrochemical network, supplying fuels, lubricants, and chemicals to global markets. The company is also a major player in LNG and is investing in carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels as part of its long-term energy strategy. Despite expanding into lower-carbon initiatives, crude oil remains central to XOM\u2019s operations. The US-based company ranked 7th on our recent list of 10 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock in 2025.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) delivered strong 2024 results with earnings of $34 billion, marking their third-highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. The company generated cash flow from operations of $55 billion and achieved a ROCE of 13%. In the Upstream segment, the company achieved the highest-ever production from advantaged assets and the highest liquids production from their overall portfolio in more than 40 years. The Permian Basin operations delivered record production from both Heritage ExxonMobil assets and Pioneer assets, with production expected by management to grow from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030. In Guyana, the company achieved record production, reaching 650,000 barrels per day in just 10 years.\n\nLooking forward, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) expects to bring online several major projects in 2025 that will deliver more than $3 billion in earnings potential in 2026 at both constant and current prices and margins. The company plans to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio with 60% of Upstream production from advantaged assets by 2030. Management expects to generate $20 billion more in earnings and $30 billion more in cash flow by 2030 while taking an additional $6 billion in cost out of the business. XOM is also developing new technology-driven businesses, such as Proxxima products and carbon materials, which creates opportunities to expand beyond traditional fuels and chemicals into higher growth, higher-margin markets that are decoupled from commodity price fluctuations. All in all, the management outlook is highly optimistic and largely immune to short-term oil price developments.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of best crude oil stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "The Brazilian oil producer has joined other majors including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. who continued to reward shareholders even though free cash flow has become strained at current oil prices.\n\nPetrobras announced 9.1 billion reais ($1.6 billion) in dividends on Wednesday that trailed estimates after a surprise loss in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe payout fell short of expected dividends of $2.8 billion, the average of five analyst estimates reviewed by Bloomberg. The Brazilian oil producer has joined other majors including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. who continued to reward shareholders even though free cash flow has become strained at current oil prices.\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro-based producer reported a net loss of 17 billion reais ($2.9 billion) in the fourth quarter due to \u201cexclusive events\u201d including the accounting impact of a sharp currency devaluation, it said in a filing. Without the one-off events net income would have been 17.7 billion reais, it said.\n\nThe dividend fell by about half from the previous quarter in a disappointment to investors. Petrobras has been a cash cow despite political attacks on its dividend policy at the start of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cPetrobras\u2019 results in 2024 were impacted mainly by an item of an accounting nature,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Fernando Melgarejo said in the filing, where he cited \u201cthe exchange rate variation in debts between Petrobras and its subsidiaries abroad.\u201d\n\nAnalysts were expecting 18.35 billion reais in net income, according Bloomberg consensus. Brazil\u2019s real was the worst performing major currency in 2024. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, was 41 billion reais, trailing the 61.9 billion-reais estimate.\n\nPetrobras\u2019 American depositary receipts were down 3.6 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nAbout 83 percent of analysts currently recommend buying Petrobras, compared with 39 percent when CEO Magda Chambriard began her term last year last May, according to Bloomberg data. The payouts have also helped shore up the finances of the federal government, Petrobras\u2019s controlling shareholder. Petrobras made 103 billion reais in dividend payments in 2024, it said.\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro SA, as it is formally known, reported earlier this month a decline in oil and gas production and weaker sales and exports during the quarter. Maintenance-related stoppages at offshore platforms and natural declines at mature fields caused the drop in output.\n\nThe company\u2019s success at reversing its production decline will affect global oil supplies at a time when OPEC and its allies are trying to gauge when they can start unwinding output cuts. After lackluster production at Petrobras in 2024, and some drilling setbacks during the first quarter, output is expected to start growing again in 2025 at the giant deep-water projects that have made Brazil a significant source of non-OPEC exports. The company expects production to increase 100,000 barrels a day on average this year.\n\nInvestors continue to track the pace of investments at Petrobras, including acquisitions and investments in less-profitable renewables projects. While the spending hasn\u2019t picked up yet, there is concern that renewables investments could erode Petrobras\u2019s ability to pay dividends.\n\nIn a message to investors, Chambriard vowed to replenish oil and gas reserves and pursue a \u201cprofitable diversification\u201d of its portfolio. Petrobras\u2019s top boss said the company is making progress at studying partnerships with major players for the production of ethanol.\n\nA January increase in diesel prices sent a positive signal to investors who had been concerned about the company subsidizing fuel to help the government contain inflation.\n\nChambriard has said Petrobras will continue to return cash to shareholders as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt its financial health and ability to invest. She has vowed to \u201cstep on the accelerator\u201d with investments in oil equipment and services, such as expanding a fleet of support vessels and expanding refining capacity. The oil producer spent $16.6 billion a 31 percent increase compared to 2023.\n\nThe chief executive has appeared with Lula to announce infrastructure investments and is clearly committed to help the government grow the economy. Analysts have expressed concern that the company could come under political pressure ahead of the 2026 presidential election, making its shares more volatile.",

Here's why.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe basics: Exxon vs. Devon\n\nDevon Energy is what is known as an upstream company, which means it produces oil and natural gas. It also focuses its business geographically, by only drilling for energy in the U.S. market. The stock can be highly volatile given that oil and gas prices are the main driver of its financial results on the top and bottom lines. There are simply no other divisions to help offset the ups and downs of its drilling operations.\n\nExxonMobil operates in the upstream, too. And oil and natural gas prices will have a material impact on its financial performance as well. However, Exxon also operates in the midstream and the downstream areas.\n\nThe midstream is comprised of energy transportation assets like pipelines. This vital energy infrastructure tends to produce reliable cash flows through the energy cycle. The downstream is made up of chemical and refining operations. These businesses can be just as volatile as the upstream, but often in a counter cyclical way since oil and natural gas are key inputs to these operations.\n\nWhile Exxon's results will vary along with energy prices, the peaks and valleys tend to be less extreme than they would be for a pure-play producer like Devon Energy. That's the benefit provided by Exxon's diversification across the entire energy sector.\n\nWhich is the better oil stock?\n\nThe truth is that there is nothing inherently wrong with either Exxon or Devon. But they aren't going to be appropriate for the same kinds of investors. Exxon, perhaps obviously, will be more appealing to conservative types. That's a function of its diversified business model but there's more to like than just that.\n\nFor starters, Exxon's dividend has been increased annually for an impressive 42 years and counting. Even if you aren't a dividend-focused investor, that speaks to the resilience of the business. And if you are a dividend lover, it suggests that you can buy Exxon and comfortably collect your quarterly checks for years to come. The dividend yield, meanwhile, is 3.5%. That's well above the market's 1.2% yield, but not exactly a huge yield for Exxon historically speaking.\n\nIf you are looking to add energy exposure to your income portfolio right now, it is probably still worth buying. That's particularly true given that its balance sheet is among the strongest in the integrated energy peer group. Basically, it is prepared to deal with the next energy downturn when it eventually arrives. If you have a value bias or prefer higher yields, however, you might want to wait for that downturn. It will be hard to buy while Exxon's business is struggling, but that is, historically speaking, the best time to jump aboard.\n\nDevon Energy isn't likely to appeal to conservative investors and its 3.3% yield is lower than Exxon's yield so it probably won't attract income investors, either. So who would prefer Devon over Exxon? Investors who have a strong feeling about energy prices. That ventures into market timing, which is a very difficult thing to do successfully over the long term.\n\nHowever, Devon is a well-respected company, has a low breakeven point, and has a large inventory of land on which to drill in the future. So this is hardly a throw-caution-to-the-wind type of investment. In fact, Devon Energy has consistently paid dividends for many years. It couldn't have done that without being a well-run company.\n\nThat said, in recent years Devon has paid a variable dividend driven by its financial results. Spiking energy prices following the coronavirus pandemic period fueled those extra dividends. Those extra dividends have dried up thanks to normalizing energy prices and Devon's acquisition-driven growth efforts (it is paying down debt instead of paying dividends, which is a good capital allocation decision).\n\nWhile the financial results and the stock price are always going to be volatile, Devon Energy is still growing its business despite operating in the shadows of giants like Exxon. While only more aggressive investors will want to look at Devon, it is overall a fairly well-run energy company.\n\nExxon or Devon? It depends.\n\nThere are very few easy answers when it comes to investing, and the choice between Exxon and Devon is no different. A deep energy downturn would lead to more attractive prices for each of these energy stocks, of course, so figuring out which one you like most now may let you prepare to buy when everyone else is selling.\n\nThat said, Exxon will be most appropriate for conservative investors looking for broad energy industry exposure while Devon is a better fit for aggressive investors who have a constructive view of energy prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Devon Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

In addition, there are facilities for battery exchange for two-wheeled electric vehicles at certain locations.\n\n3.

            "content": "Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nGlobal dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nDividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market\u2014excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.\n\nThe sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHistorically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America.

In other words, Big Oil is doubling down on destruction, and Shell and BP don\u2019t want to be left behind.\n\nA Shell-BP merger would create an empire capable of taking on ExxonMobil ($480 billion market cap) and Chevron ($282 billion), solidifying its place among the biggest climate criminals on the planet. Supporters claim consolidation will magically bring \u201cefficiencies\u201d and \u201cfinancial resilience,\u201d while conveniently ignoring the inevitable job cuts, regulatory nightmares, and intensified climate devastation. Antitrust regulators might object, but when has that ever stopped the oil industry from bulldozing over public interest?\n\nMeanwhile, Shell\u2019s leadership is playing it cool, insisting they\u2019re focused on \u201corganic growth,\u201d while BP\u2019s stock continues to disappoint its shareholders. Enter activist investor Elliott Investment Management, the money-hungry puppeteer pulling the strings behind the scenes, pushing BP to make desperate moves to stay relevant.\n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t dystopian enough, Big Oil\u2019s consolidation binge isn\u2019t stopping here. ExxonMobil\u2019s $59.5 billion Pioneer Natural Resources grab strengthens its grip on the Permian Basin, while Chevron\u2019s $53 billion Hess deal secures its control over Guyana\u2019s lucrative offshore reserves. Translation: U.S. oil giants are cementing their dominance, while European majors like Shell and BP scramble to stay in the game, conveniently blaming their struggles on pesky \u201cclimate policies.\u201d\n\nSo, why the sudden urge to merge? Because the energy transition is exposing their dirty business model, and oil execs are desperate to secure fossil fuel profits while pretending they care about renewables. A Shell-BP merger would allow these climate arsonists to hoard even more resources, claim financial \u201cstrength\u201d for a green transition they\u2019ll never truly commit to, and squeeze out every last dollar before the world burns.\n\nGeopolitical considerations play a role, too. Shell and BP merging would give Western oil giants even greater control over key energy reserves, just like ExxonMobil\u2019s Pioneer buyout and Chevron\u2019s Hess acquisition have strengthened the U.S. oil stranglehold. And, of course, shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard are watching closely, eager for their next payday. After all, nothing boosts dividends like slashing jobs and ramping up climate destruction.\n\nWhile this particular merger remains speculative, one thing is clear: Big Oil is on a consolidation spree, and the planet is paying the price. Subsea7 and Saipem have already jumped on the bandwagon, merging into a $4.63 billion offshore energy services monster, complete with promises of \u201ccost savings\u201d and \u201cefficiency\u201d\u2014aka, prioritizing profit over planet.\n\nWith oil companies frantically merging to cling to relevance, expect more of these \u201cstrategic\u201d deals. But let\u2019s be honest: this is not about sustainability or efficiency. It\u2019s about securing power, maximizing shareholder profits, and delaying the inevitable collapse of the fossil fuel empire.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "One of the primary reasons behind stock buybacks is to support the share price during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility. It is well known that the management possesses insider information and has much greater visibility into the business trajectory; thus, when a company perceives that its stock is undervalued and repurchases significant amount of its own stock, it can signal confidence and boost morale among the entire shareholder base. Successful investors like Warren Buffett have spoken favorably about buybacks when executed at prices below intrinsic value, emphasizing that they can be an intelligent use of capital when alternative investments offer lower returns. However, buybacks have also faced scrutiny for their potential to artificially inflate stock prices and reward executives who are compensated based on EPS growth. The debate intensifies when companies borrow money to finance these operations, which can strain balance sheets in times of economic distress and depletes the cash reserves without any claw-back option.\n\nStock repurchases are the most discretionary form of capital allocation and have also become over time the most dominant for the US corporations. Unlike dividends, which create a recurring obligation, or capital expenditures, which are often a necessity to maintain the business operations going, buybacks offer flexibility \u2013 companies can repurchase shares when excess cash is available and halt the program during downturns or when capital allocation priorities shift. A buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares, effectively increasing earnings per share, and are therefore often seen as a form of instant gratification \u2013 prefer immediate upward pressure on stock prices over long-term gains from strategic reinvestments. Critics argue that buybacks can signal a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities in the core business, as firms would most likely prioritize any potential project that could strengthen the competitive position and boost the growth trajectory. While such scenarios are certainly possible in some cases, proponents view stock repurchases as a natural adjustment to limited or uncertain growth opportunities or a way to return excess cash to investors in a more tax-efficient way than dividends.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other companies that are buying back their stock in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent legislative developments have placed buybacks under greater regulatory and tax scrutiny \u2013 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, aimed at curbing excessive reliance on buybacks and encouraging reinvestment in business operations and employee wages. In short, the purpose behind these regulatory attempts was to limit the hoarding of capital into investors\u2019 hands and stimulate reinvestments that would fuel economic growth and create jobs. Despite this, repurchase activity remains robust, with S&P 500 firms continuing to allocate substantial capital to buybacks. For reference, data published by S&P Global shows that the total dollar volume of stock repurchases during 3Q 2024 increased 22% YoY. Some investors argue that government regulations will have limited impact, as corporations may simply adjust capital allocation strategies or increase leverage to maintain shareholder returns. As the US stock market experienced a strong rally throughout 2024 and reaching new all-time highs in the second half of the year extending into 2025, studying companies that repurchase significant amounts of their own stock may offer unique insights into their business; the key question to answer though is whether these operations signal an undervalued stock price or a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities in the near-term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of companies that are buying back stock we selected the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 index with the largest dollar volume of shares repurchased during Q3 2024, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices. We ranked them according to their buyback activity for the quarter and also added the number of hedge fund holders for each company in this analysis.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 208 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Buying Back Its Stock in 2025?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nQ3 2024 buybacks: $5.51 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals. With a global footprint, XOM operates across the entire energy supply chain, from upstream extraction to downstream refining and advanced chemical manufacturing. The company is also investing in lower-emission technologies, including carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels, as part of its long-term energy transition strategy.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported strong earnings of $8.6 billion in Q3 2024, marking one of their best third quarters in the past decade. The company\u2019s transformation efforts have significantly improved its earnings power, with Energy Products segment showing year-to-date earnings roughly double compared to 2019 on a constant margin basis. Production grew to 4.6 million oil equivalent barrels per day, representing a 24% increase YoY. During the same quarter, XOM repurchased $5.51 billion of its own stock, which we believe represents a reasonable return of its record earnings to investors \u2013 the energy volumes in the US are still significantly lower than in the previous decades, and the tailwinds from the executive orders of the new administration had not kicked in at that time. For the full year 2024, the company generated cash flow from operations of $55 billion, which is the third highest in a decade \u2013 management mentions the funds will be used to finance profitable growth, maintain financial strength, and reward shareholders, which leads us to the conclusion that XOM is able to maintain a perfect balance between reinvestments and capital returns.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 7th on our list of companies that are buying back their stock in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other S&P 500 dividend aristocrats sorted by hedge fund sentiment.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. While they are an integral part of the broader market, they have been overshadowed recently by the surge in technology stocks. In 2024, the Dividend Aristocrats Index rose by about 6%, trailing the broader market\u2019s nearly 27% gain and NASDAQ\u2019s impressive 35% return. However, the long-term appeal of dividend stocks remains strong. These companies have proved their mettle, continuing to reward shareholders even during challenging market conditions.\n\nHistorical data underscores the effectiveness of dividends in keeping pace with inflation and cushioning the effects of economic downturns over the past century. This makes them a crucial element of long-term investment strategies. Dividend payouts have remained relatively stable compared to earnings per share across multiple recessions. For instance, during the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis, while the broader market dropped by 41% and earnings per share plunged by 92%, dividends per share declined by just 6%, according to a report by The Vanguard Group. This stability plays a key role in preserving income streams and enhancing total returns, which factor in both price appreciation and reinvested dividends.\n\nREAD ALSO: These Were Last Week\u2019s 10 Best Dividend Stocks\n\nThe report also emphasized the importance of diversifying investments across different sectors and regions to safeguard against industry-specific downturns and geopolitical uncertainties. A clear example of this occurred during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 when European banks, following regulatory directives, suspended dividend payments to account for potential loan losses. Although many banks were financially capable of maintaining payouts, most distributions were delayed until 2021, disrupting investors\u2019 regular income. Adopting a diversified investment strategy not only helps stabilize cash flow but also strengthens overall returns, making portfolios more resilient to economic volatility.\n\nThat said, a company\u2019s history of annual dividend increases, no matter how long, does not guarantee future payouts. The year 2020 served as a significant test of the stability of Dividend Aristocrats. When the pandemic hit in March, consumer demand plummeted across various industries, leading many companies to reduce or suspend their dividends. Some made this decision voluntarily, while others were required to do so as a condition of accepting stimulus funds. By the end of 2020, a total of 66 companies within the broader market had distributed less in dividends compared to 2019.\n\nIn recent years, dividend investing has gained popularity, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility. Investors have increasingly recognized the value of dividend stocks, steadily allocating capital to them to benefit from their long-term potential. Annual dividend payouts from the broader market have been rising, climbing from $420 billion in 2017 to $522 billion in 2021 and reaching a record $588.2 billion by 2023. This upward trend highlights the role of dividend stocks in generating both growth and income over time. In addition, dividends have been a significant driver of overall market returns, accounting for approximately 17% of the total return from 2013 to 2022, according to a Morgan Stanley report.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nDividend aristocrats are the companies that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. We scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and picked the top 10 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "The Kipper 1B project 'will bring online much-needed additional gas supply' for the domestic market ahead of winter 2026.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. and its partners have agreed to invest nearly $200 million to develop an additional well to grow production in the Kipper field offshore Australia ahead of winter 2026.\n\nThe Kipper 1B project \u201cwill bring online much-needed additional gas supply from the Gippsland Basin\u201d, ExxonMobil said in an online statement.\n\nThe project also involves \u201csignificant upgrades to the West Tuna platform\u201d, the United States oil giant said. Drilling is set to start later this year, with the upgrades happening simultaneously.\n\n\u201cEsso Australia continues to invest in multiple projects that ensure our Gippsland operations sustain gas production well into the 2030s\u201d, commented Simon Younger, chair of ExxonMobil for Australia.\n\n\u201cProjects like Kipper 1B are vital to help meet the country\u2019s energy security needs by bringing new supply online, which will be used exclusively for Australia\u2019s domestic market\u201d.\n\nLast year the partners finished installing compression facilities in the Kipper field to maintain natural gas production.\n\nThe field \u201cexperiences decreasing reservoir pressure as it depletes\u201d, requiring additional compression on the West Tuna platform to keep gas flowing to the domestic market, ExxonMobil said October 18, 2024, announcing the completion of the compression project.\n\nKipper currently has a production capacity of 115 terajoules a day of gas. It supplied nearly 60 percent of the southern states\u2019 consumption in 2023, according to ExxonMobil.\n\nIn March 2022, ExxonMobil and BHP Group Ltd., whose oil and gas assets were later acquired by Woodside, announced a AUD 400 million ($253.67 million) investment to deliver an additional 200 petajoules from Kipper between 2023 and 2027.\n\nKipper is part of the Bass Strait Project between ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Bass Strait has numerous conventional oil and gas fields in the Gippsland Basin off the southeast coast of Victoria.\n\nWith several fields in the Bass Strait depleted, the partners in 2024 submitted plans to drill more wells in Kipper and the Turrum field.\n\nDavid Berman, commercial director of ExxonMobil for Australia, told the Australia Domestic Gas Outlook Conference on March 26, 2024, \u201cBy winter next year we expect to have 70 percent fewer gas producing wells than we had in 2010\u201d.\n\n\u201cClearly the addition of new and reliable well stock to the production system will be a significant benefit if in the future the joint venture decides to invest in new gas supply\u201d, Berman cautioned, according to an official transcript.\n\n\u201cAs more legacy fields end production, we will continue to match onshore capacity with reduced offshore capacity, both to produce gas at a competitive cost but also to maintain reliability of gas production for our customers.\n\n\u201cBy the end of this year, we will have invested around 350 million dollars since 2021 to reconfigure Gippsland Basin Joint Venture facilities to produce safely and reliably into the next decade.\n\n\u201cAnd as we step down from three to two gas plants in 2024 and ultimately later in the decade to one gas plant at Longford, reduced onshore processing capacity means growth of gas production forecasts like what we saw in 2021 and 2022 is less likely.\n\n\u201cThese changes have important implications. For Australians on the east coast, ExxonMobil will remain a reliable supplier of gas to our customers, however the decrease in available Gippsland Basin Joint Venture production means the joint venture\u2019s capacity to respond to disruptions that go beyond the needs of our customers to maintain the reliability, resilience, and stability of the system will be reduced\u201d.\n\nExxonMobil operates the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture with a 50 percent stake, with local company Woodside holding the remaining half. ExxonMobil also operates the Kipper Unit Joint Venture with a 32.5 percent stake, with Woodside also owning 32.5 percent and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co. Ltd. having 35 percent.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

Onshore power project faces delay of about three months. Government sees others developing gas if Exxon does not.\n\nGuyana\u2019s Vice President Awaits Exxon\u2019s Offshore Gas Development Plans Amid Booming Economy.\n\nMarianna Parraga and Kemol King, Reuters\n\nGEORGETOWN\n\nEnergiesNet.com 02 25 2025\n\nGuyana\u2019s government expects a consortium led by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) to brief officials by the end of March on plans to develop offshore gas, the country\u2019s vice president told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018by end March, we will tell you what we will do.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re waiting (for),\u201d Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo said in an interview on the sidelines of Guyana\u2019s Energy Conference in Georgetown.\n\nGuyana is the fastest-growing economy in the world thanks to rapid expansion of output from offshore oilfields controlled by the Exxon-led consortium, in which Hess (HES.N) and CNOOC (600938.SS) also participate.\n\n\u201cClearly for us, there shall be a project. We have to monetize the gas, and if Exxon doesn\u2019t want to do it, we already said to them\u2026 we have a lot of people who are interested in doing this on their own,\u201d Jagdeo added.\n\nThe government, which wants to use natural gas to drive growth in the domestic economy, has progressed to award contracts for power and petrochemical projects that will receive gas supplies. It is also exploring options to develop liquefied natural gas facilities to export the fuel.\n\nThe government says there is enough gas at Exxon\u2019s massive Stabroek block for commercial development, while Exxon says it has yet to complete its assessment of the gas resources in the area.\n\nGuyana\u2019s Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo poses for a photo during an interview with Reuters in Georgetown, Guyana, February 16, 2022. Picture taken February 16, 2022. REUTERS/Sabrina Valle\n\nExxon last week announced the \u201cWales Gas Vision\u201c, which outlined what could be done with the offshore gas the consortium is planning to produce, if its assessment shows commercial development is viable.\n\nExxon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nOne of the possibilities could be to jointly develop some gas fields with neighbor Suriname, where offshore reserves have also been discovered, Jagdeo said.\n\nGuyana, which will be entitled to about 50% of gas produced at Stabroek after the Exxon group takes some of the output to recover expenses, last year chose little-known U.S. company Fulcrum LNG as its preferred partner for a project to process and export the gas.\n\nThe startup, which the government expects to partner with the Exxon consortium for that development, has since faced questions over its capacity to execute a project that could need as much as $30 billion.\n\nJagdeo acknowledged external concerns about Fulcrum LNG\u2019s capacity, but said the government believes the company\u2019s team has the potential.\n\n\u201cThey (Fulcrum LNG) demonstrated to our team that they had substantive backing, both to take the gas\u2026 and also for equity investment and raising the capital. So we are hoping that we could continue the tripartite discussion to make this work, Exxon, Fulcrum and the government of Guyana,\u201d he said.\n\nGAS TO SHORE\n\nThe Exxon group reinjects the gas it produces into the oilfields already in operation to maintain pressure at the reservoir. The consortium expects to send a small volume of gas back to shore for power generation as soon as this year, depending on when the power plant is ready.\n\nLast year, it completed a $1 billion pipeline from the fields.\n\nThe bulk of future gas supply is expected to come from the Pluma and Haimara projects, rich in gas resources and seen starting output after 2030.\n\nThe power project, to be built by a consortium between Texas-based Lindsayca and Puerto Rico-based CH4 Systems, faces problems after a three-month delay to hand over the site. The parties could go to arbitration over the delay, but the project will be completed, Jagdeo said.\n\nA separate plan to build a fertilizer plant also connected to Exxon\u2019s pipeline could be offered this year through a tender for companies interested, Jagdeo said.\n\nGuyana is also trying to clear a standoff with Canada-based firms Frontera Energy (FEC.TO) and CGX Energy (OYL.V) over the expiration of an exploration license for a key offshore block where oil reserves were found. The dispute could also end up in arbitration after the government notified Frontera and CGX that it had canceled the license.\n\nThe Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\n\nThe Fortune 500 list includes companies that generate the highest revenue in the United States. In total, Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ approximately 31 million people worldwide. Large-cap stocks, which form most of the Fortune 500, are typically safer investments and offer relative stability in times of economic difficulty.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks so Far in 2025\n\nAfter registering significant gains over the last two years, the broader US market fell sharply on Friday in the wake of weaker-than-expected economic reports and softening consumer demand. A recent report by S&P Global showed that business activity in the US is slowing down, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. The slowdown is primarily a reflection of rising uncertainty about the business environment, especially in relation to federal government policies regarding domestic spending cuts and the constant threat of looming tariffs.\n\nThere are also serious concerns of high inflation due to the said tariffs, causing consumers to be more wary of their spending habits. According to the Tax Foundation, if the tariffs threatened by President Trump are actually imposed, it would amount to an average tax increase of more than $800 per US household in 2025. The tariffs on China alone will add $172 to the tax burden per household, while the rumored imposts on Canadian oil will drive up the price of gas, affecting the entire economy.\n\nThat said, some policy measures promised by the Trump administration can also bode well for US corporations and the overall business environment, including taking a less heavy-handed approach towards mergers than under President Biden\u2019s administration. Moreover, the cornerstone of Trump\u2019s second term will be to relax tax policies and extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire at the end of 2025. The President has campaigned on further reducing the base corporate rate to 20%, with an additional cut to 15% for companies that produce goods on American soil.\n\nAnother important thing to be mindful of was recently highlighted by Bank of America in a note earlier this month, warning investors of the high concentration levels in the market, where a handful of firms command the lion\u2019s share of investments. This is partially because of passive investing, where investors shovel money into indexes indiscriminately. Passive funds now hold a higher percentage of the US stock market than active funds, which can distort market prices and severely mislead investors. To avoid a potential drawdown, the bank has advised its investors to diversify and consider investing in baskets of quality stocks with lower exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks.",

            "content": "Moreover, despite his repeated calls to ramp up oil production in the country, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could make things worse for the refining sector. Many refineries in the Midwest depend on Canadian crude and the upcoming 10% tariff will force them to pay either more for their feedstock, or slash production, further squeezing an industry already in decline. The President wants to make America self-sufficient and independent when it comes to energy, but no matter how much oil the United States pumps, its refineries were designed to process the darker, denser, cheaper crude that is hard to find domestically. However, Trump\u2019s plans to roll back support for electric vehicles and charging stations could slow their sales and bolster gasoline demand, offering some respite to the industry.\n\nThings don\u2019t seem to be getting any better either as according to the International Energy Agency\u2019s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance, putting downward pressure on prices. The US Energy Information Administration stated last month that it expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026, further reducing margins for refiners.\n\n2024 was a difficult year for the global refining sector as industry players faced a drop in profitability to multi-year lows amid soft consumer and industrial demand (especially in China), slowing economic growth, increasing energy transition, and expanding global refining capacity. The declining fuel margins in the Q4 2024 led to disappointing earnings results for many oil refiners, as a flood of new output competed with stagnating demand. This has led to several oil majors shutting down operations and putting their refineries up for sale, but that is also not going as smoothly as expected.\n\nThe United States of America is the Largest Oil Producing Country in the World with current production reaching record levels, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that it is also counted among the Countries with the Largest Refining Capacities . The US had 132 oil refineries with a total capacity of 18.4 million barrels per day (bpd) at the start of 2024, a 2% increase compared with the start of 2023.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Oil Refinery Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best oil refinery stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe rapid energy transition is also a major cause of concern for the refining sector as governments push drivers toward electric vehicles in pursuit of climate goals. So the only way forward is for the industry to adapt and evolve. Several forward-looking refiners are now boosting their resilience by upgrading their facilities to produce higher-value but lower-carbon products such as petrochemicals and renewable fuels, though it will require significant capital investment.\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, surging by over 6% in November before declining around 10% in December. However, the broader energy sector ended last year with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market. Nevertheless, the sector\u2019s performance over the past 3-year and 5-year periods remains strong.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the oil refining sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of February 18, 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Oil Refinery Stock To Invest In According to Analysts?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nStock Upside Potential: 20.95%\n\nExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. Exxon is also one of the largest refiners in the world, with nearly 5 million barrels per day of distillation capacity at 21 refineries.\n\nExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is benefiting significantly from its $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year and reported $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations in 2024 \u2013 its third-highest tally in the past decade despite weaker market conditions. The company also managed to deliver record production in the Permian and Guyana, helping triple the South American country\u2019s GDP per capita since it started production in 2020. The oil major\u2019s strong financial position has allowed it to distribute more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks in the last five years, $30 billion more than the closest competitor. Exxon maintained its record of raising its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years, increasing its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.99 per share for Q1 of 2025.\n\nExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ended 2024 with a massive cash balance of $23.2 billion. The company helped bolster its balance sheet through the divestment of the Fos-sur-Mer refinery \u2013 one of France\u2019s major refineries \u2013 and two other oil terminals to Rhone Energies in Q4.

It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve won the same title twice,\u201d a delighted Rublev said.\u201cI\u2019m really happy. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201dThe opener went with serve for the first 11 games, with Rublev serving to love on four occasions and Draper twice doing likewise, before the Russian finally broke the Briton to take the first set.The second set appeared to heading towards a tiebreak when Draper managed to break for a 6-5 lead and served out to level the match.Draper had never beaten Rublev in their three previous meetings, and went into the deciding set with the wind in his sails, but Rublev showed no mercy.Rublev broke twice early on to storm into a 5-0 lead and while Draper managed to avoid a bagel, the Russian fired down two aces to wrap up the win.\u201cI really like Jack as a person and I really like his game. He has a really, really great career and future ahead. He will win many great things,\u201d Rublev said.Draper failed in his bid to win his third ATP title after winning in Stuttgart and Vienna last year, but the 23-year-old\u2019s run to the final will lift him to a career-high 12th in the rankings.\u201cI want to congratulate Andrey. He was too good today. Outlasted me,\u201d Draper said.\u201cWe played some really tough matches this week. In the third set he was a bit too strong for me.\u201dJulian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool wasted little time adding a third tour-level title to their flourishing partnership on Saturday at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open.The pair prevailed 6-3, 6-2 in an all-British championship match against Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski in Doha to reassert their status as one of the doubles teams to watch in 2025. Cash and Glasspool, who made their team debut last September and have since lifted trophies in Tokyo in October, in Brisbane in January and now in Doha, are now up to third in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.\u201cWe really enjoyed our time here. Lloyd and I put a lot of effort in and it\u2019s kind of showing early in the year, which is nice,\u201d said Cash. \u201cHopefully we can keep improving and get some bigger titles down the road.\u201dWhen asked about prospects for the rest of 2025, Glasspool added: \u201cI try to have low expectations, honestly. Just try to keep working hard, have belief in our level and trust it, and see what happens. If you put that hard work, eventually it should hopefully show at some point.\u201dHaving opened their Doha campaign with back-to-back Match Tie-break wins, Cash and Glasspool\u2019s victory in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Salisbury and Skupski was far more straightforward. They broke serve twice in each set en route to a one-hour, one-minute win during which they won 82 per cent (33/40) of points behind their own first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats.By lifting the title in Doha, the 28-year-old Cash ensured he will on Monday rise to a career-high No 19 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings. He will join No 3 Henry Patten, No 17 Skupski and No 18 Glasspool to mark the most Britons in the Top 20 in PIF ATP Rankings history.",

I\u2019m really happy. I think both of us were really tired after two three-set matches that finished late. We were exhausted and it was difficult, but somehow we were able to play at a good level. When I lost the second set, I let it go and started to play more freely,\u201d Rublev, who collected his 17th ATP Tour title, said.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing,\u201d he said before receiving the glittering golden falcon trophy from Exxon Mobil Corporation Chairman and CEO Darren Woods in the presence of Qatar Tennis, Squash and Badminton Federation President Nasser bin Ghanim Al Khelaifi, ExxonMobil Qatar President and General Manager Taher Hamid and Tournament Director Karim Alami.\n\n\u201cI played at a good level. In some moments, I was really good mentally and didn\u2019t let frustration get over me. As soon as I was frustrated, I was able to restart again and I was able to play at the same intensity. That\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d the Russian World No. 10 said.\n\nThe match began with 11 consecutive holds of serve before Rublev broke Draper to seal the opening frame, 7-5. The second set mirrored that pattern, only this time it was Draper who earned the late break to level proceedings at a set each. With Draper challenging his title run, Rublev found his usual pace in the third set, taking a commanding 5-0 lead before Draper managed to hold serve. However, Rublev delivered a love game to wrap up the title which placed him in the class of two-time QatarExxonMobil Open winners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always special to win in Doha,\u201d said Rublev.\n\n\u201cI have amazing memories from 2020 and I\u2019m really happy to lift the trophy again. I knew Jack would fight until the end, so I had to stay focused,\u201d Rublev said.\n\nThe victory marks Rublev\u2019s first tour-level title since his ATP Masters 1000 triumph in Madrid last May and his sixth ATP 500 trophy overall.\n\nDraper said he has been enjoying an amazing week in Doha.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing week. Andrey was too good today. We played some tough matches this week and in the third set he was just a bit too strong for me. I\u2019m really proud of my efforts this week. Every day, I wake up and try to improve, so it\u2019s a testament to my hard work I suppose,\u201d Draper, who will rise to a new career high of No. 12 in the ATP Rankings tomorrow, said despite after out on his third ATP Tour title.\n\nEarlier, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool clinched their third ATP tour-level doubles title, defeating Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski 6-3, 6-2 in an all-British final.",

            "content": "Seplat Energy Plc, an indigenous oil and gas producer, is settling down to business in Akwa Ibom with its successful acquisition of the assets and liabilities of ExxonMobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited last year. It was one of the protracted corporate purchases in Nigeria\u2019s oil industry lasting well over five years. ExxonMobil had operated in the state for over 50 years (It started as Mobil and in November 1999, merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil) and had become an important part of the Akwa Ibom community until it was bought last year for $1.3 billion by Seplat. To make its presence easily felt in the state, Seplat appointed an eminent Akwa Ibom son, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, as its board chairman. Early this year, the chairman led the company on a visit to Governor Umo Eno. I congratulate Senator Udoma on his appointment and I welcome Seplat to Akwa Ibom the state. But I have a few words of advice for the company.\n\nDuring the visit to the Government House, Senator Udoma told the governor that the company is willing to partner with the government for sustainable development and would \u2018\u2019support the socio-economic development of Akwa Ibom State\u2019\u2019 and improve the wellbeing of the host communities. He said ExxonMobil was acquired by a subsidiary of Seplat known as Seplat Energy Offshore Limited, and clarified that the new entity will now be known as Seplat Energy Producing Nigeria Unlimited (SEPNU) and that all assets and liabilities of the previous company would be retained. Gov. Eno welcomed the company and promised cooperation from the government.\n\nThe specific roles and contributions of oil companies to the host communities are well spelt out in the Petroleum Industry Act and I am sure that SEPNU will do well to adhere to the provisions of this law and establish healthy relationships with its host communities in particular and Akwa Ibom State as a whole. But there are other items that I wish to bring to the notice of the company in terms of its relationship with Akwa Ibom State. First, ExxonMobil was a very responsible corporate citizen and through its conduct; it endeared itself to the people and the government. It had a lot of Akwa Ibom people in its senior management cadre. My good friend, Udom Inoyo, who is also well known to Senator Udoma, rose from a junior executive position hired in 1989 to the position of Executive Vice chairman from where he retired a few ago. There were many other Akwa Ibom sons and daughters in senior positions as geophysicists; engineers; lawyers; HR; finance; communications and IT specialists, etc.\n\nNow, these people are retiring, and I want to advise that SEPNU should replace them with other Akwa Ibom people who are qualified to hold these positions. SEPNU should not make the mistake of replacing them with people from other places with the hackneyed excuse that \u2018\u2019there\u2019s no qualified Akwa Ibom person for the job\u2019\u2019. I have heard such silly excuses from other companies, and I believe that with Senator Udoma as chairman, Seplat will not insult our people with a similar justification. In fact, SEPNU may have to draw up an affirmative action to ensure the employment of our people in all cadres; with at least two Akwa Ibom people in executive positions. There are many qualified Akwa Ibom persons and they are capable of competing for any position in the company. Akwa Ibom people will resist every attempt at cleansing out our people who were hired, trained and groomed by ExxonMobil from SEPNU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExxonMobil had also built and maintained a large pool of competent contractors and service providers from Akwa Ibom State. I imagine that SEPNU will continue to use them and add more to the list in future. In fact, it would be cost-effective for SEPNU to encourage service providers to be located close to QIT instead of mobilizing them from Warri, Lagos or Port Harcourt to its shallow water platforms. In terms of educational intervention, SEPNU should also offer generous scholarships to Akwa Ibom students at various educational institutions. ExxonMobil was also very good at this. The technical training centre built by ExxonMobil in Eket which served as a training facility for the technical staff will have to be upgraded to a full-fledged engineering centre.\n\nExxonMobil had planned to establish an engineering centre at the University of Uyo, but unfortunately, the plan was not fully realized before it exited the State. An engineering centre is relevant for the Nigerian oil industry as a training facility for the core professionals in civil, mechanical, petroleum and alternative energy engineering. SEPNU may wish to go ahead and either upgrade the training centre to an engineering centre or complete the one ExxonMobil was planning to build at UniUyo as well as continue with the trauma centre it was planning for the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital.\n\nThe location of ExxonMobil\u2019s corporate headquarters in Lagos was a major concern to the Akwa Ibom people and the state government. The company resisted pressures from successive governors to relocate to Akwa Ibom despite the incentives and conducive business environment the state offers. As a renowned corporate lawyer, Senator Udoma understands the intricacies of oil politics and he\u2019s in a position to guide Seplat on the issue of headquarters location. Seplat will do well to respect the people; interests and cultures of our people and work to establish mutually beneficial relationships with the people and their government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a word for the host communities and the state government. Undoubtedly, they have their respective roles in making a success of Seplat\u2019s entry to the state. While the PIA authorizes oil companies to pay royalties directly to the host communities, it is the responsibility of the host communities to manage these funds efficiently, and transparently and develop the communities. The monies are not to be shared among community leaders.\n\nThe state government is expected to deploy tax revenues and contributions from the oil company to create an enabling environment for the growth of business. I recall that in 2011, ExxonMobil paid N8 billion to the Akwa Ibom government when Godswill Akpabio was governor as its contribution to the repairs and expansion of Eket-Ibeno Road. But quite curiously, the Udom Emmanuel administration that succeeded Akpabio later denied that the money was paid. The denial created quite a furore and resulted in an unfortunate and needless controversy which embarrassed our people, including Akwa Ibom executives in the company. It was enough to discourage future CSR initiatives from the company. The government has a responsibility to manage its resources responsibly and transparently to earn the confidence of the citizens and investors.\n\nI\u2019m pleased at the appointment of Senator Udoma as the Chairman of Seplat. In 2021, I put him and 12 other persons on the cover of my book on the struggle for the abrogation of the onshore-offshore oil dichotomy. As a senator between 1999 and 2007, he fought hard to ensure the abrogation of the obnoxious dichotomy and with that, Akwa Ibom has been receiving billions every month in oil revenues. Senator Udoma is one of the most upright; decent and honest Nigerians. I\u2019m sure that he will protect our interests.",

            "content": "Global Oil Trade Shifts Dramatically Amid Sanctions Russia pivots to Asia as Kazakhstan faces export declines and Exxon pushes gas output from Guyana.\n\nThe global oil market is undergoing seismic shifts as sanctions and geopolitical tensions reshape trade relationships. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country has seen significant changes, particularly in how it engages with international markets. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), nearly 50% of Russia's energy exports once flowed to European nations. Yet, by the end of 2023, this figure had plummeted, with China and India now standing as the foremost importers of Russian oil.\n\nData indicates China has skyrocketed to claim 32.7% of Russia\u2019s exports, followed closely by India at 16.8%. Prior to the invasion, China accounted for just 14.6% and India only 1.56%. This unprecedented pivot demonstrates the stark decline of European dependency, with their combined share now barely hitting 15%. Zsolt Darvas from the Bruegel Institute notes, \u201cThere was a major diversion of trade away from the West to these countries.\u201d\n\nThe ramifications are notable. Since the invasion, EU and Western purchases of Russian crude plunged by 90%, leading to increased reliance on Asian markets. A considerable amount of this oil is reportedly routed through what is often referred to as Russia's \"shadow fleet,\" ships not covered by standard maritime insurance. This fleet's operation makes it difficult to fully account for Russia's oil exports, but estimates show at least 70% of crude exports travel this route. Nations like China, India, and Turkey now account for nearly all of Russia\u2019s oil sales.\n\nElina Ribakova from the Peterson Institute for International Economics starkly describes the transformation, stating, \u201cRussia is now China\u2019s vassal.\u201d This unbalanced relationship means Beijing holds significant leverage over Moscow. Darvas elaborates on this point, noting, \u201cRussia is a big country but it doesn't have the capacity to be self-sufficient... So, it must obtain these products from somewhere else. And increasingly, that's China.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kazakhstan's oil export outlook has also dimmed, as the country prepares for declines in its 2024 exports due to domestic regulatory pressures and geopolitical shifts. Observers note the changes are reflective of larger trends impacting Central Asia, complicated by reduced Russian oil supply. This evolution is particularly concerning as demand for oil continues to rise globally, but Kazakhstan's government calls for heightened domestic production.\n\nTurning its gaze to the Americas, Exxon Mobil is aiming to ramp up natural gas output from its oil development projects based off the coast of Guyana. The company\u2019s strategic pivot points to significant potential for gas exports, promising to transform the region\u2019s energy dynamics. Alistair Routledge from Exxon expressed optimism, detailing plans for their \u201cWales Gas Vision,\u201d which envisions utilizing gas from offshore developments for domestic fertilizer production and powering data centers.\n\n\u201cThere is still the possibility of using liquefied natural gas technology connectors to global markets,\u201d indicated Routledge, addressing the feasibility of exporting Guyanese gas. This forward-thinking scenario aims to bring online significant production capacities by 2029, potentially reaching up to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.\n\nThe interplay between these developments showcases significant changes occurring within global oil markets amid shifting political landscapes. The advent of new partnerships between countries like China and Russia signifies not only the effectiveness of sanctions but also how they have inadvertently created dependencies. For Kazakhstan, the challenge remains to navigate these tumultuous waters of export declines, all whilst attempting to bolster national energy goals.\n\nOverall, the future of global oil trade appears influenced by the United States' pivot away from Russian energy sources, prompting countries previously dependent on Russian exports to reassess their strategies. The rising significance of Asian markets poses new challenges and opportunities alike. With both caution and optimistic projections, nations adapt to this new reality. The foundations for future trade dynamics are being laid, and it will be interesting to observe how these relationships evolve and impact global markets.",

            "content": "If the goal is to accelerate environmental devastation, lay off thousands of workers, and cement Big Oil\u2019s death grip on global energy policy, then sure\u2014go right ahead.\n\nNothing screams \u201cbrighter future\u201d like two of the UK\u2019s most notorious polluters joining forces to double down on destruction. That\u2019s right\u2014some investment bankers and analysts, never ones to let a good environmental catastrophe go to waste, are floating the idea of a BP-Shell merger. The goal? To create a \u201cnational champion\u201d capable of competing with the likes of France\u2019s TotalEnergies and American titans ExxonMobil and Chevron. Because, obviously, the world needs another corporate Goliath ramping up oil extraction while sprinkling in just enough greenwashing to keep up appearances.\n\nA Behemoth of Greed and Emissions\n\nAccording to The Mail\u2019s Mark Shapland, a BP-Shell mega-merger would create a \u201cbehemoth\u201d with 180,000 employees and the scale to slash costs. Translation? Mass layoffs, cost-cutting, and a glorious race to the bottom for environmental and safety standards. Meanwhile, Shell\u2014gloriously steered by CEO Wael Sawan\u2014has gone \u201cfrom strength to strength\u201d (read: even bigger profits, even more pollution), while BP\u2019s Murray Auchincloss is clinging to his last shred of credibility. With activist investor Elliott Management circling like a vulture, BP\u2019s leadership is scrambling to keep shareholders happy. Merging with Shell might just be their Hail Mary play.\n\nThe \u201cBrilliant\u201d Business Case: Doubling Down on Destruction\n\nBreakingviews\u2019 Yawen Chen argues that merging BP and Shell might not be entirely insane. Even modest cost-cutting measures could supposedly add $33 billion to the value of the combined group\u2014because the best way to improve a struggling company is to merge it with another ageing fossil-fuel dinosaur. Of course, pesky details like regulatory hurdles, job losses, and corporate culture clashes might make things a bit complicated. Competition authorities would demand disposals in retail sites, aviation supply, and lubricants\u2014because nothing says \u201cnational champion\u201d like carving up your own empire to get the deal approved.\n\nBP: A Company in Freefall\n\nBP\u2019s descent into \u201ctakeover territory\u201d is a tragicomedy of its own making. The grand \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d pivot under former CEO Bernard Looney\u2014slashing oil and gas production by 40% while promising 50 gigawatts of renewables by 2030\u2014sent investors running for the hills. Auchincloss has since tried to undo some of that damage, but not fast enough for BP\u2019s shareholders, who remain unimpressed. Cue Elliott Management, now holding a 5% stake and demanding a full-throttle return to oil and gas.\n\nThe Bottom Line? More Fossil Fuels, More Chaos\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Ben Marlow, BP\u2019s half-hearted approach to dropping its green commitments while still throwing \u201cbillions of pounds\u201d at renewables has left it stuck in corporate purgatory. Its debt levels are sky-high, and with no cash to pacify investors with dividends and buybacks, everything\u2014including a possible breakup\u2014is on the table. Bloomberg\u2019s Chris Hughes notes that Elliott\u2019s strategy of gutting BP\u2019s renewables division and focusing on oil might offer a quick fix for the share price, but it\u2019s a myopic move that ignores the long-term risks of, well, the planet burning.\n\nInvestors Laughing All the Way to the Bank\n\nAnd who benefits from this financial circus? BP and Shell\u2019s biggest investors, of course. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street\u2014those ever-present overlords of global finance\u2014are more than happy to keep bankrolling climate collapse as long as the returns keep rolling in. Because, in the grand scheme of things, what\u2019s a little global catastrophe compared to another quarter of record-breaking profits?\n\nSo, should BP and Shell merge? If the goal is to accelerate environmental devastation, lay off thousands of workers, and cement Big Oil\u2019s death grip on global energy policy, then sure\u2014go right ahead. But let\u2019s drop the pretence that this is about \u201cnational strength\u201d or \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d This is about one thing only: profit at any cost.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best very cheap stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe stock market had a mixed start to 2025 as the Chinese Deepseek AI model has put the U.S. AI giants on the back foot. However, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index made a recovery after taking a hit and has surged over 5% year-to-date. In addition, the S&P 500 index has gained just over 4% so far in 2025.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Cheap Technology Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nGoldman Sachs Research\u2019s chief US equity strategist, David Kostin, expects the US tariffs to negatively impact the S&P 500 EPS in 2025. Kostin cited that every five-percentage-point increase in the US tariff rate will reduce S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1-2%.\n\nIf the U.S. administration continues with the proposed tariff rates, a 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China would reduce S&P 500 EPS forecasts by approximately 2-3%, as per Goldman\u2019s Research.\n\nWith the potential market risks and tariff threat from the Trump administration, cheap stocks with strong fundamentals can be a good option for investment.\n\nAt first glance, the market may seem overvalued, with the S&P 500 trading close to all-time highs, driven by tech giants and leading consumer stocks. However, some stocks have missed the broader market rally amid temporary challenges. These stocks have attractive forward P/E ratios and proven growth records.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Finviz screener to compile a list of 30 cheap stocks with a forward P/E ratio of under 15. We shortlisted the 10 best very cheap stocks to buy now based on the highest potential upside according to average analyst estimate, as of February 17. The very cheap stocks are ranked in ascending order of the average analyst upside.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nP/E Ratio: 13.74\n\nAverage Analysts Upside: 17.91%\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world\u2019s leading oil and gas companies. It is engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of petroleum products.\n\nOn February 10, Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett kept a Buy rating on XOM shares with a price target of $144. The analyst sees Exxon Mobil Corporation\u2019s core business evolving with a focus on low-carbon solutions, which shows the company\u2019s foresight and adaptability in a changing energy landscape. As part of Exxon\u2019s 2030 strategy, it plans to allocate up to $30 billion toward low-emission projects between 2025 and 2030. The company is working in collaboration with the Texas General Land Office to secure the largest offshore carbon dioxide storage site in the U.S. The company is also making developments in establishing the largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility, which is anticipated to generate over 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day.\n\nSince 2019, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has gathered around $12.1 billion in Structural Cost Savings, exceeding its peers and overcoming inflation. With a remarkable record of paying dividends for 54 consecutive years and a current dividend yield of 4.27%, Exxon Mobil Corporation reflects strong financial stability.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 9th on our list of best very cheap stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Exxon recently kicked off the process of seeking environmental permits for its eighth project in Guyana, the first that will generate gas not linked to oil production. Exxon is also looking to explore another well at its massive offshore block, the head of the U.S. oil major in Guyana revealed last week. Exxon is getting ready for what promises to be a very active year for exploration and production in Guyana following upgrades that increased the capacity of two of its three floating facilities.\n\nLast year, Netherlands-based SBM Offshore (OTCPK:SBFFF) (OTCPK:SBFFY) completed the $1.23B sale of its fifth floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) unit to Exxon for use in offshore Guyana. With a production capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day, the FPSO Jaguar has a daily associated gas treatment capacity of 540 million cubic feet and a water injection capacity of 300,000 barrels per day. According to Exxon, the project will significantly reduce the cost of electricity in Guyana. The proposed project would bring associated gas from ExxonMobil Guyana-operated projects offshore (Liza Phase 1 and 2) via pipeline to onshore gas processing facilities. The pipeline would transport up to ~50 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas to the facilities.\n\nIn November, Exxon announced that it has reached 500M barrels of oil produced from Guyana's offshore Stabroek block, just five years after it kicked off production at the location. According to the company, the first three projects--Liza Phase 1, Liza Phase 2 and Payara--are already pumping more than 650K bbl/day. The Exxon-led consortium which includes Hess Corp. (NYSE:HES) and China's Cnooc (OTCPK:CEOHF) have set a target to reach production of at least 1.3M bbl/day of oil by year-end 2027, a feat it hopes to achieve when six approved offshore projects come online. Data by the Guyana government has revealed that the consortium's agreement generated $6.33B for the partners last year, with Exxon netting $2.9B, Hess earning $1.88B, while Cnooc amassed $1.52B from Stabroek. Exxon Mobil owns 45% of the Stabroek block; Hess 30% while Cnooc owns a 25% stake.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, the global economy in 2025 is expected to face some tough challenges, with growth forecasts looking modest \u2013 the US GDP at 2.0%, the Eurozone at 0.9%, and China at 4.2%. Inflation may persist due to higher fiscal spending and potential tariff hikes, which could limit central banks\u2019 ability to lower interest rates. This could in turn lead to more market volatility. Productivity has been growing slowly, and in some cases, it has even declined, affecting long-term living standards. However, AI and new technologies could help drive productivity higher, though it will take time to see noticeable results.\n\nDespite these challenges, 2025 will be about navigating turbulent times, with a clear gap between the high-tech, high-productivity US economy and Europe, which is lagging behind. Policy focus is shifting from monetary to fiscal, with China taking the lead on new initiatives. Stocks, especially in the United States, remain a strong opportunity for growth, while European equities offer potential despite economic struggles.\n\nIn Q4 2024, S&P Global reported that US domestic stocks saw a net dividend increase of $11.7 billion, which was lower than the $13.7 billion increase in the same quarter last year. Overall, dividend increases totaled $14.2 billion for the quarter, which was down from $17.5 billion in Q4 2023. For the entire year, dividends grew by $53.3 billion, a significant jump from the previous year\u2019s $36.5 billion. On a per-share basis, the broader market\u2019s dividends hit a record, growing by 6% to $19.81 per share. In Q4 last year, there were 635 dividend increases, which is a 10.2% decrease compared to the 707 increases in Q4 2023.\n\nOver the past 12 months, total dividend increases amounted to $71.4 billion, up from $65.1 billion in the previous year. Interestingly, the number of companies cutting dividends decreased by 19.5% in Q4, with only 33 companies lowering their payouts, compared to 41 the year before. Here, we discuss some of the best cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 3% and P/E ratios under 15. We focused on picking stocks with a consistent record of paying dividends, offering dividend growth, and being financially stable to steer clear of yield traps. The list below is ranked in ascending order of the dividend yield as of February 17. We have also mentioned the P/E ratios and hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nDividend Yield as of February 17: 3.66%\n\nP/E Ratio: 13.49\n\nAmerican energy titan Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands 10th on our list of the best dividend stocks.

The Longtail project, launching in 2030, will add 250,000 bpd of oil and 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day.\n\nOver the past five years, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has grown earnings at an average annual rate of nearly 30%. In 2024 alone, the company generated $55 billion in operating cash flow, one of its best performances in a decade.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this oil and natural gas company have returned -3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which Exxon falls in, has gained 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Exxon is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of -15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.6%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.02 indicates a change of +21.4% from what Exxon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Exxon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

            "content": "The country\u2019s natural gas sector is also expected to benefit significantly from the ongoing AI boom and the accompanying data centers, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years. According to data from S&P Global Commodity Insights, if even a quarter of the projected data center load is supplied by gas-fired generation, this would translate to a 2% increase in total US gas demand in 2040.\n\nEurope remains a top destination for American liquified natural gas. The continent has had to rely significantly more on imported LNG and less on gas delivered via pipelines from Russia since the Putin government\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The American LNG sector is also set to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month to lift a freeze on new US licenses to export liquefied natural gas, making good on a campaign pledge to rescind the measure.\n\nAfter a stellar 2023, the US natural gas output slumped slightly last year due to prices falling to multi-decade lows, but production is expected to climb to 104.5 bcfd in 2025, as a period of strong demand and improved prices spark a resurgence in production. Analysts expect average annual gas prices to increase by more than 40% this year over the levels seen in 2024, as demand is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The demand surge is largely attributed to new LNG export facilities, like Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3, coming online, while the Golden Pass LNG project is also anticipated to begin operations by mid-2026.\n\nThe United States of America is the Top Natural Gas Producing Country in the World , courtesy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, notably in shale, sandstone, carbonate, and other tight geologic formations. The country\u2019s dry natural gas production reached 103.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2023, up 4.3% from 2022 and the highest for any year on record, dating back to 1930, according to 2023 Natural Gas Annual. The US was also a net exporter of natural gas for the seventh consecutive year in 2023, transporting gas to 42 countries during the year.\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Natural Gas Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best natural gas stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe energy sector has witnessed considerable fluctuations over the last few months, surging by over 6% in November before declining around 10% in December. However, the broader energy sector (roughly 1/3rd of which is made up of natural gas companies) ended last year with a return of just 5.72%, significantly lagging behind gains of 25% by the wider market.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the natural gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 of 2024. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year. Following are the Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Natural Gas Stock To Buy Now?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nTopping our list of the Best Natural Gas Stocks to Invest in is Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world with operations in more than 60 countries.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in a massive $59.5 billion all-stock deal last year. The venture seems to be paying off as the oil major achieved record production in Permian and Guyana and delivered an industry-leading financial performance in 2024, reporting over $33 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations. Exxon\u2019s strong balance sheet allowed it to pay $16.7 billion in dividends and buy back $19.3 billion in stock, reaffirming its plans to spend $20 billion on buybacks per year through at least 2026.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced in December 2024 that its annual project spending will rise to between $28 billion and $33 billion between 2026 and 2030, with a goal of increasing its oil and gas output by 18%. The company has a target of more than tripling its production in the Permian and producing 1.3 million bpd from its highly lucrative operations in Guyana. As a result, XOM is expecting to deliver incremental growth potential of $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by the end of the decade, allowing it to keep its commitment to sustainable, competitive, and growing shareholder returns.\n\nAntero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) has surged by over 80% over the last year, putting it among the 12 Hot Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of best natural gas stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

After Global X launched the first global broad-based index exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Australia using the GARP framework in September 2024, the strategy delivered strong early-stage performance. According to a Global X report, while global equity markets experienced a rally towards the end of 2024, the GARP stocks outperformed the broader market and other factors like quality, rising approximately 20% since the ETF's launch. The report also noted that GARP's success wasn't driven by technology, but rather by broader sectors such as consumer goods, financials, and communication.\n\nThe GARP strategy, popularized by Peter Lynch, aims to strike a balance between growth and value investing by avoiding the extremes of either approach. It focuses on finding growth stocks that have relatively low price-to-earnings ratios under typical market conditions. When these stocks are identified successfully, they can offer strong returns for investors. Historically, the GARP Index has outperformed its benchmark by tracking companies that demonstrate consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuations, and strong earnings potential.\n\nOver the past year, the market has highlighted the importance of diversifying portfolios to manage risk. Selecting stocks that perform well under various economic conditions has consistently been a challenge for investors, as strategies that work in one market may not work in another. For instance, growth and value stocks have shown different performance trends in various market conditions, making both approaches appealing to investors. Combining elements of both strategies can provide a refreshing alternative to traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes into play. Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) is an investment strategy that focuses on finding companies with strong, sustainable earnings growth and appealing valuations in relation to their growth potential. These companies are often in sectors with positive growth trends or have competitive advantages that position them for future success.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the market, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that the GARP Index delivered an average annual return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 9.81% growth. Over the same period, the market\u2019s Growth Index and the Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also highlighted that the GARP Index achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to both the growth and value indices during this time frame.\n\nA CNBC report also highlighted insights from BMO\u2019s analysts regarding investment strategies to navigate market uncertainties in the U.S. According to the report, investors should consider the GARP approach alongside dividend growth strategies in the current financial landscape. Dividend stocks have historically performed well during inflationary periods, making them a favored choice among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this article, we used the GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked 10 dividend companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Exxon Mobil Corporation ( NYSE:XOM ) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nThe US$129 analyst price target for XOM is 19% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$41b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.8%) = US$904b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$904b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$440b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$698b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$108, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\n\nNYSE:XOM Discounted Cash Flow February 15th 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exxon Mobil as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.087. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

            "content": "Nothing Says \u201cSustainable Business\u201d Like an Earthquake Every Few Months\n\nIt\u2019s another day, another earthquake in Groningen, where decades of reckless gas extraction by Shell and ExxonMobil\u2019s joint venture, NAM, have left the ground as unstable as their ethical standards. This time, a 2.2 magnitude quake hit the town of Usquert just after midnight, shaking homes, rattling windows, and waking residents with a hard, dull thud. Coincidentally, that\u2019s also the sound of Shell executives ignoring accountability.\n\n\u201cInduced Earthquakes\u201d: Just a Fancy Term for Corporate Destruction\n\nThe KNMI meteorological institute wasted no time in confirming what everyone already knew: this was an \u201cinduced earthquake,\u201d meaning it wasn\u2019t some random act of nature\u2014it was a direct consequence of Shell and ExxonMobil sucking every last drop of gas from the earth, leaving behind a crumbling foundation.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, no injuries were reported\u2014unless, of course, you count the tens of thousands of residents who\u2019ve seen their homes crack, their walls crumble, and their communities turned into an unstable mess.\n\nProfits Over People: The Groningen Story\n\nSince gas extraction began in the Slochteren gas field in 1963, the Dutch state has pocketed \u20ac360 billion in revenue, while Shell and ExxonMobil, co-owners of NAM, have casually split another \u20ac66 billion.\n\nAnd what did the people of Groningen get? 1,600 earthquakes and 85,000 damaged buildings. That\u2019s right\u2014tens of thousands of homes cracked like eggshells while Shell, Exxon, and the Dutch government cashed in on the region\u2019s destruction.\n\nAnjo de Haan from Warffum told RTV Noord: \u201cThe quake woke me up. There was a dull, hard knock, and the windows and doors shook.\u201d\n\nDull, hard knocks? Sounds a lot like every single investigation into Shell\u2019s conduct.\n\nShell\u2019s Classic Strategy: Extract, Destroy, Deny\n\nYou\u2019d think after six decades of seismic destruction, someone would step in to stop this. But no, the Groningen gas field was only shut down last year, and even then, Shell and the Dutch government are still eyeing more gas extraction in the Warffum region. Because when you\u2019ve already made tens of billions from turning an entire province into a geological disaster zone, why stop now?\n\nAnd if history tells us anything, Shell will spend more time spying on activists (hello, Hakluyt!) than actually compensating the people whose homes they\u2019ve ruined.\n\nA Parliamentary Slap on the Wrist\n\nIn 2023, a Dutch parliamentary commission finally admitted what everyone knew all along: Groningen\u2019s residents had been systematically ignored by both the government and energy companies for decades. Groundbreaking revelation, right? In response, the government pledged \u20ac22 billion over the next 30 years for compensation measures\u2014a fraction of the \u20ac426 billion this operation has generated.\n\nTranslation: \u201cHere\u2019s some pocket change, now stop complaining.\u201d\n\nThe Bottom Line? Groningen Will Keep Shaking Until Shell Stops Drilling\n\nThe people of Groningen have paid the price for Shell\u2019s greed with their homes, safety, and peace of mind. But Shell\u2019s biggest investors, like BlackRock and Vanguard, aren\u2019t complaining\u2014as long as the profits keep rolling in, who cares if a few more homes collapse?\n\nSo, what\u2019s next? Another earthquake next month? More government inaction? Shell shifting the blame to someone else while collecting another fat paycheck? All of the above.\n\nBecause when it comes to corporate destruction, Shell never stops drilling\u2014even when the ground starts falling apart.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nThis website and sisters royaldutchshellgroup.com johndonovan.website , and shellnews.net , are owned by John Donovan .

            "content": "\u201cWe would never tell a company what its dividend should or should not be. Instead, we prefer to afford the management teams of companies in which we invest the space and the confidence to cut their dividend if they feel it is unsustainable or the money is better spent elsewhere. Far better it takes that approach than overstretch its balance sheet to pay a dividend it cannot afford.\u201d\n\nWhile a dividend cut poses a risk, it can also create opportunities. Short-term investors focused solely on high dividends often sell their shares when a company reduces its payout. This can open the door for long-term, value-oriented investors to purchase shares at more attractive prices. Simon Adler, value equity fund manager at Schroders, made the following comment about this:\n\nThe year 2020 served as a significant test of dividend durability among these companies. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March, consumer demand in several industries declined sharply. As a result, numerous companies either cut or suspended their dividends, some voluntarily and others as a condition of accepting government stimulus funds. By the end of 2020, a total of 66 companies in the broader market had distributed less in dividends than they had in 2019, according to a report by Morningstar.\n\nA company\u2019s history of annual dividend increases, regardless of its length, does not guarantee that future payouts are secure. However, when management frequently highlights these streaks in earnings calls and annual reports, it suggests a strong commitment to maintaining and growing dividends when making capital allocation decisions. Even so, history shows that some Dividend Aristocrats have had to reduce their payouts, leading to their removal from the list.\n\nDividend Aristocrats refer to companies with a strong track record of increasing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. These stocks are often favored by investors due to their reputation as dependable sources of income. A company\u2019s ability to raise dividends consistently over decades is considered an indicator of financial resilience and stability. In addition, these stocks have demonstrated strong long-term performance, often surpassing other asset classes. According to a ProShares report citing FactSet data, the Dividend Aristocrat Index delivered a notable return of 27.7% between March 2022 and April 2023, outperforming the broader market, which posted a 25.2% return over the same period.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other cheapest dividend aristocrats to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend-paying stocks are often linked to value investing, as they typically offer higher yields and stronger financial fundamentals compared to growth stocks. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices noted that income-focused investment strategies tend to exhibit characteristics associated with value stocks. Companies with high dividend yields and lower valuations frequently draw investor interest. However, the report also highlighted that the Dividend Aristocrats Index is not strictly value-focused. Instead, it maintains a balance between growth and value stocks. A long-term analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 showed that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings fell into the value category, while 40.94% were classified as growth stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the Dividend Aristocrats, the stocks that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. From this group, we identified 10 stocks with the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. The chosen stocks featured in the list exhibit a forward P/E ratio below 25 as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their P/E ratios.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, the U.S.-based oil and gas giant, and its consortium partners, including Hess Corporation and CNOOC, have sought environmental permits from Guyana regarding new exploration projects in the region. ExxonMobil is gearing up for its eighth project in Guyana, known as the Longtail project, which will be the first one to produce gas that is not tied to oil production. Further, the energy giant has requested permits for the exploration of the Hamlet well in the prolific Starbroek Block offshore Guyana.\n\nThe company plans to boost its production capacity in Guyana to 940,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year. The production is anticipated to increase after the company completes upgrading two of its three floating oil production units and the fourth floating production vessel arrives in the region. The entire oil production in Guyana is managed by the ExxonMobil-led consortium. The consortium plans to ramp up production levels in the South American nation to more than 1.7 million bpd by the end of 2029.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s fourth project in Guyana, Yellowtail, is scheduled to come onstream soon after the arrival of the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility, constructed by SBM Offshore. The other projects, namely Uaru, Whiptail and Hammerhead, are expected to start between 2026 and 2029. The Longtail project is expected to raise the consortium\u2019s production capacity by adding up to 250,000 bpd of crude and 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day.\n\nThe consortium also recently concluded an appraisal of its gas reserves that was long due. The study should help them evaluate the total amount of resources available for production accurately. A company spokesperson noted that the data gathered during the study will be fed into geological models and reservoir models. These models are intended to help XOM understand the kind of development that might be feasible for these resources. The findings from ExxonMobil\u2019s study could also support a large development contract awarded to Fulcrum LNG by Guyana for the construction of the nation's first LNG project.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank and Key Picks\n\nXOM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the energy sector are SM Energy SM, Sunoco LP SUN and Archrock Inc.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "XOM's total revenue for 2024 was $339.25 billion, reflecting a 1.5% decrease from the previous year, while Chevron's total revenue for the same year stood at $202.79 billion, excluding the HESS merger.\n\nFinancially, we demonstrated our steadily improving earnings power across a range of metrics. We delivered earnings of $34 billion in 2024, our third highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. Over five years, we've grown earnings, excluding identified items, a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 30%. We generated cash flow from operations at $55 billion, also our third highest in a decade to fund profitable growth, maintain our financial strength and reward shareholders.\n\nFrom the perspective of a savvy investor, both companies stand out as top choices in the oil and gas industry. However, there are some differences between them. Chevron is regarded as more stable, known for its consistent returns and lower volatility. In contrast, ExxonMobil adopts a more aggressive strategy that is more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. For those who cannot afford to invest in both, my analysis will help you choose the one that suits you best. I will provide a detailed analysis of Chevron following this article about ExxonMobil.\n\nAnalyzing Exxon Mobil without mentioning Chevron Corporation ( NYSE:CVX ) would be a significant error. ExxonMobil and Chevron have similar valuations, are in the same oil and gas industry, and pay attractive dividends (4.6% for Chevron, while ExxonMobil's is 3.7%). Chevron is ranked 28th in the S&P 500 and is a dividend aristocrat as well.\n\nHowever, the upstream operations are the primary focus, generating approximately 83% of the company's total earnings in 4Q24, as shown in the graph below:\n\nExxon Mobil is a leading oil supermajor, ranked 15th in the S&P 500. It is known for consistently increasing its dividends annually, making it a dividend aristocrat. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the quarterly dividend was raised by 4.2% from the previous quarter, reaching $0.99 per share. This increase, which is above the average market rate, translates to a yield of 3.7%, a significant return for investors.ExxonMobil operates in three main segments: upstream (oil and gas production), downstream, and chemicals, including specialty products. The company is also developing low-carbon solutions and emerging energy sources.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced its earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 on January 31, 2025. This article updates my previous article published on Gurufocus on February 21, 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nUpon analyzing the one-year chart below, we can see that XOM has been performing slightly better over time. Despite some recent weaknesses, both stocks have managed to increase by single digits over the past year. This situation may change in 2025.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\n2: XOM and CVX have a long history of successful mergers and acquisitions, a testament to their strategic prowess.A brief history of ExxonMobil and Chevron mergers:\n\nOn November 30, 1999, Exxon and Mobil merged to form ExxonMobil. In 2001, Chevron acquired Texaco, followed by Unocal in 2005. ExxonMobil has recently completed its merger with Pioneer Natural Resources, while Chevron is currently merging with Hess Corporation (HES).\n\nThe proposed merger between Chevron and Hess, valued at $53 billion, is experiencing delays because of concerns raised by ExxonMobil and CNOOC regarding alleged preemptive rights associated with the joint operating agreement for the Stabroek Block in Guyana. ExxonMobil's block operator holds a 45% interest, while CNOOC has 25%. Hess holds a 30% interest in this block. The merger is currently paused until the ongoing arbitration proceedings before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) are satisfactorily resolved.In the fourth quarter of 2024, ExxonMobil's oil production in Guyana reached approximately 650,000 barrels per day, driven by its three major projects: Liza Phase 1, Liza Phase 2, and Payara. The Yellowtail project, which is the fourth in the series, is set to commence production by the end of 2025, with an expected output of 250,000 barrels per day. Additionally, three more projectsUaru, Hammerhead, and Longtailare projected to start production by 2030.\n\nThe merger of ExxonMobil and Pioneer has resulted in approximately a 16% increase in oil equivalent production year over year, or 4,602,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd). However, comparing last year's production to this quarter's production may not be advisable, as it could lead to inaccuracies.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nCurrently, ExxonMobil is producing a record of 2,011,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) in the U.S. alone, which represents a significant increase compared to last year's production of 1,228,000 Boepd.\n\nUS oil production was 1,468,000 barrels of oil per day and 543,000 oil equivalent barrels per day (natural gas production) or 8,331 million cubic feet per day (Mmcf/d). Below is the detailed production of crude oil and liquids versus natural gas per region.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nPioneer Natural Resources focused exclusively on the Permian Basin, specifically in the Midland sub-basin. ExxonMobil acquired Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-share deal valued at $64.5 billion on May 3, 2024.\n\nOne emerging issue is that ExxonMobil is producing a substantial amount of oil and gas in Canada and other Americas (Guyana for one), as shown in the chart above. The recent tariff on Canadian oil imports may lead to higher costs for ExxonMobil's Canadian operations, particularly if the company exports a significant portion of its oil production to the United States. The U.S. depends on Canadian oil, shipping approximately 60% of its oil imports from Canada. This situation means that ExxonMobil will encounter additional costs, which could impact profit margins and, ultimately, contribute to inflationary pressure in the U.S.\n\n3: A critical analysis of the fourth quarter results: Concerns about the future outlook caused the stock to decline.\n\nThe results for the Upstream segment were relatively strong, showing an increase of 56.6% year over year, primarily due to the merger with Pioneer. However, the market responded negatively to ExxonMobil's earnings from gasoline and diesel production, which saw a significant decline. Earnings in this segment dropped from $3.207 billion the previous year to just $323 million, reflecting weaker refining margins.\n\nAdditionally, total revenue fell short of expectations at $83.426 billion in 4Q24, indicating a concerning trend of revenue decline over the last three quarters, particularly in the downstream and chemicals segments, as illustrated below.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nThe decline in stock prices is primarily due to concerns about global fuel demand for 2025. Additionally, the U.S. policy of imposing tariffs on oil imports from China and other countries, including Canada, Mexico, and potentially Europe, may also be contributing to this decline or will soon. These tariffs are likely to raise domestic fuel prices and disrupt established trade flows.\n\nI believe tariff policy is a poor strategy and will negatively impact the global economy. It is the primary reason why I feel cautious about 2025 and recommend taking profits on any uptick.ExxonMobil's oil and gas prices have been decreasing, yet they have remained above $61 per barrel in the U.S., which is the average global price received by XOM since 2015. However, the overall trend is concerning, and any further decline in 2025 could negatively impact XOM.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nOne effective way to evaluate a business is by examining its free cash flow. Despite facing challenges such as weaker refining margins and decreased global fuel demand, particularly in China, ExxonMobil is still generating a robust free cash flow, which I estimate to be approximately $5.39 billion. The company reported a free cash flow of $7.997 billion, which is significantly higher than my estimation. The reason for this discrepancy is easy to explain.\n\nXOM is not using the basic formula for FCF, which is cash from operations ($12.229 billion) minus CapEx ($6.837 billion). The company adds additional investments and advances, other investing activities including the collection of advances, proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments, and inflows from noncontrolling interest for major projects and deducts additional investments and advances, which unnecessarily complicates the free cash flow. However, XOM is generating healthy free cash flow, which should cover dividends, share buybacks, and provide some extra for debt reduction as shown in the chart below:\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nOne concern is that ExxonMobil has committed to a $20 billion share buyback in 2025, which seems excessively high to me. With 4.413 billion shares outstanding diluted and a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share, the quarterly dividend expense amounts to $4.4 billion. If we add approximately $5 billion per quarter for the share buyback, it's clear that the company does not have enough free cash flow to support such spending and will likely need to increase its debt.XOM's long-term debt, including current liabilities, is $41.71 billion, while its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities total $23.03 billion. Cash is declining rapidly from $31.54 billion in 4Q23.\n\nThis calculation clearly demonstrates weaknesses in the business model and how the situation could quickly worsen if oil prices drop below $60 with increased costs due to a tariff war.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\n4: Technical Analysis. XOM is weakening.\n\nExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025\n\nNote that the chart above has been updated to reflect dividends.\n\nExxon Mobil follows a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $110.50 and support at $103.50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 47 and declining, indicating strong resistance at $103.50 and a potential downside target of $100 or lower. The stock will continue channeling downward until it breaks through the upper or lower trend line.\n\nFor a short-term trading strategy, consider taking profits between $108.50 and $111.40, with a possible higher resistance at $114, corresponding to the 200-day moving average. Conversely, I recommend accumulating shares between $105.50 and $103, with an additional lower support level at $100 or below.\n\nI suggest implementing a short-term Last In, First Out (LIFO) approach for 50% to 60% of your total position while maintaining a core long-term holding for a higher target. XOM offers a good dividend, and despite potential short-term downside risks, which you could use to average down, your investment will likely yield significant long-term gains if you remain patient.\n\nIt is also important to note that the chart above should be updated regularly to remain relevant.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

But this did not sit well with investors for some reason, who sent shares slipping modestly downward in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nExxon Mobil is at the tip of the spear on this one, but there is, reports note, an entire consortium of producers looking to get new environmental permits out of the Guyanan government for an eighth project in the region. This one will focus on natural gas generation that is not immediately connected to oil production, as well as one to explore another well in its substantial territory.\n\nExxon Mobil has already been active in the production field, having bolstered two of the three floating facilities it has in operation down there. It also plans to bring a fourth vessel online, which would boost its total production to close to 940,000 barrels per day. The good news here is that the Guyanan government has been actively pressing Exxon Mobil for more natural gas production, as it wants the material for electrical power generation.\n\nColorado Lawsuit\n\nBut the picture is not totally rosy for Exxon Mobil. The Colorado Supreme Court just heard arguments yesterday about plans for Boulder County to sue Exxon Mobil for \u201c\u2026allegedly misleading the public about the threats presented by climate change.\u201d This case goes all the way back to 2018, and looks for Exxon to pay damages for things like floods and wildfires. How the court plans to pin those charges directly on Exxon, meanwhile, is unclear.\n\nExxon has been trying to get the case moved to federal court pretty much since its inception, but the Supreme Court turned down a hearing for the case. And the Boulder District Court turned down attempts to dismiss the case as well. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court is taking it on, and should it not revoke the district court ruling, then the trial may be about to begin.\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on XOM stock based on 14 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 9.64% rally in its share price over the past year, the average XOM price target of $133.88 per share implies 23.88% upside potential.\n\nSee more XOM analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.\n\nBefore we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.\n\nHaving given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in XOM positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:\n\nIn terms of shares owned, we count 4 of the above funds having increased existing XOM positions from 09/30/2024 to 12/31/2024, with 3 having decreased their positions. Worth noting is that Providence Capital Advisors LLC, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited XOM common stock as of 12/31/2024.\n\nLooking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the XOM share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held XOM at the 12/31/2024 reporting period (out of the 4,680 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of XOM shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2024 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for XOM. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 361,894 shares in the aggregate, from 1,255,032,938 down to 1,254,671,044 for a share count decline of approximately -0.03%. The overall top three funds holding XOM on 12/31/2024 were:\n\nWe'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods. While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Exxon Mobil Corp (Symbol: XOM).\n\n10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\n\u0095 LOAR Historical Stock Prices\n\n\u0095 RTG Videos\n\n\u0095 FRT Next Dividend Date\n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "The American LNG sector is expected to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month for the country to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects, reversing a pause on permits for new projects that former President Joe Biden put in place early last year to study the environmental and economic effects of the booming export industry. Several key LNG importers from Asia have hailed the move as a necessary step for maintaining their energy security and decarbonizing their energy systems in the long run. Even just a few days ago, after a round of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump announced that Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of new shipments of American LNG.\n\nAnother point to note is that the United States is now capable of exporting LNG at such historic levels without impacting supplies to its own people. The US natural gas output stands near an all-time high and nearly 90% of it remains available for domestic consumption. At the same time, natural gas prices for American households continue to be among the lowest in the world.\n\nThe United States of America is the largest LNG exporter in the world, with 88.3 million tons shipped in 2024, up 4.5% from the previous year. Europe remains the top destination for American LNG, which has replaced nearly half of the Russian gas supply to the continent after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Although last year was marked by slow growth, these numbers are expected to receive a significant 15% boost in 2025 due to several new projects coming online, notably the Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects. These expansions could pay big dividends for the country\u2019s LNG-focused companies, given the demand grows as predicted and prices stay attractive. On their current trajectory, the ballooning LNG exports would support nearly half a million domestic jobs annually and contribute $1.3 trillion to US GDP through 2040 while having a negligible impact on domestic gas prices, according to figures from S&P Global.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been reduced to a liquid state through a process of cooling, making it easier, safer, and more efficient to store and ship around the world. The global LNG trade has skyrocketed over the last few years and reached 404 million metric tons in 2023, with demand to rise by another 50% by 2040.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Stocks to Buy in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other liquefied natural gas stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPaul Everingham, CEO of Asia Natural Gas and Energy Association (ANGEA), stated the following after the resumption of LNG export approvals in the United States:\n\n\u201cA recent study by Wood Mackenzie, commissioned by ANGEA, found that Asia\u2019s LNG demand would nearly double between now and 2050, driven largely by significant growth in demand from South and Southeast Asia. The study also forecast that the United States would make up a third of global LNG supply by 2035. However, both LNG demand growth from emerging Asia and the ability of the US to meet it, were contingent on the \u2018pause\u2019 being lifted and sufficient US supply being available in coming decades to moderate global prices and ensure that LNG was affordable for nations in South and Southeast Asia. Today\u2019s issuing by President Trump of an order to resume processing of LNG export approvals will enable key projects to proceed and give decision and policy makers in Asia the certainty they require to make long-term decisions about energy. Emerging economies in Asia seek to switch out high-emitting coal use for more gas-fired power as they pursue sensible and well-planned growth in renewable energy sources. The resumption of LNG export approvals in the US will help make this a reality.\u201d\n\nThat said, a recent headwind for the American LNG industry has emerged in the form of a burgeoning trade war between the US and China, with American gas exporters caught in the crossfire. China, the largest LNG importer in the world as well as the fastest-growing LNG market globally, was seen as a key growth market for American LNG until President Trump slapped an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports earlier this month. This move was followed by Beijing announcing its own retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US, including a 15% tariff on American LNG. Though the two countries are not highly dependent on each other in the LNG arena, with China accounting for only 5% of US LNG exports last year, these numbers are not expected to surge anytime soon if the current political landscape remains the same.\n\nA possible solution could be directing even more liquified natural gas to Europe, especially after buyers there look to replenish depleted inventories following a relatively cold winter, but that is also a short-term fix. The continent\u2019s appetite for gas is expected to decline over the long term, given its strong commitments to reduce carbon emissions by shifting to renewables.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies operating in the liquified natural gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q3 of 2024. Following are the Best LNG Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Moreover, the oil major insists that the best days are yet to come and is aiming to deliver an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by 2030. Exxon\u2019s strong financial position has allowed it to distribute more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks in the last five years, $30 billion more than the closest competitor. The company has increased its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share for Q1 of 2025.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has a goal of roughly doubling the size of its LNG business to around 40 mtpa by 2030, with projects in the United States, Papua New Guinea, Mozambique, and Qatar.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\n\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the U.S.-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nShares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+11.2% vs. +6.6%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience.\n\nWith a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the fourth quarter.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\nServiceNow shares have outperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the past year (+30.1% vs. +9.5%). The company has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation.\n\nServiceNow had 2,109 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) at the end of the fourth quarter, which represents 14% year-over-year growth in customers. ServiceNow had 19 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV. It closed 170 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) deals continued to gain traction.\n\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. Pro Plus AI grew 150% sequentially. It is riding on an expanding partner base and acquisitions. However, NOW is suffering from stiff competition and unfavorable forex.\n\n(You can read the full research report on ServiceNow here >>>)\n\nShares of Willis Lease Finance have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry over the past year (+304% vs. -7.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.32 billion has given excellent returns as the global commercial aircraft leasing market is fueled by rising air travel demand and a shift toward leasing over ownership. WLFC is well-positioned to benefit, with 81% of its $2.8 billion portfolio focused on narrowbody engines, critical for short-to-medium haul routes.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, WLFC achieved record pre-tax earnings of $122.3 million. A new $1 billion credit facility boosts liquidity for growth, while sustainability initiatives position WLFC as a leader in aviation decarbonization. Vertical integration enhances profitability, with maintenance reserve revenues up 41% and spare parts sales surging 223% year over year.\n\nHowever, headwinds include rising debt costs, supply chain disruptions, high MRO expenses, and reliance on short-term leases, which expose WLFC to cyclicality. Competitive and regulatory pressures further challenge profitability in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Willis Lease Finance here >>>)\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

            "content": "Colorado\u2019s supreme court heard arguments Tuesday in Boulder County\u2019s legal efforts to hold Exxon Mobil and Suncor Energy accountable for allegedly misleading the public about the threats presented by climate change.\n\nThe case \u2013 first filed in 2018 \u2013 seeks damages from the companies to pay for the costs of natural disasters like floods and wildfires, which have grown more severe and frequent due to global warming.\n\nToday\u2019s oral argument focused on a narrow question with big implications: whether Boulder\u2019s district court incorrectly allowed the county\u2019s lawsuit to proceed under state law.\n\nFor years, Exxon Mobil and Suncor have tried to move the proceedings to federal court or dismiss it outright, according to court documents and today\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cWe think Congress would have to authorize the state to permit this,\u201d said Kannon Shanmugam, an attorney for Exxon Mobil.\n\nSo far, that strategy has proved unsuccessful. In 2023, after several hearings in federal court, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the case. In June, the Boulder District Court denied further motions to dismiss the case. If the state supreme court upholds that ruling, it would clear the way for the beginning stages of a trial pending any further legal challenges.\n\n\u201cBoulder is increasingly burdened by the impacts of an altered climate, and our community cannot keep bearing the costs alone while those responsible avoid paying their fair share,\u201d said City of Boulder City Manager Nuria Rivera-Vandermyde in a June statement.\n\nColorado has experienced an increase in billion-dollar weather disasters since 1980. Researchers say climate change has at least worsened some of those disasters. In 2021, the Marshall Fire ripped through Boulder County, destroying over 1,000 homes and causing more than $2 billion in property damage.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Boulder County and the City of Boulder argues the fossil fuel companies spent decades misleading Colorado consumers about the potential risks of consuming their products. It uses a similar legal strategy as cases filed against the tobacco industry, which forced companies to help people dealing with health problems caused by smoking cigarettes.\n\nClimate change, however, is a far broader problem fueled by tailpipes and smokestacks worldwide. Due to that reality, the Colorado Supreme Court is currently considering whether climate-warming pollution is inherently an issue of federal concern and should not be addressed by state courts.\n\nOn Tuesday, Shanmugam, the attorney representing Exxon Mobil, argued allowing the case to proceed risked usurping the federal government's authority to regulate pollution that crosses state lines. If every local government filed a similar suit, he asserted, it would effectively displace the federal government\u2019s ability to regulate air quality and conduct international affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, Marco Simon, an attorney for the local governments, argued it doesn\u2019t matter if the emissions occurred outside of Colorado. Since the damages are taking place within the state\u2019s boundaries, Colorado residents deserve financial compensation.\n\n\u201cNo constitutional text or federal statute would allow a Texas or Delaware corporation the unlimited right to cause injury to communities within the state of Colorado without paying for their share of the damage caused. Exxon is here asking you to create an immunity Congress has not provided,\u201d Simon said.\n\nThe case is similar to dozens filed by municipalities nationwide seeking some compensation from fossil fuel corporations to pay for the effects of climate change. Many of those cases remain mired in legal hold ups. Others are slowly working their way through the courts.\n\nBoulder\u2019s case may have gotten a boost recently from developments in a similar case in Hawaii. In 2023, the Hawaii Supreme Court allowed a Honolulu lawsuit against oil giants including Sunoco and Shell to go to trial. The suit alleges that those companies deliberately concealed how burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear challenges to that case, paving the way for it to remain in state court.\n\nThat outcome is a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d according to Marco Simons, an attorney representing Boulder County, the City of Boulder and San Miguel County in their suits against the energy companies.\n\nBut other cases have not survived legal challenges. In January, a New York state supreme court justice dismissed a case filed by New York City against fossil fuel companies, which alleged they misled the public about climate change.\n\nA decision in the Boulder case is expected in several months.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best manufacturing stocks to buy now.\n\nThe manufacturing sector stands as a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, significantly contributing to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and technological innovation. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector contributed approximately $2.3 trillion to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 10.2% of the total U.S. GDP. Additionally, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that as of January 2025, the manufacturing sector employs approximately 12.76 million individuals.\n\nReshoring and Strategic Shifts:\n\nIn recent years, the sector has experienced notable trends that are reshaping its landscape. One prominent development is the movement towards reshoring\u2014the practice of bringing manufacturing operations back to the United States. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, ongoing trade frictions with China, and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reconsider the risks of offshoring. The decline in China\u2019s factory activity and the country\u2019s economic slowdown have also contributed to this shift, as firms seek to reduce their dependency on a single manufacturing hub. In fact, according to a report by CNBC, mentions of \u201creshoring\u201d in the broader market\u2019s earnings transcripts surged by 128% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, outpacing even the rise in discussions about artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Trends:\n\nManufacturing stocks have shown resilience over the past year. Despite challenges like inflation and shifting interest rates, the sector has benefited from strong domestic demand and strategic investments in technology. In 2024, greater asset price dispersion across securities, sectors, and countries created strong alpha opportunities for hedge funds. This market dynamic coincided with a significant increase in corporate profits within the U.S. manufacturing sector, which experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11.1%, as reported by NIST.\n\nOutlook and Future Growth Prospects:\n\nThe outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector is cautiously optimistic. Despite ongoing challenges, a focus on innovation and supportive policies position the sector for steady growth. According to a report by Reuters, in January 2025, manufacturing expanded for the first time since 2022, with the ISM manufacturing PMI rising to 50.9\u2014the highest reading since September 2022. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best manufacturing stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting manufacturing companies across various sub-sectors within the industry, including industrial equipment, automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. From this pool of companies, we identified the 10 best manufacturing stocks and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\n\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partner across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\n\n\n\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the U.S.-China tech war remain major concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+11.2% vs. +6.6%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience.\n\n\n\nWith a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\n\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\n\n\nServiceNow shares have outperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the past year (+30.1% vs. +9.5%). The company has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation.\n\n\n\nServiceNow had 2,109 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) at the end of the fourth quarter, which represents 14% year-over-year growth in customers. ServiceNow had 19 deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV. It closed 170 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) deals continued to gain traction.\n\n\n\nServiceNow is extensively leveraging AI and machine learning technologies to boost the potency of its solutions. Pro Plus AI grew 150% sequentially. It is riding on an expanding partner base and acquisitions. However, NOW is suffering from stiff competition and unfavorable forex.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on ServiceNow here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Willis Lease Finance have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry over the past year (+304% vs. -7.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.32 billion have given excellent returns as global commercial aircraft leasing market is fueled by rising air travel demand and a shift toward leasing over ownership. WLFC is well-positioned to benefit, with 81% of its $2.8 billion portfolio focused on narrowbody engines, critical for short-to-medium haul routes.\n\n\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, WLFC achieved record pre-tax earnings of $122.3 million. A new $1 billion credit facility boosts liquidity for growth, while sustainability initiatives position WLFC as a leader in aviation decarbonization. Vertical integration enhances profitability, with maintenance reserve revenues up 41% and spare parts sales surging 223% year over year.\n\n\n\nHowever, headwinds include rising debt costs, supply chain disruptions, high MRO expenses, and reliance on short-term leases, which expose WLFC to cyclicality.

Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other natural gas and oil dividend stocks.\n\nThe United States of America is the Largest Oil Producing Country in the World. The country\u2019s oil production has surged by almost 50% over the last decade, reaching just over 13.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in October 2024. However, despite the historically high levels of output, total US production growth has slowed in recent years, climbing only about 280,000 bpd last year. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecasted the country\u2019s crude oil production to flatten in 2026, with operators reducing the number of active drilling rigs as crude oil prices fall, allowing natural declines in existing wells to overtake production from new wells next year. The EIA expects US crude production to reach an all-time high in 2025, averaging 13.5 million bpd, increasing slightly to 13.6 million bpd in 2026.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nThe US natural gas output also stands near an all-time high as a period of strong demand and improved prices sparked a resurgence in production. The EIA expects these prices to further increase in 2025 and 2026 as demand for natural gas is projected to grow mainly due to a jump in LNG exports. The country\u2019s natural gas sector is also set to benefit greatly from the ongoing AI boom, as several dozen new gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in the US in the next few years. According to energy data provider Enverus, a total of 80 new gas power plants could be constructed in America by 2030, adding about 46 GW of new capacity \u2013 20% higher than the gas capacity additions in the last five years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made repeated calls to the American oil and gas sector to increase production as he holds the fossil fuel industry as a centerpiece of his broader economic mission. However, the country\u2019s O&G majors are reluctant as increasing output even further could create a glut and drive prices down, which they want to avoid.\n\nInstead, producers are focused on keeping their capital spending under control and attaining higher operational efficiencies, while prioritizing returning cash to shareholders after a pricing rout in the last decade hurt profits and share prices. Several oil bigwigs have even had to resort to borrowing money to make sure they keep their shareholders happy. According to a report by Janus Henderson, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago. However, maintaining such high payouts to shareholders will get even tougher for the oil majors in the future, as the EIA expects Brent crude oil prices to fall 8% to average $74 a barrel in 2025, then fall further to $66 a barrel in 2026.",

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Exxon Mobil.\n\nView our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nNYSE:XOM Ownership Breakdown February 10th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Exxon Mobil?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Exxon Mobil. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Exxon Mobil's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNYSE:XOM Earnings and Revenue Growth February 10th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Exxon Mobil is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.0% and 5.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.",

            "content": "BNEF\u2019s report also highlighted a clear divide between investment in well-established and emerging clean energy sectors. Proven technologies with scalable business models\u2014such as renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles, and power grids\u2014accounted for the bulk of 2024\u2019s investment, totaling $1.93 trillion, a 14.7% increase. This growth persisted despite challenges from policy changes, higher interest rates, and an expected slowdown in consumer demand.\n\nAlthough energy stocks fell short of investor expectations, global investment in the low-carbon energy transition grew by 11% in 2024, reaching a record $2.1 trillion, according to BloombergNEF\u2019s (BNEF) Energy Transition Investment Trends 2025 report. This growth was largely driven by increased investment in electrified transportation, renewable energy, power grids, and energy storage, all of which hit new highs last year. However, while total investment in energy transition technologies set a new record, its growth rate was slower than in the previous three years, when annual increases ranged from 24% to 29%.\n\n\u201cAs 2024 came to a close, markets responded to the environment for energy prices. In part, it reflects concern that Oil Petroleum Exporting Countries+ (OPEC+) may soon boost production, which would add to an already solid supply situation. The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn\u2019t well demanded. Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Europe are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global oil demand is lagging.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of 2024, energy sector stocks saw considerable fluctuations, rising by over 6% in November before declining nearly 10% in December. By the close of the year, the broader market\u2019s energy sector, which had been up nearly 20% at its highest point, finished 2024 with a return of just 5.72%. This performance fell well behind the wider market. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management, made the following comment about the performance of energy stocks:\n\nThe energy sector\u2019s presence within the broader US stock market has fluctuated over time. In the 1970s, it accounted for around 15% of the market, whereas today, it represents just 3.2% of the broader index, as reported by U.S. Bancorp Investments. However, energy consumption has increased since the 1970s, and its significance has not diminished. According to analysts, from an economic standpoint, energy stocks hold a more substantial role in the broader market than their current index weighting suggests.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best energy dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven as oil prices decline, an increasing number of fossil fuel companies are allocating a larger share of their profits to shareholders, indicating a shift in focus away from reinvesting in oilfield development. Some major oil firms have even taken on debt to maintain shareholder payouts. According to Bloomberg, four of the world\u2019s five oil supermajors borrowed a combined $15 billion between July and September 2024 to fund share buybacks, underscoring their commitment to rewarding investors. In addition, companies in the energy sector distributed over $49 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024, up from $32.2 billion three years ago, as reported by Janus Henderson.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of the third quarter of 2024.

The pandemic is certainly something that we will talk about for a long time, and sadly it isn\u2019t over yet, especially given these mutations.

Under Exxon Mobil's Coastal Plain Project, the company is proposing to construct a plant in the Calhoun County city of Point Comfort, about 110 miles southwest of Houston and across Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nExxon Mobil Corp is headquartered in Houston. jetcityimage/Getty Images\n\nThe plant is a steam cracking plant, which means hydrocarbons in natural gas will be cracked down into the ingredients used to make plastics at the facility. Exxon Mobil expects to generate 300 permanent and 300 contract jobs at the plant, and it is estimating more than $61 billion in operating revenues over the first 40 years of the plant's life. The company said that it's also considering other locations for this plant, including \"several countries/locations in the Middle East and Asia as well as other locations in North America.\"\n\nDetails are sparse on the project.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently pointed out some unexpected trends in the stock market this year, spotlighting a group of companies that have largely flown under the radar. These stocks, often overshadowed by the heavily discussed \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d, the dominant tech giants, are making significant gains without the fanfare. Cramer called them \u201cquiet winners,\u201d emphasizing that many of these stocks, particularly those outside the tech sector, are not getting the recognition they deserve from Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nCramer elaborated further on this point, noting that the leading stocks in 2025 have emerged from an unexpected mix of sectors, making this trend all the more interesting. Cramer remarked that it is clear that there is a shift happening in the market, with industries beyond tech making significant strides, yet remaining largely underappreciated by the broader investing community.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the insurance industry has experienced a particularly strong few years, noting its impressive pricing power, which has translated into higher premiums. This, in turn, has allowed insurance companies to invest those premiums in the bond market, generating significant returns.\n\nAdditionally, Cramer argued that the market often gets the most obvious things wrong, which ends up costing investors dearly. In his usual candid style, Cramer emphasized that while no investment is entirely foolproof, certain stocks show more resilience than others. \u201cThe key is to buy them when they\u2019re down because they won\u2019t stay down for long,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe continued, acknowledging that some stocks have stumbled recently, but he believes that many of the non-tech winners from this year still have room to grow. His message to investors was clear: focus on these quieter, non-tech stocks, as they have the potential to deliver strong returns even as the tech sector struggles with occasional setbacks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 6. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nA caller asked if Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was still the greatest of all time but Cramer recommended being in Chevron instead.\n\n\u201cYou know, look, frankly, I\u2019d rather see you in Chevron if you could do that\u2026 but I, no, we wanna stay away from Exxon\u2026 It\u2019s just, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not where the action is.\u201d\n\nExxon (NYSE:XOM) engages in the exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas. In September 2024, Cramer expressed disappointment with the stock as he said:\n\n\u201cDevon is actually cheaper than Exxon Mobil Corporation. Exxon is expensive, with only a 3.4% yield. It\u2019s not much better than Chevron, which yields 4.7%. It\u2019s not a good time to own oil. Demand was never there, and prices are finally falling.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that over the past year, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has risen over 7% while Chevron stock has gained less than 1%.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

For example, India\u2019s fertilizer factories accounted for nearly 31% of its total gas consumption in the last fiscal year. As India commits to self-sufficiency in fertilizer production, this sector will in a large part power the country\u2019s industrial demand for gas.\n\nIn transport, compressed natural gas (CNG) is increasingly becoming the fuel of choice for India\u2019s growing middle class.

            "content": "High Oil Prices: The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has surged above $70 per barrel, creating an advantageous climate for exploration and production activities. Similarly, Brent crude is performing well, trading at more than $75 per barrel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects the average spot prices for WTI and Brent in 2025 at $70.31 and $74.31 per barrel, respectively. This indicates a favorable upstream business environment for integrated oil companies.\n\nMidstream operations of energy companies entail transporting oil, natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products. In downstream businesses, the firms buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products. The companies\u2019 downstream activities involve chemical businesses that manufacture raw materials for plastics. The integrated players are gradually focusing on renewables, leading to the energy transition. The firms aim to lower emissions from operations and cut the carbon intensity of the products sold.\n\nThe Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry covers companies primarily involved in upstream, midstream and downstream operations. These companies have upstream businesses in the United States (including prolific shale plays and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico), Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and Europe.\n\nAmong the frontrunners in the industry that will likely make the most of the handsome business scenario are Exxon Mobil Corp. , Chevron Corp. , BP plc and Vista Energy SAB de CV .\n\nThis financial strength reinforces the promising outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry, ensuring stability even in volatile times. Additionally, these companies are actively participating in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, effectively balancing environmental considerations within the conventional energy sector.\n\nAmid the fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy market, oil prices continue to soar, creating a highly favorable landscape for upstream businesses. Integrated energy giants stand resilient, leveraging their robust midstream operations that deliver steady, fee-based revenues from strategically positioned pipeline and storage assets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStable Fee-Based Revenues: The midstream operations of integrated companies are less susceptible to commodity price volatility. This stability arises from the fact that pipeline and storage assets are typically contracted by shippers on a long-term basis, ensuring consistent fee-based revenue streams.\n\nStrong Focus on Lowering Emissions: Integrated industry players operating both within the United States and internationally have acknowledged climate change as a significant risk that must be addressed. These companies are not only concentrating on lowering greenhouse gas emissions and reducing flaring rates but also actively participating in multiple carbon CCS projects worldwide.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry is part of the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #85, which places it in the top 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 5.7% over this period, trailing the S&P 500\u2019s rally of 24.2% and the broader sector\u2019s improvement of 12.7%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt.\n\nOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 4.00X, lower than the S&P 500\u2019s 18.93X. It is also lower than the sector\u2019s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 4.42X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.55X and as low as 2.75X, with a median of 4.09X.\n\n4 Integrated International Stocks Moving Ahead of the Pack\n\nBP: The British energy giant plans to become a net-zero emissions player by 2050 or earlier. The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has solid upstream and downstream activities. BP also has a strong focus on reducing its debt load and has been returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\n\nChevron: It is also a leading integrated energy player with operations across the world. Apart from a strong balance sheet, it has a solid capital discipline that will help it tide over volatile commodity prices. The energy major\u2019s conservative capital spending will probably help CVX generate considerable cash flow, even in an unstable business scenario. The primary growth driver for the #3 Ranked stock, at least in the near to medium term, is its low-cost Permian projects. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nExxonMobil: It is among the largest integrated energy companies in the world. The energy major can rely on its strong balance sheet to withstand any business turmoil. ExxonMobil, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is banking on low-cost project pipelines centered around the Permian \u2014 the most prolific basin in the United States \u2014 and offshore Guyana resources. XOM has a steadfast commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is actively participating in multiple CCS projects worldwide.\n\nVista Energy, a leading exploration and production company, has a significant presence in Vaca Muerta, a highly productive shale oil and gas play outside of North America. The company, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has set an ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2026.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Exxon Mobil Corporation ( ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Exxon Mobil's shares before the 12th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 10th of March.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$0.99 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.96 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Exxon Mobil has a trailing yield of approximately 3.7% on its current stock price of US$108.43. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Exxon Mobil paid out a comfortable 49% of its profit last year. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 54% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.\n\nIt's positive to see that Exxon Mobil's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Exxon Mobil's earnings per share have risen 18% per annum over the last five years. Exxon Mobil is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Exxon Mobil has increased its dividend at approximately 3.7% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Exxon Mobil is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIs Exxon Mobil worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Exxon Mobil paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Exxon Mobil looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.\n\nWondering what the future holds for Exxon Mobil?

            "content": "Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has had a rough three months with its share price down 9.3%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on Exxon Mobil's ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exxon Mobil is:\n\n13% = US$35b \u00f7 US$271b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nExxon Mobil's Earnings Growth And 13% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Exxon Mobil seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 36% seen over the past five years by Exxon Mobil. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nNext, on comparing Exxon Mobil's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 40% over the last few years.\n\nNYSE:XOM Past Earnings Growth February 6th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is XOM worth today?

            "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nFor Sharon Sprayberry, the columns of pipes and rising smoke of ExxonMobil\u2019s refinery in Baytown have cast a shadow over her life. When she was a kid, a job at the refinery was how her father put food on the table. She believes it\u2019s also the reason that she developed asthma at a young age. Decades later, when she moved back to Baytown, she became part of a lawsuit against ExxonMobil under the Clean Air Act and after a 15-year wait, in December 2024, she got the news that her side won.\n\n\u201cIt was a great Christmas present,\u201d said Sprayberry, now 75, in an interview with the Houston Landing.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in December a lower court ruling that ExxonMobil committed more than 16,000 violations of its air permits at the refinery, incurring at least one violation each day for more than 8 years from 2005 to 2013. These occurred when the company expelled chemicals \u2014 including known carcinogens such as benzene and volatile organic compounds \u2014 into the air at levels above the legal limit allowed by the facility\u2019s air pollution permits.\n\nThese unauthorized emissions totaled nearly ten million pounds of pollutants, with 90 percent being substances that the Environmental Protection Agency determined could endanger public health, court documents show.\n\nAfter multiple appeals, the full panel of 17 judges at the Fifth Circuit upheld a previous ruling to fine ExxonMobil $14.25 million for its violations. The case is the largest citizen-initiated lawsuit to enforce the Clean Air Act, and the decision has given hope to the plaintiffs and Baytown residents living near the refinery. ExxonMobil made $33.7 billion in earnings in 2024. If it chooses to continue the legal fight, the company has until mid-March to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in this decision and we\u2019re considering other legal options,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokesperson said, in an email to the Landing.\n\nThe Environment Texas Citizen Lobby ruling vs. ExxonMobil ruling demonstrates that although it may take decades, residents can challenge industry when pollution impacts their lives. Yet, it also underscores the challenges in the relationship between the Houston area\u2019s petrochemical giants and neighboring communities. Refineries and chemical plants across the shipping channel provide vital fuel to the local economy, but they often leave residents uneasy about the noise, abrasive smells and occasional explosions.\n\n\u2018This air is not clean\u2019\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown complex stretches 3,400 acres along the shipping channel about 25 miles east of Downtown Houston, where the company directly employs about 2,000 people. In addition to the refinery that can process 584,000 barrels of crude oil per day, the complex also houses chemical manufacturing and advanced recycling plants.\n\nSprayberry is not looking to get any money from the lawsuit personally. The $14.25 million penalty will go to the EPA. Instead, her motivations revolve around the precedent the case could set. \u201cThe importance of the case is the legal standing for citizens to speak up and say, this air is not clean this, and this is why, and this is what needs to be done to rectify that,\u201c she said.\n\nBehind Sprayberry\u2019s motivations are her own health challenges that she links to living in Baytown.\n\n\u201cI had lived in the area, moved away, and then come back, and I could see the changes in my health,\u201d Sprayberry said.\n\nAt only three months old, Sprayberry was diagnosed with asthma. Her breathing problems did not go away until age 18 when she moved from near the refinery in Baytown to Waco, where she attended Baylor University. She chose that location in part because she knew from visiting her great-grandparents in Waco that it was easier to breathe the air there.\n\n\u201cThe day I moved into my dorm, I breathed wonderful, and I never used any asthma medication for the whole four years I was there,\u201d she said.\n\nShe went on to have a career in the Navy and then as a technology officer for public school districts, which eventually brought her back to Baytown in 2004. Breathing in what she described as a \u201csulfur-like chemical smell,\u201d her asthma flared up again after more than 35 years without any problems.\n\n(Top left) An air monitor outside of Mike Szumski\u2019s home on Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Baytown.

(Mark Felix for Houston Landing)\n\nAround the same time Sprayberry was moving back to Baytown, Environment Texas, a nonprofit that advocates for clean air, water, parks and taking action on climate change, was examining self-reported emissions data from ExxonMobil and other petrochemical companies in the area. They found numerous unintended emissions events exceeding legal pollution limits, which can be caused by equipment malfunctions, pressure build-ups and natural disasters. But the state regulatory agency, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, would not take action against the company, Luke Metzger, Executive Director for Environment Texas said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe decided that we needed to hold the polluters accountable ourselves,\u201d Metzger said.\n\nTCEQ fined ExxonMobil over $1.3 million for 36 air violations discovered at the Baytown refinery from 2005 to 2013. In an email to the landing, TCEQ described their enforcement process but did not respond to specific questions about the case.\n\nEnvironment Texas, along with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the group\u2019s members living in Baytown, including Sprayberry, using a section of the Clean Air Act that allows citizens to take legal action when they believe regulatory agencies are failing to enforce the law.\n\nEnvironment Texas filed similar suits against Shell and Chevron Phillips for air permit violations at their facilities in the Houston area. Both of those companies agreed to settle the cases in 2009 and 2010, pay a combined $7.8 million and install better pollution controls, which resulted in a 95% reduction in major unplanned emissions, Metzger said.\n\nLingering questions about emissions\n\nThroughout the eight-year period covered by the lawsuit, court documents show that ExxonMobil did make investments to improve pollution controls in Baytown. The company spent more than $6 billion on facility maintenance and measures to better comply with environmental regulations. And by 2013 the amount of unauthorized emissions had decreased 95% from 2006 levels, according to a dissenting opinion signed by eight judges at the Fifth Circuit.\n\nLawyers for Environment Texas are skeptical of these amounts but they acknowledge that ExxonMobil did make significant investments that lowered emissions. However, Metzger said that many investments occurred after the lawsuit was filed and overall air pollution reductions were only temporary.\n\nSeveral key pollutants at the refinery have increased since 2013, according to EPA data. In 2021, the most recent year with facility-level data available, the amount of benzene emitted at the refinery was up 60 percent compared to 2013. Emissions of the compound 1,3-Butadiene, which along with benzene is listed as a carcinogen by the National Institute of Health, went up 78 percent over the same period.\n\nEmissions of toluene, which can cause eye irritation, trouble breathing, dizziness, and nausea, increased by a staggering 449 percent in the same period.\n\nAs the company looks to appeal the latest ruling, it also continues to expand its Baytown complex, and some residents and environmental groups believe ExxonMobil is still not doing enough to prevent excessive pollution.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have not seen a dramatic improvement in ExxonMobil being a good neighbor in regards to air emissions,\u201d said Executive Director of Air Alliance Houston Jennifer Hadayia. \u201cVery little has changed.\u201d\n\n(Left) Theresa Blackwood poses for a portrait at her home,Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Baytown. (Right) The Exxon plant as seen from Mike Szumski\u2019s home, Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Baytown. (Mark Felix for Houston Landing)\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown complex was named by Air Alliance Houston near the top of its \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d in a 2024 report that compared the largest sources of air pollution in the Houston area using the most recent five years of data from the EPA and TCEQ.\n\n\u201cBeing a good neighbor is our priority. We remain focused on reducing emissions from our Baytown site and improving air quality in the community while providing the products that society relies on,\u201d said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil in a statement to the Landing. \u201cWe strive to comply with all applicable regulations across our operations.\u201d\n\nBaytown resident Theresa Blackwood\u2019s concern over air pollution has led her to keep a log of incidents \u2014 whether its strong smells, vibrations or loud noises \u2014 that she notices from her home, less than a mile from the edge of ExxonMobil\u2019s property.\n\nIf she goes outside at the wrong time, bad smells affect multiple parts of her body; \u201cYour eyes will burn. Your throat can burn,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s not announced, so when you walk out, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re walking out to.\u201d\n\nBirds sit on wooden piers overlooking Scott Bay in the back of Terri Blackwood\u2019s home on Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Baytown. (Mark Felix for Houston Landing)\n\nBlackwood, 58, had moved 27 times in her life before settling in Baytown, and she said she loves her home on the shipping channel. \u201cI watch ships all day long,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it looks like Christmas lights. Oh my god, it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\nHowever, when foul odors overtake her home, Blackwood worries about long-term health effects because she doesn\u2019t know what she is breathing in. Although she was not involved in the lawsuit, the court decision is exciting and gives her a sense of hope that standing up to ExxonMobil could be worth it.\n\n\u201cExxon knows that the public is watching,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be more transparent.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that from 2005 to 2013, TCEQ issued 36 violations and $1,358,745 in penalties against ExxonMobil\u2019s Baytown refinery.\n\nRelated\n\nRepublish This Story Republish our articles for free, online or in print.",

            "content": "However, equity markets rebounded strongly as global earnings soared, primarily driven by Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Since dividends are typically determined by conservative boards and management, they tend to lag behind earnings during significant earnings surges. As a result, dividend payout ratios are now near their lowest levels in 25 years, meaning companies are paying out less compared to historical averages. Simply returning to a more typical payout level could contribute an additional 2% annual growth over the next five years. This isn\u2019t just a theoretical scenario\u2014global dividend growth has already started to exceed earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters, as reported by J.P. Morgan.\n\nBecause of this earnings and income potential, income investors often turn to dividend stocks when the market shifts. While these stocks may not be keeping pace with the broader market, analysts remain optimistic about their future prospects. A report from J.P. Morgan indicated that global equities are approaching a notable period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a long-term increase in dividend momentum. Over the past 20 years, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts predict this growth will accelerate to 7.6%. The main factor driving this increased growth is the low starting point of payout ratios (dividends as a proportion of earnings). During the Covid pandemic in 2020, many companies cut their dividends, leading to a 12% drop in global dividends, which was a steeper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This was a rational response to an uncertain environment with unpredictable effects and duration.\n\nIn recent years, many investors have shifted their focus from dividend-paying stocks to high-growth secular-themed stocks that typically don\u2019t offer dividends. However, history shows that investors shouldn\u2019t overlook dividends. According to estimates by AGF Investments, the long-term case for dividend-paying equities is strong: if a dollar was invested in the broader market Index in 1927 without reinvesting dividends, it would be worth $243 today. In contrast, that same dollar with dividends reinvested would be worth $3,737.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy and hold.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile recent market gains have largely been driven by a small group of non-dividend-paying companies, this is starting to shift. In 2024, many big tech companies initiated their dividend policies, highlighting the importance of returning capital to shareholders and positioning dividends as a complement to share buybacks. The report highlighted that although the dividend yields from these tech giants are initially modest, the total amount they are committing to dividends is significant\u2014$17 billion collectively over the next year. More importantly, these actions send a strong signal to the market.\n\nIncome-focused investors have increasingly turned their attention to dividend income, making it a more prominent part of personal earnings. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that dividend income has risen from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, demonstrating its growing importance as an income source. The report further highlighted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for over a third of total equity returns, with the rest coming from capital gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned through various credible sources, including Business Insider, Forbes, Morningstar, and Barron\u2019s, and identified their consensus picks from their recent articles. Next, we sorted these companies based on the number of hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database that owned stakes in these companies, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) the Best Dividend Stock To Buy and Hold?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American oil and gas company that is engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of petroleum products. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $83.4 billion, which fell by 1.1% from the same period last year. Since 2019, the company has achieved a cumulative $12.1 billion in Structural Cost Savings, surpassing the accomplishments of its competitors and more than compensating for inflation and growth. Its return on capital employed was the industry leader for the year, reaching 12.7%, and its five-year average stood at 10.8%.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\u2019s cash position also came in strong in FY24. The company generated $55 billion in free cash flow, marking its third-best year in the past decade. Its free cash flow for the year amounted to $36.2 billion. During the year, the company returned $16.7 billion to shareholders through dividends. It also intends to extend its annual $20 billion share repurchase program until 2026.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) remains a leading player in the global fossil fuel industry while also increasing its investments in low-carbon energy. As part of its 2030 strategy, it plans to allocate up to $30 billion towards low-emission projects from 2025 to 2030. Additionally, the company has secured the largest offshore carbon dioxide storage site in the US through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. It is also making progress on developing the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility, with an expected capacity of up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day.\n\nOn January 31, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been growing its payouts for 42 consecutive years, which makes XOM one of the best dividend stocks on our list.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 indicated that 86 hedge funds owned stakes in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared with 92 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $7 billion. First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company\u2019s leading stakeholders.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 2nd on our list of best dividend stocks to buy and hold. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, triggering volatility in the commodity and energy markets. The move includes a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican exports and a 10% levy on Chinese imports, aimed at addressing illegal immigration and drug trade concerns. In response, the affected nations have vowed to retaliate, while China has signaled plans to challenge the measures at the World Trade Organization.\n\nImpact on Oil and Gas Markets\n\nGoldman Sachs predicted that Canadian oil producers will bear most of the cost, leading to a $3-$4 per barrel widening of the Canadian crude discount due to limited alternative export routes. U.S. refiners and consumers will also see increased costs, adding another $2-$3 per barrel burden. Meanwhile, Barclays noted that refineries in the U.S. Midwest, which process Canadian crude, will share the incremental costs with producers and end consumers.\n\nUnlike crude oil, the impact on natural gas exports is expected to be more muted. Goldman Sachs forecasted a modest decline of 0.16 billion cubic feet per day in Canadian natural gas exports to the United States due to the 10% tariffs.\n\nUnderstanding the Tariffs and Their Implications\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs, primarily targeting steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods, could significantly affect the energy market, both directly and indirectly. One major concern is the impact on U.S. refiners, many of who depend on imported crude oil, particularly heavier grades from Canada and Mexico. If tariffs result in retaliatory trade barriers or higher import costs, refining margins could come under pressure, making operations less profitable.\n\nAdditionally, the energy sector is a major consumer of steel and aluminum, materials essential for constructing pipelines, drilling rigs and refining units. Higher costs for these raw materials due to tariffs could slow down infrastructure projects and reduce overall profitability, potentially delaying critical developments in the industry.\n\nHowever, there could also be potential benefits for U.S. oil producers. Tariffs on foreign oil imports may make domestically produced crude more attractive, causing refiners to seek alternatives within the country. This shift could particularly benefit shale producers, whose low-cost operations might see increased demand as refiners adjust to the changing trade landscape.\n\nU.S. Energy Stocks Likely to Benefit\n\nDespite the near-term volatility, we have identified three U.S. energy companies that stand to gain significantly in the evolving tariff landscape. These are EOG Resources (EOG), Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). While EOG Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, Cheniere Energy and ExxonMobil have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

The event is a joint initiative between ExxonMobil and Junior Achievement Europe (JA Europe), a leader in entrepreneurship and work preparation programs for young people. An annual competition, it encourages 15- to 18-year-olds to study STEM: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nIn November, ExxonMobil and JA Europe celebrated this milestone in Brussels. The STEM4Entrepreneurship Forum brought together students, companies and policymakers. Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, spoke at the event \u2013 highlighting the importance of STEM education. The commissioner explained that Europe needs STEM skills \u201cto preserve European innovation and competitiveness when navigating the green and digital transitions.\u201d He added that \u201cinvesting in STEM skills is a fundamental investment in our future.\u201d\n\nAntonella Sopranzetti, director, government relations and advocacy at ExxonMobil, took part in a STEM education panel at the Forum.

The bottom line, however, declined from the year-ago level of $2.48.\n\nTotal quarterly revenues of $83.4 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $87.1 billion. The top line also decreased from the year-ago figure of $84.3 billion. For more details, read our blog: ExxonMobil's Q4 Earnings Top Estimates on Higher Production.\n\nChevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP are two other prominent integrated energy companies. While Chevron has already announced its earnings, BP has yet to release its report.\n\nPermian & Guyana: Twin Engines of ExxonMobil\u2019s Expansion\n\nWith a strong focus on strengthening its presence in the Permian, ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company on May 3, 2024. With 1.4 million net acres of the combined company in the Delaware and Midland basins, having an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource, ExxonMobil has greatly transformed its upstream portfolio.\n\nBased on 2024 volumes, the company expects its production from the most prolific basin to increase significantly to 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D) by 2030, thanks to the improved drilling & production techniques.\n\nSimilar to its operations in the Permian, ExxonMobil boasts a robust project pipeline in offshore Guyana resources. Notably, Guyana operations have achieved a production rate of 650,000 barrels per day within just 10 years of the initial oil discovery.\n\nThus, the integrated energy giant is well-positioned to generate significant returns from both the Permian and Guyana due to low production costs in these assets. With oil prices remaining favorable this year, ExxonMobil is poised to generate substantial cash flows from its upstream operations, which contribute the majority to its total earnings.\n\nXOM\u2019s Low-Carbon and Innovation Initiatives\n\nXOM is investing significantly in low-carbon initiatives, including a hydrogen facility with zero carbon emissions and extensive carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. These efforts reflect XOM\u2019s dedication to diversifying its portfolio and advancing energy solutions for a sustainable future.",

The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations despite challenges in the refining segment, showcasing its strong cash flows and shareholder returns. Exxon Mobil has announced substantial share buybacks and a dividend increase, reflecting confidence in its financial health.\n\nSarkar also highlights the company\u2019s growth potential with key projects set to begin in 2025, which are anticipated to contribute significantly to earnings by 2026. Additionally, Exxon Mobil\u2019s strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources strengthens its position in the Permian Basin, enhancing its production capabilities. The company\u2019s focus on emission-reduction goals and investments in low-carbon solutions further support its competitive stance in the energy industry. These factors contribute to the Buy rating with a target price of USD 133, suggesting resilience against market volatility.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $137.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "probability": null,
            "content": "ExxonMobil (XOM -0.42%) has built a premier oil company. The energy giant has an unrivaled asset base. It controls a treasure trove of low-cost oil and gas around the world. The company also has an integrated products solutions business in chemicals and refining that enables it to maximize nearly every molecule of hydrocarbons it produces.\n\nThe oil company's competitively advantaged asset base has enabled it to produce unrivaled earnings and returns compared to its peers in the oil patch. Here's a closer look at Exxon's dominance over its rivals, which could continue for many years to come.\n\nAn unmatched value proposition\n\nExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods showcased the strength of the company's portfolio and strategy when speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings conference call:\n\nWe are creating unmatched value for our shareholders. Compared to the IOCs (international oil companies) over the last five years, we've grown cash flow from operations at a roughly 15% compounded annual growth rate, more than double the closest competitor. We've distributed more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks, $30 billion more than the closest competitor. And we delivered a total shareholder return compounded annual growth of 14%, 600 basis points higher than the closest competitor.\n\nExxon isn't just delivering industry-leading results; it's absolutely crushing its peers in every crucial category. For example, last year, the company reported $34 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations. Both were its third highest tally in the past decade despite weaker market conditions. For comparison, Chevron's adjusted earnings were $18.3 billion, and its cash flow from operations was $31.5 billion, while Shell reported $23.7 billion in adjusted earnings and $54.7 billion in cash flow from operations. Exxon also distributed $36 billion in cash to its shareholders through dividends and repurchases. That was more than all but five companies in the S&P 500 and exceeded the cash returns of Chevron, at $27 billion, and Shell, at $22.6 billion.\n\nA big factor fueling its ability to produce industry-leading earnings and cash returns is its capacity to earn high returns when investing in developing its advantaged asset base. Woods noted on the call that Exxon delivered a return on capital employed (ROCE) of 13% last year and an industry-leading average of 11% over the past five years. Strip out its massive cash balance of $23.2 billion at the end of last year, along with projects under construction that haven't yet started up, and its ROCE rises to about 17% last year and an average of 15% over the past five years. The company's disciplined investment approach and high-quality asset base drive those robust returns.\n\nPlenty more in the tank\n\nExxon is in an excellent position to continue delivering industry-leading results in the future. Woods noted on the call:\n\nLooking ahead, the value creation arc of the company is equally distinguished. We're going to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio with 60% of our upstream production from advantaged assets by 2030. That's nearly the same amount as the next largest IOC's total production. We're going to develop an even more profitable product mix with 80% growth of high-value product sales and product solutions by 2030. We're going to be an even more efficient operator, taking an additional $6 billion in cost out of the business. We're going to generate even more earnings in cash on a constant price and margin basis.\n\nThe company aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by 2030. That would further widen its lead over its peers in the oil patch.\n\nExxon's strategy is highly achievable and already in motion. For example, it has several major growth projects on track to start up this year, including its fourth and largest development in Guyana, its Golden Pass LNG project in the U.S., and a major upgrade project at its Singapore refining and chemical complex. These projects should add more than $3 billion to Exxon's earnings by 2026. Exxon is also investing heavily in growing its production in the Permian Basin, which will get a boost from last year's acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company expects to capture more than $3 billion in synergies from that deal over the next decade while growing its combined output in the Permian by 50% by 2030.\n\nA well-oiled, value-creating machine\n\nExxonMobil is the unrivaled leader of the oil patch. It should continue to lead its peers in the future, fueled by its heavy investment in developing its best-in-class asset base. The company is in a strong position to deliver peer-leading total returns in the future, making it a top oil stock to buy and hold for the long haul.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to comment on the DeepSeek fallout. He shared that while the performance of the Chinese AI model was impressive, especially as it had managed to match models such as OpenAI's o1, there were other factors to consider particularly when gauging the demand for high-end Blackwell GPUs. These GPUs are made by Wall Street's favorite AI GPU firm, and Cramer is increasingly starting to tilt towards the fact that their true magic might lie in enabling the proper functioning of humanoid robots.\n\nAs for the stock, the CNBC TV host continued to assert that there is a large chunk of traders that do not properly understand the company. Cramer shared \"I was in a bar last week, person to the right said I bought [the GPU stock] because of you. A person left said I bought [the GPU stock] cause of you.\" He added that in response he asked does \"anyone know what [the GPU stock] does?\" Yet, instead of outlining the firm's business model, \"They said yeah! It's something that you recommend!\" he added.\n\nWhile the GPU company might have lost close to $600 billion in value during the selloff, another AI news caught Cramer's attention. This was a Reuters report that claimed that OpenAI was seeking to raise $40 billion in capital on a $400 billion valuation. When asked how such valuation was possible, particularly after Monday's havoc, Cramer replied \"So I was just being like you. It is, without a doubt, a time not of inflation, but of a recognition.\" He added that this 'recognition' is why he likes the GPU firm as well. So what is the recognition that's got Cramer enamored? Well, according to him \"it's a recognition that it is a new industrial revolution. And anybody who's in it is a worth lot more than the people that aren't!\"\n\nHe also sardonically targeted co-host David Faber and said \"Look I'm sure that when they discovered the cotton gin, and you're a weaver, you're saying you know what, that's ridiculous!\" Not satisfied, Cramer continued \"Remember the steam engine? Are you still liking the wheel and the pulley? Are you the wedge? You're the wedge!\"\n\nCramer also commented on the market moving higher during the day after the week's devastation. He mentioned a couple of non-tech sectors that had particularly done well. In his words:",

In response, Exxon has now sued Bonta and environmental groups, claiming the allegations defamed the oil conglomerate.\n\n\"Exxon Mobil has not engaged in a decades-long secret mission to brainwash or deceive the public,\" Exxon stated in its federal lawsuit, per reports by the Times.\n\nExxon is not only seeking retractions from Bonta and the environmental groups but also monetary damages.\n\nDespite Exxon's allegations, experts view the suit as yet another attempt by the company to ultimately divert attention away from its role in the climate crisis. The Times reported that a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice called the suit \"another attempt from Exxon Mobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception.\"\n\nWhy is Exxon's lawsuit important?\n\nExxon's lawsuit is another example of the oil giant refusing to take accountability for its deception and push for single-use plastics. As major corporations continue to falsely market plastic as recyclable, more single-use plastics end up in landfills and release harmful microplastics into the environment.\n\nWhat's being done about Exxon's lawsuit?\n\nExxon's lawsuit is not surprising as the company, like other dirty energy businesses, is dealing with the repercussions of misleading the public about the climate crisis.\n\nAccording to the Times, Mr. Bonta reported looking forward to \"vigorously litigating\" the case. His lawsuit against Exxon was filed after a lengthy investigation that Bonta claims could amount to damages worth \"multiple billions of dollars.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Revenue also disappointed, coming in at $83.43 billion compared to forecasts of $85.35 billion. Following the announcement, Exxon\u2019s stock price plummeted by 2.5% during regular trading hours, closing at $106.96. It later ticked up slightly by 0.12% during aftermarket trading but remained near its 52-week low of $100.42.\n\nCEO Darren Woods highlighted the challenges faced during this quarter, stating, \u201cWhen this team takes the field, we expect to win.\u201d He emphasized Exxon's goal of achieving significant growth through various business ventures by 2030, targeting $20 billion increases to earnings and $30 billion to cash flow. The company also remains focused on its carbon capture technologies, asserting leadership with its unique integrated system for managing carbon emissions.\n\nDespite the earnings miss, Woods reiterated Exxon's investment strategy and commitment to innovation, particularly around carbon capture, which he described as being central to the company\u2019s long-term plans. \u201cWe\u2019re the only company in the world today with an end-to-end system capable of capturing, transporting and storing carbon emissions,\u201d he noted, aiming to leverage this advantage over competitors.\n\nMeanwhile, Flushing Financial Corporation reported even bleaker results. The bank experienced substantial challenges, ending the fourth quarter with a GAAP loss per share of $1.61, well below the anticipated core earnings of $0.21. Revenue took a severe hit, reporting negative $19.78 million, starkly contrasting with the expected $51.02 million. This resulted from pre-tax losses estimated at $76 million triggered by significant balance sheet restructuring.\n\nFlushing\u2019s stock fell by 4.96% in after-hours trading, closing at $13.61, reflecting investor disappointment with the financial institution\u2019s performance. CEO John Buran, amid these setbacks, maintained optimism about future profitability, declaring, \u201cThe operating environment has turned more favorable and we continue to invest in the business to drive future profitability.\u201d He highlighted plans to optimize the balance sheet and emphasized the importance of lowering deposit rates.\n\nBuran noted operational improvements, with the company's net interest margin (NIM) having increased by 29 basis points on a GAAP basis. He expressed confidence for the upcoming quarters, discussing potential growth from loan expansions and stabilized asset levels. Flushing Financial anticipates increased non-interest expenses of 5-8% but is projecting gradual recovery moving forward.\n\nWhile both companies navigate earnings misses, their strategic adaptations to challenges reflect broader market dynamics. Investors will be closely monitoring how Exxon Mobil capitalizes on its strengths and navigates potential risks, including market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. Likewise, Flushing Financial will focus on its restructuring efforts, the competitive pressures it faces, and its growth strategy within the Asian market.\n\nThe outlook remains mixed for both companies as they seek to adapt and overcome current economic challenges. The road to recovery hinges on operational execution, smart investments, and how effectively they leverage their unique market positions going forward.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So do demand forecasts for the natural gas that will power those energy-hungry data centers.\n\nGas demand could increase by 10 Bcf/d by 2030 due to AI demand, a 28% increase over the 35 Bcf/d currently consumed for U.S. electricity generation, according to Wells Fargo.\n\nAppalachian gas giant EQT Corp. has told investors could result in as much as 18 Bcf/d in incremental demand by the end of the decade.\n\nEveryone along the energy value chain is excited about the chatter, from gas producers to gas transporters to the power plant operators themselves.\n\nOn Jan. 28, Chevron announced a new partnership to develop \u201cscalable, reliable power solutions\u201d for U.S.-based data centers running on natural gas. The partnership includes Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova.\n\nChevron has secured seven of GE Vernova\u2019s largest 7HA gas-fired turbines under a slot reservation agreement on an accelerated timeline.\n\nTurbine deliveries are expected to begin in late 2026, Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said during the company\u2019s Jan. 31 earnings call. In the meantime, Chevron continues to advance site selection and engineering work while engaging with technology customers.\n\nThe \u201cpower foundry\u201d projects will serve data centers in the U.S. Southeast, Midwest and West regions.\n\nWirth reminded analysts that Chevron already operates around 5 gigawatts (GW) of power generation for the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, the Tengiz Field Future Growth Project (FGP) in Kazakhstan and its various refinery assets.\n\n\u201cWe know how to build and operate large-scale power generation and integrate it to a core customer,\u201d Wirth said.\n\nChevron also has a \u201cvery large natural gas position\u201d in the U.S. to leverage for these projects, he said.\n\nLike its growing LNG business, Chevron sees supplying gas-fired power to data center customers as another profitable outlet for its bountiful gas reserves.\n\nRELATED\n\nEnergy Transfer\u2019s Lake Charles LNG Closer to FID with Chevron Deal\n\nChevron power\n\nChevron produced over 2.7 Bcf/d from its U.S. upstream assets in the fourth quarter; U.S. liquids output averaged nearly 1.2 MMbbl/d.\n\nChevron\u2019s power foundries will be constructed off the broader grid, or \u201cbehind the meter,\u201d and won\u2019t further strain the nation\u2019s already beleaguered power grid infrastructure, Wirth said.\n\nHe said the behind-the-meter projects also shouldn\u2019t raise electricity costs for the average ratepaying consumer, like ratepayers are seeing in other parts of the country.\n\nA PJM Interconnection capacity auction last summer hit record highs, driven by rapidly increasing power demand and coal plant retirements. PJM is the grid operator for all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington D.C.\n\nChevron has no intention of being a merchant power player and selling electricity to the grid, Wirth said. Instead, the company will serve as backstop power supply for \u201cpremium customers.\u201d\n\nThe initial partnership with Engine No. 1 aims to deliver up to 4 GW of generation by the end of 2027.\n\nRELATED\n\nBYOP (Bring Your Own Power): The Great AI Race for Electrons\n\nExxon\u2019s CCUS advantage\n\nExxon Mobil also has a massive U.S. natural gas footprint, including growing volumes from its Permian Basin assets.\n\nU.S. gas production averaged about 3.26 Bcf/d in the fourth quarter, up from 3.14 Bcf/d the quarter before, Exxon said Jan. 31. U.S. liquids output averaged 1.47 MMbbl/d, up from 1.44 MMbbl/d in the third quarter.\n\nExxon also has a fully-integrated carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) arm to reduce emissions associated with the gas-to-power process\u2014a key advantage for the company in the tech companies\u2019 jockeying race for cleaner electrons.\n\nExxon owns the nation\u2019s largest carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) transport and storage network, picked up through a $4.9 billion acquisition of CCUS and E&P company Denbury Inc. in 2023.\n\nDecarbonization through CCUS is \u201cthe nexus\u201d of Exxon\u2019s data-center power strategy, Woods said.\n\nLike Chevron, Exxon\u2019s not interested in getting into the power utility business. Utility returns for power generation would not compete for capital within the supermajor\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\u201cBut leveraging the end-to-end system that we have for capturing, transporting and storing CO 2 is a huge advantage and brings a lot of value for hyperscalers who are looking to have decarbonized power and manage their emissions,\u201d Woods said.\n\nConversations with tech customers continue. Sites for projects have been selected.\n\nExxon outlined some high-level plans in its corporate update in December: It would construct a natural gas-fired plant capable of generating more than 1.5 GW of power.\n\nThe CCUS buildout would remove over 90% of the associated CO 2 emissions and transport them for permanent sequestration underground.\n\nAnd the projects would sit behind the meter, independent of utility timelines and concerns from ratepayers.\n\nDepending on how negotiations proceed, Exxon could have a site powered up and running by 2028 and fully decarbonized by 2029, Woods said.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a rough order or how to think about that [timeline], but we\u2019re well into the development phase,\u201d he said.\n\nRELATED\n\nExxon\u2019s Custom, Lightweight Proppant Boosts Permian EURs by 15%",

The oil giant delivered an industry-leading financial performance last year, producing over $33 billion in earnings and $55 billion in cash flow from operations. That was its third-best performance over the past decade.\n\nWhat's remarkable about Exxon's success last year is that it achieved such strong results without a big boost from commodity prices. Instead, the company's business transformation strategy helped fuel its strong year.\n\nA strong year despite some headwinds\n\nExxon produced about $33.7 billion, or $7.84 per share, of earnings last year, around $2.3 billion less than in 2023. That was largely due to a $2 billion impairment related to regulatory challenges in restarting production and distribution from the now-sold Santa Ynez Unit in California. In addition, the company faced some headwinds from lower refining industry margins and a decline in natural gas prices from 2023's historically high levels.\n\nThe oil giant offset most of last year's headwinds thanks to record production from Guyana and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, record high-value product sales volumes, and its structural cost savings program. Since launching this program in 2019, Exxon has achieved $12.1 billion of cumulative structural cost savings, well beyond what any of its competitors have delivered. That includes $2.4 billion realized last year.\n\nExxon also continues to invest heavily in growing its best assets, like Guyana and the Permian. It closed its needle-moving acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, bulking up its position in the Permian. The company has also invested in growing the production of higher-value refining and chemical products.\n\nThis strategy enabled Exxon to produce a whopping $55 billion in cash flow from operations and $34.4 billion in free cash flow after continuing to invest heavily in developing its best assets. The oil giant returned an industry-leading $36 billion in cash to investors last year, more than all but five companies in the S&P 500. It paid $16.7 billion in dividends (including raising its payout for the 42nd year in a row) and repurchased $19.3 billion of shares. That was its highest share repurchase total in more than a decade.\n\nEven better days lie ahead\n\n\"As we look ahead,\" stated Exxon CEO Darren Woods in the fourth-quarter earnings press release, \"we've built a long runway of value creation.\" The energy giant plans to continue investing heavily in developing its asset base, implementing its cost-reduction initiatives, and returning more cash to shareholders.\n\nExxon had previously outlined its 2030 vision to generate an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in cash flow by 2030. The strategy has many layers. A significant aspect is deploying about $140 billion into major projects and its Permian Basin development program by 2030.\n\nThat investment will grow output from its highest-margin assets, which will increase its earnings and free cash flow. Exxon also plans to deliver a cumulative $18 billion in cost savings by the end of 2030. It's on track to achieve $3 billion of synergies over the next decade from its Pioneer acquisition.\n\nThe company's investment and cost savings strategy has put it on track to produce an even bigger gusher of excess free cash flow. Exxon estimates it could produce $165 billion in surplus cash through 2030. That should enable the company to continue increasing its dividend. Exxon also plans to continue buying back shares, targeting around $20 billion in annual purchases in 2025 and 2026, assuming reasonable market conditions.\n\nEven with its massive capital spending and cash returns, Exxon should maintain its fortress-like balance sheet. The company ended last year with a cash balance of $23.2 billion, giving it a net leverage ratio of just 6%, a very comfortable level for an oil company.\n\nAn elite oil stock\n\nExxon is the top player in the oil patch. The company's strategy of investing in its best assets and reducing costs is paying dividends for shareholders. It has the oil giant on track to deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next several years, which should allow it to continue returning a boatload of cash to investors. These catalysts could give Exxon the fuel to produce peer-leading returns in the coming years, making it a top oil stock to hold for the long haul.",

Cash flow from operating activities was $12.2 billion and free cash flow was $8.0 billion.\n\nCapital and exploration expenditures, and cash capital expenditures were both $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year expenditures to $27.6 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively \u2013 both in line with full-year guidance. For full-year 2024, the company reported earnings of $33.7 billion, or $7.84 per share assuming dilution.\n\n\u201cOur transformed company delivered unmatched value in 2024,\u201d said Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\u201cThe proof is in our performance. Operationally, we delivered strong results on safety, reliability, and emissions. Financially, we delivered some of our highest earnings and operating cash flow in a decade. We earned returns higher than our peers3 and well above our cost of capital, and we distributed more cash to shareholders than all but five companies in the entire S&P 500.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead, we\u2019ve built a long runway of value creation. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver on the plans we laid out to generate significantly more earnings and cash \u2013 not only to 2030, but well beyond.

Unfavorable 2023 identified items included a $2.0 billion impairment in California due to regulatory challenges restarting production and distribution from the now-divested Santa Ynez Unit assets.\n\nEarnings excluding identified items decreased as industry refining margins and natural gas prices declined from last year's historically high levels.\n\nStrong advantaged volume growth including record production from Guyana and Permian, and record high-value product sales volumes, more than offset lower base volumes from non-strategic asset divestments and scheduled maintenance.\n\nStructural cost savings partly offset higher expenses from depreciation, scheduled maintenance, new product development and 2025 project start-ups.\n\nSince 2019, the company achieved $12.1 billion of cumulative Structural Cost Savings, well beyond what any competitors have achieved, and more than offsetting inflation and growth. This includes $2.4 billion of savings during the year and $0.8 billion during the quarter. The company expects to deliver $18 billion of cumulative savings through the end of 2030 versus 2019.\n\nReturn on capital employed led industry for the year at 12.7% and for the five-year average at 10.8%2.\n\nThe debt-to-capital ratio was 13% and the net-debt-to-capital ratio was 6%4, reflecting a period-end cash balance of $23.2 billion.",

            "content": "PROFITS for Exxon Mobil and Chevron were slammed by slumping fuel margins as the prospect of US tariffs on two major oil suppliers threatens to make the refining business even worse.\n\nExxon posted a 67 per cent plunge in 2024 refining profits on Friday (Jan 31), and Chevron disclosed an even larger decline of 72 per cent. The biggest North American oil companies succumbed to the same forces slashing results for fuel producers around the world \u2013 a flood of new output amid stagnating demand.\n\nThose lacklustre performances in a key business line come as US President Donald Trump ramps up threats to lay steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both of which are crucial sources of crude for US-based refineries. Such levies \u2013 which Trump said may take effect as soon as the weekend \u2013 would increase the cost of making everything from gasoline and diesel to jet fuel.\n\nThe president vowed on Thursday to follow through on long-promised 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products, though he declined to say whether oil would be included in the list. His self-imposed effective date is Feb 1.\n\nRefineries in the US Midwest depend on Canadian oil for as much as three-fourths of their crude inputs. Meanwhile, Mexican supplies have long been a staple of Gulf Coast fuel-making plants designed to maximise output from so-called heavy crude. As the cost of buying oil from those two nations rises, it could create a knock-on effect for other types of crude as refiners clamour to secure replacement barrels with similar characteristics.\n\nChevron\u2019s domestic refineries tend to hug coastal areas, which means they have easier access to crude cargoes from overseas compared with inland competitors, said chief executive officer Mike Wirth.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\n\u201cWe tend to be more around the coasts so we\u2019ve got more flexibility because you can bring in product on ships as opposed to by pipeline from Canada,\u201d Wirth said during an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cLast year, less than 10 per cent of our feedstock came from either Mexico or Canada and so our company wouldn\u2019t probably feel it quite the way the others would. But it could create some impacts depending upon where your assets are.\u201d\n\nExxon\u2019s full-year refining earnings dropped to US$4 billion from US$12.1 billion in 2023, according to a statement on Friday. As for Chevron, its global fleet of plants earned just US$1.7 billion last year, down from US$6.1 billion.\n\nThe fourth quarter was especially stark for Chevron\u2019s US refineries, which lost almost US$350 million, according to a company release.\n\n\u201cThe largest downside surprise came from the oil major\u2019s US refining segment, which reported its first quarterly loss since early 2021 and was well below expectations,\u201d said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge.\n\nExxon shares rose 0.8 per cent at 9.33 am in New York. Chevron fell 2.5 per cent.\n\nLevies on Canada and Mexico could curtail shipments of roughly four million barrels a day of oil from the north and 500,000 barrels a day from the south. The nations are the top two sources of foreign crude for US refiners.\n\nValero Energy, the third-largest independent US refiner by market value, on Thursday warned that the industry may cut fuel production if Trump carries out his tariff threat. Mexico is Valero\u2019s biggest source of oil. Independent refiners are those that don\u2019t drill for crude.\n\nAcross all its business lines, Exxon posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of US$1.67 a share that exceeded the consensus forecast by 12 cents.\n\nChevron, meanwhile, reported quarterly earnings of US$2.06 a share, a nickel below expectations. The miss came a day after competitor Shell also disclosed disappointing end-of-year profits.\n\nExxon surprised investors last month by raising capital spending to more than US$30 billion annually over the next five years as CEO Darren Woods expands production to levels not seen since the 1970s.\n\nWoods has argued that new oil projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin, along with liquefied natural gas investments, have such high margins that they will drive Exxon\u2019s breakeven oil price down to just US$30 a barrel by the end of the decade, ensuring profitability however the energy transition pans out.\n\nThe international Brent crude benchmark averaged roughly US$74 a barrel during the fourth quarter, down 11 per cent from a year earlier. The slide pressured the biggest oil companies\u2019 capacity to fund shareholder-friendly outlays such as dividends.\n\nExxon generated US$36 billion of free cash in 2024 and handed nearly all of it to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, making it the sixth-highest cash distributor in the S&P 500 Index. The company intends to buy back US$20 billion of shares annually through 2026.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing higher and higher production but that production is coming at lower cost of supply, higher profit barrels,\u201d chief financial officer Kathy Mikells said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that all barrels are not created equal and ours are very advantaged.\u201d\n\nChevron raised dividends by 5 per cent even as profit underperformed. The company generated US$4.4 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, short of the roughly US$7.5 billion doled out in the form of dividends and buybacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building from strength to strength and have US$10 billion of additional free cash flow growth through the end of 2026,\u201d Wirth said. New projects in Kazakhstan and the newly named Gulf of America will drive the increase, he said. BLOOMBERG",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Surpasses Earnings Estimates Amid Lower Oil Prices Higher production from the Permian basin and Guyana boosts Exxon\u2019s profitability against market challenges.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation has reported fourth-quarter earnings surpassing Wall Street's expectations, as increased oil and gas production compensated for lower oil prices and refining margins. The oil giant revealed adjusted profits of $7.39 billion, translating to $1.67 per share, exceeding analyst projections of $1.56 per share, and showcasing the resilience of its operational strategy during challenging market conditions.\n\nDespite the challenges faced over the year, Exxon\u2019s overall earnings for the entirety of 2024 stood at $33.46 billion, down from $38.57 billion the previous year. This decrease aligns with broader trends affecting the oil industry, including volatile market conditions and fluctuated prices.\n\nOne of the standout elements of Exxon\u2019s performance was its ambitious production levels, particularly from its operations within the Permian basin and Guyana. Following its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources earlier in the year, Exxon solidified its position as the largest oil producer within the Permian basin, the largest oilfield across the U.S. Production reportedly peaked at 4.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the last quarter of 2024, up by 20,000 barrels compared to the previous quarter.\n\nWhile the production results speak volumes about Exxon's efficiency, the crude oil segment's financial prospects have struggled significantly. Profits from gasoline and diesel production, for example, plummeted to just $323 million, starkly contrasting the $3.2 billion earned the previous year. This reflects the broader global trend of oversupply as newly operational refineries across Asia and Africa have flooded the market, significantly impacting demand predictions for fuel products.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re watching as we look ahead to 2025,\u201d remarked Kathryn Mikells, Exxon's Chief Financial Officer, as she discussed the company's outlook amid growing refinery pressure. This acknowledgment reflects the caution among industry leaders as they navigate uncertainties within the energy market.\n\nThe company also faced impairment charges totaling approximately $608 million for the fourth quarter due to asset sales, including joint ventures, such as one based in Nigeria. These strategic asset sell-offs seek to streamline operations and align with Exxon's focus on high-value projects, particularly amid the prospective acquisition appeals from competing firms.\n\nFurther highlighting the firm's financial strategies, Exxon announced substantial shareholder returns totaling $36 billion for 2024, which included stock buybacks and dividends, contrasting with the $32 billion distributed to shareholders the prior year. These returns were supported by Exxon's free cash flow, which amounted to $36.2 billion, confirming the company\u2019s commitment to rewarding its investors even within tighter margins.\n\nThis proactive approach to shareholder value also includes plans to repurchase $20 billion worth of shares annually until 2026, signaling confidence from the leadership as they continue to navigate the market's volatility.\n\nThe backdrop of this successful performance stands against Exxon\u2019s distinctly advantageous position, with plans to expedite investments across regions known for high-margin oil projects. Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods noted the strategic focus on new developments, especially within Guyana and the Permian Basin, emphasizing the corporate ambition to boost production to levels not seen since the 1970s.\n\nWoods\u2019 assertions are underpinned by the significant profitability of new oil projects and liquefied natural gas (LNG) investments, directing the company as it endeavors to adapt successfully amid the progressive energy transition policies globally.\n\nExxon\u2019s competitive positioning is magnified as it contrasts actions taken by rivals, with Chevron\u2014another industry titan\u2014reported to have posted losses within its refining segment for the first time since 2020, mirroring broader operational challenges among peers.\n\nThe overall sentiment among analysts indicates mixed results across the sector, particularly as investors recalibrate expectations following decreased performance observations earlier within the fiscal year. With pressures arising from higher production costs and mixed results, the road to maintaining profitability remains fraught with challenges.\n\nLooking forward, the energy sector is poised to see additional shifts\u2014notably with the anticipated arbitration decision related to Chevron\u2019s acquisition of Hess, which may influence market dynamics should there be favorable outcomes for competitors involved.\n\nExon\u2019s resilience, as reflected in its fourth-quarter results, reassures investors during turbulent market conditions, fostering optimism for sustained profitability amid fluctuated oil pricing and refining pressures. This enduring commitment to strategic growth, shareholder rewards, and adaptability characterizes Exxon Mobil as it forges its path through the intricacies of the modern energy economy.",

Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments.

According to a recent report, the oil and gas giant is leveraging its comprehensive system for capturing, transporting, and storing CO2 as a key advantage in building decarbonized gas-fired plants.\n\nOn a call with analysts, CEO Darren Woods highlighted Exxon's commitment to accelerating project schedules to meet the demands of major tech companies\u2014like Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and Meta\u2014that are investing extensively in artificial intelligence. With plans to have a site operational by 2028 and fully decarbonized by 2029, Exxon aims to set a new industry standard for speed and efficiency.\n\nCompetition in this sector is heating up as Chevron, another Fortune 500 company, announced its partnership with Engine No. 1 to develop gas-fired power plants designed to reduce carbon emissions for data centers across the U.S. Southeast, Midwest, and West regions. According to IndexBox data, the demand for decarbonized power solutions continues to rise, with expectations of substantial growth in the energy market driven by AI advancements.\n\nThis ongoing transition highlights Exxon's unique position in global energy innovation, with its pioneering carbon capture and storage system on the U.S. Gulf Coast representing a new frontier in carbon management technologies. As discussions with potential customers continue, Exxon's comprehensive strategy could potentially redefine decarbonization in the sector and solidify its leadership in this emerging market.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

Unfavorable 2023 identified items included a $2.0 billion impairment in California due to regulatory challenges restarting production and distribution from the now-divested Santa Ynez Unit assets. Earnings excluding identified items decreased as industry refining margins and natural gas prices declined from last year's historically high levels. Strong advantaged volume growth including record production from Guyana and Permian, and record high-value product sales volumes, more than offset lower base volumes from non-strategic asset divestments and scheduled maintenance. Structural cost savings partly offset higher expenses from depreciation, scheduled maintenance, new product development and 2025 project start-ups.\n\nSince 2019, the company achieved 12.1 billion of cumulative Structural Cost Savings, well beyond what any competitors have achieved, and more than offsetting inflation and growth. This includes $2.4 billion of savings during the year and $0.8 billion during the quarter. The company expects to deliver $18 billion of cumulative savings through the end of 2030 versus 2019.\n\nReturn on capital employed led industry for the year at 12.7% and for the five-year average at 10.8% 2 .\n\n.

Identified items for the year improved earnings by $0.2 billion versus the unfavorable $2.3 billion impact in 2023 mainly driven by the impairment of the now-divested Santa Ynez Unit assets in California due to regulatory challenges restarting production and distribution. Excluding identified items, earnings increased $1.6 billion due to advantaged assets volume growth from record Guyana and Permian production, and structural cost savings. These increases were partly offset by lower natural gas prices, higher depreciation expense, and lower base volumes from divestments of non-strategic assets and entitlements. Net production in 2024 was at the highest level in over ten years at 4.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 16%, or 595,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings were $6.5 billion, an increase of $340 million from the third quarter driven by record production in Guyana and Permian, stronger natural gas prices, and favorable tax impacts, partly offset by lower crude realizations. Net production in the fourth quarter was 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 20,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day versus the prior quarter.\n\nEnergy Products 4Q24 3Q24 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) 2024 2023 Earnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP) 296 517 United States 2,099 6,123 106 792 Non-U.S. 1,934 6,019 402 1,309 Worldwide 4,033 12,142 Earnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) 330 517 United States 2,133 5,931 (7) 792 Non-U.S. 1,821 6,067 323 1,309 Worldwide 3,954 11,998 5,537 5,580 Energy Products Sales (kbd) 5,418 5,461\n\nEnergy Products full-year 2024 earnings were $4.0 billion compared to $12.1 billion in 2023 due to significantly weaker industry refining margins, which declined from historically high levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand. Earnings improvement from structural cost savings and advantaged projects provided a partial offset to the impacts from higher scheduled maintenance and divestments.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings totaled $402 million, a decrease of $907 million from the third quarter. Results were driven by unfavorable timing effects mainly from the absence of prior quarter favorable unsettled derivative mark-to-market impacts and weaker North America margins, partly offset by higher base volumes on strong reliability and recovery from the tornado at the Joliet refinery.\n\nChemical Products 4Q24 3Q24 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) 2024 2023 Earnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP) 230 367 United States 1,627 1,626 (110) 526 Non-U.S. 950 11 120 893 Worldwide 2,577 1,637 Earnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) 273 367 United States 1,670 1,594 (58) 526 Non-U.S. 1,002 431 215 893 Worldwide 2,672 2,025 4,635 4,830 Chemical Products Sales (kt) 19,392 19,382\n\nChemical Products 2024 earnings were $2.6 billion, an increase of $940 million versus 2023. Unfavorable 2023 identified items of $388 million were mainly associated with asset impairments and other financial reserves. 2024 earnings excluding identified items increased by $647 million compared to 2023. Despite continued bottom-of-cycle market conditions, overall margins improved as the company benefited from lower ethane feed costs at its advantaged North America assets and improved high-value product sales and realizations. Record high-value product sales more than offset lower base volumes from high-grading the portfolio product mix. Higher expenses primarily from planned maintenance and cost associated with advantaged projects starting up in 2025 were partly offset by structural cost savings.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings were $120 million, compared to $893 million in the third quarter driven by weaker margins from increased North America ethane feed costs, seasonally higher expenses, and China Chemical Complex start-up preparation costs.\n\nSpecialty Products 4Q24 3Q24 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) 2024 2023 Earnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP) 350 375 United States 1,576 1,536 396 419 Non-U.S. 1,476 1,178 746 794 Worldwide 3,052 2,714 Earnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) 354 375 United States 1,580 1,524 405 419 Non-U.S. 1,485 1,283 759 794 Worldwide 3,065 2,807 1,814 1,959 Specialty Products Sales (kt) 7,666 7,597\n\nSpecialty Products delivered consistently strong earnings from its portfolio of high-value products. 2024 earnings were $3.1 billion, an increase of $338 million compared with 2023 driven by improved basestock and finished lubes margins, structural cost savings, and record high-value product sales volumes. These increases were partly offset by higher expenses including new product development costs, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, and the absence of prior year favorable year-end inventory effects.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings were $746 million, compared to $794 million in the third quarter.

Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $12.1 billion, which included an additional $2.4 billion in 2024. The total change between periods in expenses above will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market drivers, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Estimates of cumulative annual structural cost savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural cost savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.\n\nExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other matters during a webcast at 8:30 a.m. Central Time on January 31, 2025.

Similarly, discussion of future carbon capture, transportation and storage, as well as biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia, lithium, direct air capture, and other low carbon business plans to reduce emissions of ExxonMobil, its affiliates, and third parties, are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress, stable policy support and timely rule-making and permitting, and represent forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including financial and operating performance; potential earnings, cash flow, or rate of return; total capital expenditures and mix, including allocations of capital to low carbon investments; realization and maintenance of structural cost reductions and efficiency gains, including the ability to offset inflationary pressure; plans to reduce future emissions and emissions intensity; ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net zero from operated assets by 2050, to reach Scope 1 and 2 net zero in heritage Upstream Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030 and in Pioneer Permian assets by 2035, to eliminate routine flaring in-line with World Bank Zero Routine Flaring, to reach near-zero methane emissions from its operated assets and other methane initiatives, to meet ExxonMobil\u2019s emission reduction goals and plans, divestment and start-up plans, and associated project plans as well as technology advances, including the timing and outcome of projects to capture and store CO2, produce hydrogen and ammonia, produce biofuels, produce lithium, create new advanced carbon materials, and use plastic waste as feedstock for advanced recycling; cash flow, dividends and shareholder returns, including the timing and amounts of share repurchases; future debt levels and credit ratings; business and project plans, timing, costs, capacities and returns; resource recoveries and production rates; and planned Pioneer and Denbury integrated benefits, could differ materially due to a number of factors. These include global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market factors, economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations that impact prices and differentials for our products; changes in any part of the world in law, taxes, or regulation including environmental and tax regulations, trade sanctions, and timely granting of governmental permits and certifications; the development or changes in government policies supporting lower carbon and new market investment opportunities or policies limiting the attractiveness of future investment such as the additional European taxes on the energy sector and unequal support for different methods of emissions reduction; variable impacts of trading activities on our margins and results each quarter; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the outcome of commercial negotiations, including final agreed terms and conditions; the ability to access debt markets; the ultimate impacts of public health crises, including the effects of government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance, including variability and timing factors applicable to unconventional resources and the success of new unconventional technologies; the level and outcome of exploration projects and decisions to invest in future reserves; timely completion of development and other construction projects; final management approval of future projects and any changes in the scope, terms, or costs of such projects as approved; government regulation of our growth opportunities; war, civil unrest, attacks against the company or industry and other political or security disturbances; expropriations, seizure, or capacity, insurance or shipping limitations by foreign governments or laws; changes in market tariffs or decoupling of trade networks; changes in market strategy by national oil companies; opportunities for potential acquisitions, investments or divestments and satisfaction of applicable conditions to closing, including timely regulatory approvals; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to maintain near-term cost reductions as ongoing efficiencies; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties and unplanned maintenance; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs and the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of ExxonMobil\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil\u2019s 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company\u2019s Global Outlook research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and deployment of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Global Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Company\u2019s business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by the corporation or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nForward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or requiring disclosure in our filing with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making. The release is provided under consistent SEC disclosure requirements and should not be misinterpreted as applying to any other disclosure standards.\n\nFrequently Used Terms and Non-GAAP Measures\n\nThis press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales (non-GAAP). Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, the company believes it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the 2023 and 2024 periods is shown on page 6.\n\nThis press release also includes cash flow from operations excluding working capital (non-GAAP), and cash flow from operations and asset sales excluding working capital (non-GAAP). The company believes it is useful for investors to consider these numbers in comparing the underlying performance of the company's business across periods when there are significant period-to-period differences in the amount of changes in working capital. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the 2023 and 2024 periods is shown on page 6.\n\nThis press release also includes Earnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP), which are earnings/(loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings/(loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings/(loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for identified items. When the effect of these events is significant in aggregate, it is indicated in analysis of period results as part of quarterly earnings press release and teleconference materials. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income/(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation to each of corporate earnings and segment earnings are shown for 2024 and 2023 periods in Attachments II-a and II-b. Earnings per share amounts are shown on page 1 and in Attachment II-a, including a reconciliation to earnings/(loss) per common share \u2013 assuming dilution (U.S. GAAP).\n\nThis press release also includes total taxes including sales-based taxes. This is a broader indicator of the total tax burden on the Corporation\u2019s products and earnings, including certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (\u201csales-based taxes\u201d). It combines \u201cIncome taxes\u201d and \u201cTotal other taxes and duties\u201d with sales-based taxes, which are reported net in the income statement. The company believes it is useful for the Corporation and its investors to understand the total tax burden imposed on the Corporation\u2019s products and earnings. A reconciliation to total taxes is shown in Attachment I-a.\n\nThis press release also references free cash flow (non-GAAP) and free cash flow excluding working capital (non-GAAP). Free cash flow is the sum of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash flow used in investing activities excluding cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions, and inflows from noncontrolling interests for major projects from financing activities. These measures are useful when evaluating cash available for financing activities, including shareholder distributions, after investment in the business. Free cash flow and free cash flow excluding working capital are not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities for the 2023 and 2024 periods is shown on page 6.\n\nThis press release also references cash capex (non-GAAP). Cash capex is the sum of additions to property, plant and equipment; additional investments and advances; and other investing activities including collection of advances; reduced by inflows from noncontrolling interests for major projects, each from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The company believes it is a useful measure for investors to understand the cash impact of investments in the business, which is in line with standard industry practice. A breakdown of cash capex is shown in Attachment V.\n\nReferences to resources or resource base may include quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as quantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term \u201cresource base\u201d or similar terms are not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as \u201cprobable\u201d or \u201cpossible\u201d reserves. A reconciliation of production excluding divestments, entitlements, and government mandates to actual production is contained in the Supplement to this release included as Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K filed the same day as this news release.\n\nThis press release also references return on average capital employed (ROCE) (non-GAAP). The Corporation's total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil, excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash-flow based, are used to make investment decisions. A reconciliation to net income/(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil and to Total assets for 2023 and 2024 periods are shown on page 7.\n\nThe term \u201cproject\u201d as used in this news release can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Projects or plans may not reflect investment decisions made by the company. Individual opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, technology for cost-effective abatement, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. The company may refer to these opportunities as projects in external disclosures at various stages throughout their progression.\n\nAdvantaged assets (Advantaged growth projects) when used in reference to the Upstream business, includes Permian (heritage Permian and Pioneer), Guyana, and LNG.\n\nAdvantaged projects refers to capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\n\nBase portfolio (Base) in our Upstream segment, refers to assets (or volumes) other than advantaged assets (or volumes from advantaged assets). In our Energy Products segment, refers to assets (or volumes) other than advantaged projects (or volumes from advantaged projects). In our Chemical Products and Specialty Products segments refers to volumes other than high-value products volumes.\n\nDebt-to-capital ratio is total debt divided by the sum of total debt and equity. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nGovernment mandates (curtailments) are changes to ExxonMobil\u2019s sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.\n\nHeritage Permian: Permian basin assets excluding assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources that closed in May 2024.\n\nHigh-value products includes performance products and lower-emission fuels.\n\nLower-emission fuels are fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\n\nNet-debt-to-capital ratio is net debt divided by the sum of net debt and total equity, where net debt is total debt net of cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nPerformance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users.\n\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) measures the change in value of an investment in common stock over a specified period of time, assuming dividend reinvestment. Shareholder return over a particular measurement period is calculated by: dividing (1) the sum of (a) the cumulative value of dividends received during the measurement period, assuming reinvestment, plus (b) the difference between the stock price at the end and at the beginning of the measurement period; by (2) the stock price at the beginning of the measurement period. Unless stated otherwise, dividends are assumed to be reinvested in stock at market prices at approximately the same time actual dividends are paid and total shareholder return is quoted on an annualized basis.\n\nThis press release also references Structural Cost Savings, for more details see page 8.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, year-to-date (\u201cYTD\u201d) means as of the last business day of the most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nReference to Earnings\n\nReferences to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, Specialty Products and Corporate and Financing earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil\u2019s share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, Esso, and XTO. For convenience and simplicity, those terms and terms such as Corporation, company, our, we, and its are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or affiliate groups. Similarly, ExxonMobil has business relationships with thousands of customers, suppliers, governments, and others. For convenience and simplicity, words such as venture, joint venture, partnership, co-venturer, and partner are used to indicate business and other relationships involving common activities and interests, and those words may not indicate precise legal relationships. ExxonMobil's ambitions, plans and goals do not guarantee any action or future performance by its affiliates or Exxon Mobil Corporation's responsibility for those affiliates' actions and future performance, each affiliate of which manages its own affairs.\n\nThroughout this press release, both Exhibit 99.1 as well as Exhibit 99.2, due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n\nATTACHMENT I-a CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (Preliminary)\n\nDollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) Three Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Twelve Months

It earned $7.63 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the prior-year period.\n\nRemoving one time costs and charges, earnings were $1.67 per share.\n\nThe results topped Wall Street expectations, though Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research anticipated earnings of $1.55 per share.\n\nExxon Mobil said Friday that excluding one-time charges and benefits, earnings rose $1.6 billion due to growth on record production in Guyana, in South America, and in America\u2019s Permian basin, as well as structural cost savings.\n\nRevenue totaled $83.43 billion, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $87.12 billion.\n\nExxon\u2019s net production hit 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the quarter, an increase of 20,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day compared with the previous quarter.\n\nKathy Mikells, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in prepared remarks that more than 50% of production in 2024 came from the Permian basin, Guyana, and from liquid natural gas.\n\nThe company anticipates that more than 60% of its volumes will be generated from its assets in the Permian, Guyana, and liquid natural gas by 2030, she added.\n\nIn December OPEC+ delayed increasing oil production as it faces weaker than expected demand and competing production from non-allied countries. The alliance decided at an online meeting to postpone production increases that had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. The plan had been to start gradually restoring 2.2 million barrels per day over the course of 2025.\n\nThat process will now be pushed back to April 1, 2025 and production increases will gradually take place over 18 months until October 2026.\n\nShares of Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Spring, Texas, were essentially flat before the opening bell Friday.",

This compares to earnings of $2.48 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.74%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and natural gas company would post earnings of $1.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.92, delivering a surprise of 0.52%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nExxon , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, posted revenues of $83.43 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $84.34 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nExxon shares have added about 1.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Exxon?\n\nWhile Exxon has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Exxon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.80 on $86.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.65 on $352.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil on Friday beat Wall Street's estimate for fourth-quarter profit as higher oil and gas production offset lower oil prices and weaker refining margins.\n\nIts adjusted profit was $7.39 billion or $1.67 per share, beating analyst estimates of $1.56, LSEG data showed.\n\nExxon's low production costs in the basin and its lucrative and prolific projects in Guyana have bolstered the company's profits despite lower oil prices and a decline in profits on making fuel. The company became the largest oil producer in the Permian basin in 2024, the biggest U.S. oilfield, after closing its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in May.\n\nThe No. 1 U.S. oil producer reported earnings of $33.46 billion for 2024, down from $38.57 billion the year earlier. Exxon shares were unchanged in trading before the bell on Friday.\n\nIts fourth-quarter adjusted earnings from oil and gas production were $6.28 billion, up from $4.15 billion in the same quarter last year. Production reached 4.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, growing from 4.58 million in the third quarter.\n\nProduction of crude oil and natural gas liquids in the United States grew almost 2% from the previous quarter to 1.47 million barrels per day.\n\nBut earnings from producing gasoline and diesel were $323 million, a large fall from $3.2 billion a year earlier. The startup of new oil refineries by other companies in Asia and Africa led to higher global fuel supply, even as demand for gasoline and diesel lagged expectations.\n\nThe refining business remains under pressure as the additional supply enters the market, Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said in an interview.\n\n\"That's really what we're watching as we look ahead to 2025,\" she said.\n\nExxon's results were helped by lower corporate costs and showed mixed performance across the business, said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a research note on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, Chevron , the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported a loss in its refining business for the first time since 2020 and missed Wall Street's earnings estimates.\n\nExxon said impairments across the business cost $608 million in the fourth quarter. The charges come from selling assets, including a joint venture in Nigeria, Mikells said.\n\nThe company continues to expect a decision by September in its arbitration challenge to Chevron's acquisition of oil producer Hess, she said. If Chevron proceeds, it would gain a foothold in Guyana's oil projects.\n\nWhile the deal has been approved by U.S. regulators, Exxon and China's CNOOC, Hess' partners in the Guyana oil joint venture, say they have a contractual first right to buy Hess' stake.\n\nShareholder returns via buybacks and dividends totaled $36 billion in 2024, up from $32 billion.\n\nThe shareholder distributions, a cornerstone of Big Oil's strategy to court investors, were covered by Exxon's free cash flow of $36.2 billion. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion in shares annually through 2026.\n\nEarnings from producing chemical products were $215 million, up from $189 million a year earlier. Exxon said earnings from specialty products was $759 million, also up from $650 million in the year-ago quarter.",

            "content": "Spring, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) operates as the largest American oil & gas company. It engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and internationally. Valued at a $474.8 billion market cap, Exxon operates through Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments.\n\nThe energy giant has notably underperformed the broader market past year. XOM stock has gained 5.4% over the past 52 weeks compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 22.6% surge during the same time frame. On a YTD basis, XOM has increased nearly 1%, lagging behind the SPX\u2019s 2.7% gains.\n\nNarrowing the focus, although Exxon has surpassed the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF\u2019s (XOP) 2.9% gains over the past year, it has underperformed XOP\u2019s 4.4% returns on a YTD basis.\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s stock prices dipped nearly 1.6% after the release of its Q3 results on Nov. 1. The company observed a marginal 82 basis point decline in topline compared to the year-ago quarter to $90 billion which missed the Street\u2019s expectations by a notable margin. While the company\u2019s results were impacted due to a slump in oil margins, it was mostly offset by record liquids production in over 40 years with 3.2 million barrels per day and record high-value product sales volumes in Product Solutions. This led to its adjusted EPS of $1.92 surpassing the consensus estimates by a small margin.\n\nExxon is set to unveil its full-year earnings before the market opens tomorrow, and analysts anticipate an 18.7% year-over-year decline in its adjusted EPS to $7.74. XOM\u2019s earnings surprise history is mixed. While the company has surpassed the consensus estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it has missed the projections on one other occasion.\n\nHowever, analysts remain optimistic about the stock\u2019s longer-term prospects. XOM has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Among the 24 analysts covering the stock, 15 recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d eight suggest \u201cHold,\u201d and one advises a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nThis configuration is slightly more bullish than two months ago when 14 analysts recommended a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating.\n\nOn Jan. 13, Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating on the stock, while raising the price target to $119.\n\nXOM\u2019s mean price target of $129.91 indicates a 19.5% premium to current price levels. While its street-high target of $147 suggests a 35.3% upside potential.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Exxon will hold a conference call for investors at 8:30 a.m. CST, and Chevron will host a call at 10:00 a.m. CST.\n\nCrude oil prices (/CL) were little-changed from October to December, rising about 4% through the reporting period. While prices did nearly reach $80 per barrel in October, they traded mostly flat around 70 in November and December. WTI futures did manage to rebound in January alongside rising crack spreads, which may help the stocks\u2019 performances if that trend continues.\n\nBoth Exxon and Chevron fell through fourth-quarter trading following Q3 earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do investors expect?\n\nAnalysts expect Exxon to post earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55 for the fourth quarter. That would be down from an EPS of $2.48 reported last year. Revenue is expected to cross the wires at $86.33 billion, which would be up from $84.34 billion last year, according to TradingView.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Exxon has beaten EPS estimates in three periods, while it beat revenue expectations twice over the same period.\n\nAmong analysts, the one-year price target for Exxon averages $129.04, or an 18.5% increase from Thursday\u2019s $108.93 stock price. Twenty analysts have issued a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the stock, 11 have given it a \u201chold\u201d rating and only one consigned it to a \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nFor Chevron, analysts see EPS coming in at $2.11, while revenue is expected to total $46.6 billion. That would be down from EPS of $3.45 and revenue of $47.18 billion a year ago.\n\nChevron has beaten EPS and revenue estimates in three of the last four reporting periods.\n\nThe average one-year price target for Chevron among analysts is 177.39, or a 13.24% increase from Thursday\u2019s stock price of 156.65. Nineteen analysts have a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock while 10 have a \u201chold rating.\u201d There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cstrong sell\u201d ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Exxon XOM earnings\n\nExxon is trading about 1.6% higher on the month after dropping 8.8% in December, which marked the biggest monthly decline since October 2023.\n\nThe 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossed below the longer-term 200-day SMA back in December, a bearish technical signal known as a death cross. Since then, XOM has traded below the falling 50-day SMA, although prices have recovered somewhat since the death cross generated. That said, prices need to recapture the 50-day SMA before it could stage a recovery.\n\nThe options market expects a move of +/- 2.12 points, or 2% of the current stock price. That is a much smaller expected move compared to companies in the S&P 500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Chevron earnings\n\nChevron is trading in an advantaged technical structure vs. XOM, with prices holding above the 50- and 200-day SMAs. CVX is up over 8% since the start of the year, steadily outpacing XOM. A bull flag pattern has taken shape over the last two weeks of trading, indicating a potential breakout to the upside is on the cards.\n\nThe expected move for CVX per the options market calls for +/- 3.04 points, or 2% of Thursday\u2019s 156.78 stock price. This is about the same as XOM and doesn\u2019t offer many options for traders selling premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

The estimate was revised downward by six analysts in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $87.1 billion, suggesting a 3.3% uptick from the year-ago actuals.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nXOM beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, with the average surprise being 2.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nQ4 Earnings Whispers for XOM\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t predict an earnings beat for XOM this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

This projection seems reasonable, given that crude oil prices were stronger in the fourth quarter of 2023. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d), the monthly average WTI spot prices for October, November and December 2024 were $71.99, $69.95, and $70.12 per barrel, respectively, compared with $85.64, $77.69, and $71.90 per barrel, in the year-ago months.\n\nXOM also expects a lower industry refining margin to hurt its earnings from the Energy Products business segment in the December quarter by $0.3 billion to $0.7 billion compared to the previous quarter.\n\nXOM\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\n\nXOM's stock has soared 9.3% over the past year compared with the industry\u2019s rise of 7.4%. BP plc BP, another integrated energy major, has declined 6.4% over the same time frame, while Chevron Corporation CVX, in the same space, has gained 10.1%.\n\nOne-Year Price Chart\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith the price increase, XOM appears relatively overvalued. The company's current trailing 12-month enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio is 6.43, which is trading at a premium compared to the industry average of 4.05.",

One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Exxon Mobil moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nNYSE:XOM Earnings Per Share Growth January 29th 2025\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Exxon Mobil's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Exxon Mobil, it has a TSR of 130% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nExxon Mobil provided a TSR of 6.6% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 18% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.",

The expansion is expected to increase output to nealry 1 million barrels of oil per day, or approximately 1% of the global crude supply, reported Reuters on Jan. 24.\n\nDue to high sulphur levels and harsh weather conditions, Tengiz is one of the world\u2019s deepest and most complex fields. The expansion will significantly boost Tengiz\u2019s production capacity, though it has faced delays and cost overruns since its inception in 2012.\n\nChevron\u2019s head of international exploration and production Clay Neff told Reuters that the expansion is expected to reach full capacity of 260,000 barrels per day by June, lifting overall production at Tengiz to around 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n\nChevron owns a 50% stake in the Tengizchevroil joint venture, which it operates. Exxon Mobil holds 25%, Kazakh oil firm KazMunayGas 20% and Russian oil producer Lukoil the remaining 5%.\n\nNeff said that Tengizchevroil is expected to generate $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion next year at an average Brent price of $60 a barrel. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently trading at around $80 a barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this project allows us to do is not only increase production today but also extend the life of the field over time,\u201d Neff told Reuters.\n\nThe expansion is part of Chevron\u2019s plans to increase its production by around 3% per year over the next five years, along with strong growth in the U.S. Permian shale basin.",

The turbines were acquired under a slot reservation agreement\u2014a contract that allows a buyer to reserve a specific time slot for a service or activity\u2014to support an accelerated deployment timeline.\n\nUS oil and gas major Chevron and San Francisco-based hedge fund Engine No. 1 have partnered to develop and scale natural gas-powered power plants to serve co-located data centers in the Southeast, Midwest, and West of the US.\n\nAccording to reporting from the FT, the project is expected to cost up to $8 billion.\n\nThe partnership aims to develop up to 4GW, with an in-service target date at the end of 2027. If the initial deployment is successful, the companies suggest that there is potential for further expansion.\n\nChris James, founder and chief investment officer of Engine No. 1, said: \u201cEnergy is the key to America\u2019s AI dominance. By using abundant domestic natural gas to generate electricity directly connected to data centers, we can secure AI leadership, drive productivity gains across our economy, and restore America\u2019s standing as an industrial superpower.\u201d\n\nThe power generated by the turbines will directly feed the data centers in an off-grid system. The project will also be designed with the ability to integrate carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce its emission profile, the release stated. Chevron has invested in several CCS projects to date. Most recently, in April, it announced a direct investment in CCS firm ION Clean Energy.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pro-American energy policies and commitment to energy and AI dominance give us the confidence to invest in projects that will create American jobs and strengthen our national security,\u201d Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron, said.\n\nEngine No. 1 is an activist and impact-focused investment firm founded in 2020. In 2021, it became the talk of Wall Street in its campaign against fossil fuel giant ExxonMobil\u2019s board. The firm demanded reform in its focus on fossil fuels, arguing that it threatened future returns.\n\nDespite owning only 0.02 percent of the company, Engine No. 1 convinced Exxon's three largest shareholders, Blackrock, Vanguard, and Slate Street, to back the plans. This led Exxon to expand its board, add a director with a background in sustainable investing, and invest in CCS.\n\nReacting to the partnership with Chevron, Chris James argued that the investment is consistent with the Exxon campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not a pivot. The Exxon campaign was focused on governance and capital allocation as a way to create value for shareholders. It was not about ideology or fossil fuels or renewables,\u201d James told the FT.\n\n\u201cThis partnership with Chevron and GE is about allocating capital in an economy that is undergoing a re-industrialisation and needs dramatically more power . . . This will lead to value creation for shareholders.\u201d\n\nNotably, Chevron\u2019s deal with Engine No. 1 follows ExxonMobil's commitment to developing natural gas capacity specifically for the data center sector. In December, Exxon revealed it was planning to develop a 1.5GW natural gas-fired power plant dedicated to the data center sector.\n\nThe announcements by both oil and gas companies reflect a broader market move, as natural gas demand increases to meet the rising energy demand of artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nWith the reelection of Donald Trump to the presidency, the expectation is that regulations for new gas generation and pipelines will be streamlined to make good on his promise to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d Data centers stand to be one of the primary beneficiaries of this move.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that the first Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, would be directly powered by an onsite natural gas. Developers of the project submitted an application to site a 360.5MW power plant that will feed the data center behind the meter.\n\nLate last year, Meta announced a new $10 billion data center in Richland Parish, northeast Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana will build and operate 2.26GW of on-site natural gas generation, which will power the center.",

Last year, the Australian mining tycoon turned green campaigner doubled down on his long-running war with Meta \u2013 suing the social media platform for failing to prevent numerous scams on its platforms. Now he is in the cross hairs of ExxonMobil, which has accused Forrest and others of orchestrating \u201csmear campaigns\u201d for \u201cpublicity and personal gain\u201d.\n\nForrest himself is not a defendant in the defamation case, notes The Guardian. But he is \u201cmentioned by name more than 20 times in the claim\u201d, which targets a Forrest-linked charity \u2013 the Intergenerational Environmental Justice Fund (IEJF) \u2013 as well as several California-based environmental groups. In a nod to Maga\u2019s preoccupations, Exxon alleges that Forrest harboured \u201ca dream of upending the American oil and gas industry\u201d. Twiggy\u2019s reaction is to bring it on. He claims to be \u201cpersonally delighted\u201d by the lawsuit if it means that the fossil-fuel behemoth opens itself up to cross-examination in court. Worth around $16 billion, Forrest certainly doesn\u2019t lack the funds to give Exxon a run for its money. Neither is he short of dedication and persistence. When waging war on Meta, he created \u201ca mission-control-style room\u201d staffed around the clock by cybersecurity professionals, says The Wall Street Journal. Doubtless he\u2019ll deploy similar tenacity now.\n\nA \u201ccomplex personality\u201d, Forrest, 63, is a bundle of contradictions, says the Daily Mail. Despite making his fortune mining iron ore and building his company, Fortescue, into an operation valued at around $60 billion, he has emerged as a prominent climate warrior. Born in Western Australia and raised on the family property, Minderoo (after which he named his not-for-profit foundation), Forrest is descended from \u201cthe equivalent of state royalty\u201d. His great-great-grandfather was among four brothers who were the \u201cfounding parliamentarians\u201d of Western Australia.\n\nSubscribe to MoneyWeek Subscribe to MoneyWeek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely FREE Get 6 issues free Sign up to Money Morning Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Sign up\n\nIn the 1980s, he moved to Sydney and got into stockbroking, says Nikkei Asia. But the outback beckoned and \u201che turned his sights on Australia\u2019s mineral riches\u201d, buying his first mining venture, Anaconda Nickel, in 1993. As Forrest\u2019s biographer Andrew Burrell noted 20 years later, it was the start of a \u201chigh-stakes\u201d ride. The relationship between Anaconda and its key shareholder, the Swiss commodities group Glencore, was always \u201ctense\u201d, says the Australian Financial Review. But amid project delays and mounting debt, it drifted into \u201copen warfare\u201d. In the ensuing \u201cAnaconda squeeze\u201d in 2001, Forrest was forced to cede control amid losses of around $1 billion; shares plunged by around 89% from their peak. Forrest retreated to Europe but returned having spotted an opportunity to sell iron ore to fast-growing China. He gained control of a junior explorer for just $8 million, changed its name to Fortescue Metals, and set about building an empire.\n\nAndrew Forrest's big bet on green energy\n\nIn 2011, Forrest stepped down as CEO of Fortescue and he and his wife became the first Australian billionaires to pledge the majority of their wealth to charity. As well as green causes, they have majored in children\u2019s education, Aboriginal employment and a global campaign against human slavery. After a worldwide trip in 2020, \u201cForrest\u2019s green ambitions roared into a new phase\u201d, notes a profile by the Sydney investment company FC Capital.\n\nAs he describes it, \u201cI felt a change in the global mood, a shift in belief that the impossible could be possible\u201d. He responded by pushing audaciously into green hydrogen at Fortescue and beefing up his renewable energy company, Squadron Energy. Forrest\u2019s ultimate aim is to transform Australia into \u201ca renewable-energy superpower\u201d.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

This hydrogen would then be used to produce ammonia, which is commonly used as a fertilizer but also as a component in the manufacture of plastics, explosives and chemicals, among other uses.\n\nExxonMobil expects the project to be the world\u2019s biggest low-carbon hydrogen production plant with a capacity of one billion cubic feet a day of hydrogen, as well as over one million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) of ammonia.\n\nThe company expects to make a final investment decision this year and aims to put the facility into service 2029, \u201csubject to supportive government policy, regulatory permitting, and market conditions\u201d, said the statement posted on Trammo\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cOur Baytown project continues to make significant strides, attracting more and more customer interest\u201d, commented Barry Engle, president for low-carbon solutions at ExxonMobil.\n\nThe facility will be \u201ca win for America\u2019s Gulf Coast, creating jobs and enhancing U.S. energy exports\u201d, Engle added.\n\nChristophe Savi, president of Trammo\u2019s French subsidiary, said, \u201cBoth companies [ExxonMobil and Trammo] have a common interest in developing clean and decarbonized solutions for consumers worldwide, including the European market, and this partnership furthers Trammo\u2019s goal of making available in the market significant volumes of low-carbon ammonia by 2030\u201d.\n\nLast year Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) signed a deal to buy a 35 percent stake in the project.\n\n\"This strategic investment is a significant step for ADNOC as we grow our portfolio of lower-carbon energy sources and deliver on our international growth strategy\u201d, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, United Arab Emirates minister of industry and advanced technology and ADNOC chief executive, said in a joint statement with ExxonMobil September 4, 2024.\n\nExxonMobil is also in talks with Japanese firms JERA Co. Inc. and Mitsubishi Corp. on potential investment and purchase commitments for the project.\n\nMitsubishi plans to use supply from the project in the industrial sector in Japan, where it aims to handle about one MMtpa of low-carbon ammonia by 2030.\n\n\u201cMitsubishi Corporation aims to convert part of its liquified petroleum gas terminal into an ammonia terminal for transshipment, which will then supply the low-carbon ammonia to various industrial applications, such as power, automobile and chemical, mainly in the Shikoku and Chugoku regions in Japan\u201d, said a joint statement with ExxonMobil September 13, 2024.\n\nMitsubishi intends to rope in Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd. as an equity and offtake partner.\n\nOn March 25, 2024, JERA said it had agreed to pursue talks on potential participation and commitment to purchase around 500,000 tons a year from the project.\n\n\u201cJERA is playing an important role in the energy transition and is taking on the challenge of expanding renewable energy and developing zero-emission thermal power technologies\u201d, it said then.\n\nAir Liquide has also agreed to potentially invest $850 million to provide feedstock and transport support for the project.\n\nThe planned investment by the French maker of industrial gases and equipment hinges on supportive government policy and regulatory permits, as well as market conditions surrounding the project, according to separate statements by Air Liquide and ExxonMobil June 24, 2024.\n\nThe involvement of the French maker of industrial gases and equipment would span the construction, operation and ownership of four large modular air separation units (LMAs), as well as the provision of Air Liquide\u2019s existing pipeline network to transport hydrogen produced in the facility. The LMAs would supply 9,000 metric tons of oxygen and up to 6,500 metric tons of nitrogen daily to the facility.\n\n\u201cThis will enable Air Liquide to increase its oxygen production capacity by 50 percent in Texas\u201d, Air Liquide said. \u201cPending final investment decision, this major project would mark the largest industrial investment in the history of the Air Liquide Group.\n\n\u201cThis new Air Liquide Baytown low-carbon platform would serve primarily ExxonMobil with vast amounts of low-carbon oxygen and nitrogen, as well as significant volumes of argon and rare gases such as krypton and xenon for Air Liquide\u2019s other customers\u201d.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

Oil producers are recalibrating their strategies and leaning into power generation, a business that many of them had previously sworn off because it was much less profitable than drilling and processing oil and gas. Just last month, Exxon said that it, too, wanted to get into the business of selling electricity to data centers.\n\nBut in a reminder that the prospects for A.I. data centers and growing electricity demand are highly uncertain, technology and energy stocks tumbled on Monday. Investors were unnerved by the stunning advances in A.I. made by an unfamiliar Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, that said it had made its gains using a modest number of computer chips that consumed relatively little energy. Shares of chip-maker Nvidia tumbled 17 percent and the stock of Constellation Energy, a large power producer, closed down more than 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the potential for markets to surprise you,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. But he added that being early to market and keeping its costs low would protect Chevron against the possibility that power demand growth falls short of current expectations.\n\nHis company is hardly alone.\n\nMany power producers are bulking up, and many are investing in natural gas generating capacity specifically. Constellation, which has a large fleet of nuclear power plants, agreed this month to buy rival Calpine, which owns many natural gas plants, for $16.4 billion. And last week, NextEra Energy said it was planning to build more gas-fueled power plants.\n\nExpectations for how much and how quickly U.S. electricity demand will rise vary widely. What\u2019s clear is that data centers are likely to consume a lot more of the country\u2019s power than they do today.

The facility is expected to produce virtually carbon-free hydrogen\u2014with approximately 98% of carbon dioxide (CO2) removed and will use this low-carbon hydrogen to make low-carbon ammonia. Trammo, a leading international physical commodity trader, will leverage its market and logistical expertise to deliver and sell in Europe and worldwide this unique low-carbon ammonia for use as fertilizer feedstock and for other key industrial applications.\n\nThe facility is expected to be the world\u2019s largest of its kind, capable of producing up to 1 billion cubic feet (bcf) daily of low-carbon hydrogen and more than 1 million tons of low-carbon ammonia annually. A final investment decision by ExxonMobil is expected in 2025 with anticipated startup in 2029, subject to supportive government policy, regulatory permitting, and market conditions.\n\nBarry Engle, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, said :\n\nOur Baytown project continues to make significant strides, attracting more and more customer interest,\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with Trammo on this first-of-its-kind project which would be a win for America\u2019s Gulf Coast, creating jobs and enhancing U.S. energy exports.\u201d\n\nTrammo SAS President Christophe Savi said:\n\nTrammo is delighted to partner with ExxonMobil in the Baytown project and to sign this HOA.\n\n\u201cBoth companies have a common interest in developing clean and decarbonized solutions for consumers worldwide, including the European market, and this partnership furthers Trammo\u2019s goal of making available in the market significant volumes of low-carbon ammonia by 2030.\u201d\n\nREAD the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Central\n\nExxonMobil and Trammo sign HOA for low-carbon ammonia offtake, advancing the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen project, source",

            "content": "Wall Street expects U.S. oil and gas companies to keep a lid on spending in 2025 and keep their focus on generating shareholder returns, despite calls by President Donald Trump to \"drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nBig Oil begins reporting fourth-quarter results this week, and outlooks for the coming year should reflect the dissonance between Trump's oil and gas-maximizing agenda and investor expectations. The industry has pushed in recent years to drive down costs and increase production by using more efficient technology rather than drilling many new wells.\n\nProducers also must contend with lower global oil prices as the post-pandemic demand rebound runs its course and as China's economy struggles.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude oil prices LCOc1 are projected to average $74 per barrel in 2025, down from $81 in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nOverall, for the U.S. exploration and production sector, analysts at Scotiabank expect companies to target up to 5% production growth this year, and flat to slightly lower year-over-year capital expenditures.\n\nThe exception is Exxon Mobil, which plans a large increase in production. The largest U.S. oil company intends to more than triple its production in the Permian, the top U.S. shale field, and pump 1.3 million barrels per day from its lucrative operations in Guyana by 2030.\n\n\"We expect most oil and gas producers to remain disciplined with capital expenditures,\" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital. \"However, less regulation will make it easier to increase drilling activity if commodity prices reach levels that are too high.\"\n\nChevron, which reports results on Friday, is expected to grow production by about 3% this year and in the mid-single digit percentage in 2026, said Barclays analysts in a research note.\n\nThe company has followed a conservative strategy, moving out of a phase of heavy investment in new projects, and is now generating cash, said analysts from RBC Capital Markets in a note. Chevron could also announce a dividend increase of at least 5% over the previous year, Thummel added, as dividend increases have been between 6% to 8% previously.\n\nChevron is expected to report $3.87 billion in profit, according to data compiled by LSEG, which would be a decline from $6.45 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nExxon Mobil, meanwhile, is expected to report $6.85 billion in profit, down from $9.96 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company signaled last month that lower oil refining profits and weakness across its business would reduce earnings by about $1.75 billion compared to the third quarter.\n\nAn arbitration panel will decide in May on Exxon's challenge to Chevron's acquisition of Hess - a purchase that would give Chevron a rival stake in Guyana's rich offshore reserves. Exxon has claimed a contractual right to buy Hess' stake in the field.\n\nProducer ConocoPhillips could also grow oil and gas production in the low single-digit percentage this year to focus on returning cash to shareholders, Barclays said.\n\nThe company in December completed its $22.5 billion buyout of smaller peer Marathon Oil, which had been under a Federal Trade Commission review. This could, according to Scotiabank analysts, swing its performance up.\n\nOccidental, meanwhile, is expected to report $730.9 million in adjusted profit for the fourth quarter, up from $710 million in the same quarter last year. The oil producer closed its acquisition of CrownRock in August and its capex this year is expected to total $7.44 billion, up from $6.9 billion last year, Barclays said.\n\nFor Diamondback Energy, Raymond James analysts expect the company to choose free cash flow over growth after its acquisition of Endeavor. Profit is expected to come in at $977 million, up from $854 million in the same quarter last year. Production growth is expected to be flat with lesser spending in 2025, they added.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reuters - Reporting by Sheila Dang in Houston and Seher Dareen in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)",

            "content": "Donald Trump has officially been sworn (back) into office, and Wall Street is optimistic about his potential impact. Regardless of political preferences, all Americans must now consider how the Trump administration will influence global financial markets and their own investment portfolios. Throughout his campaign, Trump focused on several potential market-moving themes, including securing the border with Mexico, implementing aggressive tariffs on imports, supporting domestic oil and gas drilling, reducing regulations, cutting corporate taxes, and even investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency mining.\n\nHere are eight stocks to buy that could be big winners under President Donald Trump:\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. (ticker: DJT)\n\nMicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR)\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA)\n\nGEO Group Inc. (GEO)\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC)\n\nWells Fargo & Co. (WFC)\n\nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT)\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group is a media company focused on prioritizing free speech. It is the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, which was created in 2022 after Trump was kicked off Facebook and Twitter in 2021. Truth Social aims to serve as a safe harbor for free expression and create an alternative platform to the ones provided by Big Tech corporations. Since going public, the stock has tended to trade up or down based on Trump's political performance. Trump is the majority owner of Trump Media, so Truth Social should get plenty of promotion and visibility in coming years.\n\nMicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR)\n\nMicroStrategy's core business is a business intelligence software platform, but cryptocurrency enthusiasts know the company because MicroStrategy is also the largest corporate investor in Bitcoin. As of January 2025, the company held 461,000 BTC on its balance sheet, a stake worth more than $47 billion at today's Bitcoin prices. With Bitcoin prices up about 145% in the past year, it's easy to see why MicroStrategy shares have soared. Trump has pledged to support U.S. Bitcoin mining and prioritize digital asset regulations that will promote Bitcoin adoption. The higher Bitcoin prices rise, the higher MSTR stock should climb.\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

(TSLA)\n\nTrump has been a staunch supporter of the legacy U.S. auto industry in Detroit and has even said he would consider ending the government's $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. At first glance, it would seem a Trump presidency would be very bad news for the EV industry and its leader Tesla. However, savvy Tesla CEO Elon Musk has done everything in his power to gain Trump's favor, including endorsing him in speeches and at campaign events. Trump has a long history of rewarding loyalty and praise, so Musk and Tesla may be unconventional Trump winners.\n\nGEO Group Inc. (GEO)\n\nGEO is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in private prisons. The company's ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) processing centers and USMS (U.S. Marshals Service) detention centers could get a major bump from Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including potentially detaining undocumented immigrants already inside the U.S.\n\nPrivate prison stocks got a huge boost when Trump was first elected back in 2016. In fact, GEO's stock jumped 21% the day after the election. GEO's stock has almost tripled in the past year, suggesting investors are once again optimistic about a Trump presidency.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)\n\nExxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil major. During his first term in office and throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump has been a strong advocate for domestic U.S. oil and gas production. He often uses the slogan \"drill, baby, drill\" as a rallying cry for the U.S. oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change and pledged to support the oil and gas industry. Trump even chose former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state during his first term.\n\nIntel Corp. (INTC)\n\nIntel is the largest U.S. producer of microprocessors, central processing units for personal computers and many other semiconductor products. At this point, Intel needs all the help it can get in its attempt to turn around its struggling business. President Joe Biden made headlines for his CHIPS Act, which provides subsidies for companies building foundries in the U.S. Alternatively, Trump plans to implement tariffs on imported chips, primarily from Taiwan. Intel is already building domestic foundries, and tariffs on imported chips could reduce its international competition. Intel shares also jumped in January on rumors of a potential buyout.\n\nWells Fargo & Co. (WFC)\n\nWells Fargo is one of the largest U.S. banks, lending mostly within the U.S. market. During Trump's first administration, he treated the banking industry well by supporting deregulation. That hands-off approach is good news to the entire U.S. banking industry, but it may be particularly good news for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo was one of the largest corporate donors to the Trump campaign. The bank is likely interested in Trump pushing to remove Wells Fargo's punitive $1.9 trillion Federal Reserve asset cap that has been in place since 2018 and has limited the bank's growth opportunities.\n\nFederal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)",

Dallas-based Lincoln Property Co. acquired the six-building complex in 2017, two years after Exxon moved out, when it had the highest office vacancy rate in the city.\n\nLincoln Property Co. pumped $80M into renovating the office complex. It is now inviting bids to start at $7 per SF, The Real Deal reported. CityNorth 1, a 12-story, 254K SF building at 233 Benmar Drive, has a $1.85M starting bid, according to the listing.\n\nCityNorth 6, a 14-story, 356K SF building at 12450 Greenspoint Drive, has a starting bid of $2.4M, the listing shows.\n\nThe online auctions for both buildings are slated for Feb. 10 through Feb. 12, though this is not the first time the buildings have been listed for sale.\n\nLincoln Property Co. put CityNorth 1 on the market in April 2021 with an asking price of $25.4M, according to the Houston Business Journal.

The municipalities are seeking billions of dollars from oil companies, including Exxon, for damages related to flooding and other impacts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelation was included in a 49-page brief filed by an attorney for Amit Forlit, an Israeli citizen who was arrested in April at Heathrow airport for his role in the alleged hacking scheme. The brief, which opposes U.S. efforts to extradite Forlit from the United Kingdom, said the hacking \u201cis alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing Exxon Mobil, one of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel companies.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government is seeking Forlit\u2019s extradition as part of its investigation into a worldwide hacking ring that operated from 2012 to 2019. The government refers in court documents only to a \u201cD.C. lobbying firm\u201d that acted \u201con behalf of one of the world\u2019s largest oil and gas corporations, centered in Irving, Texas.\u201d\n\nEfforts to extradite Forlit come about a year after his alleged associate, Israeli private eye Aviram Azari, was sentenced to nearly seven years in federal prison for his role in a hacking operation that targeted climate activists and others. Court records allege that Azari received a hacking target list from Forlit, who received it from a \u201cDC lobbying firm.\u201d\n\nDocuments stolen by Azari and his ring of hackers were cited by Exxon in court as the company battled an array of climate lawsuits that cities, counties and states filed against the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment for this story.\n\nSome climate activists whose email and social media accounts were infiltrated by the team of India-based hackers that worked at Azari\u2019s direction said they were surprised to hear that Exxon and DCI were named in court records.\n\n\u201cPerpetrators are rarely caught in hacking cases, so we feel fortunate that people are being held to account for these crimes apparently committed on behalf of Exxon by surrogates all the way from Washington to Israel to India and back,\u201d said Kert Davies, who was director of the Climate Investigations Center at the time of the hacking and is now at the Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate litigation against energy companies.\n\nDCI officials have said no one at the company has ever been questioned about the case. Craig Stevens, a partner at the company, said in an email to POLITICO\u2019s E&E News that \u201callegations of DCI\u2019s involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false.\u201d\n\nHe added that all DCI employees and consultants are directed to comply with the law.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nAn Exxon spokesperson said the company was not involved in or aware of any hacking activities.\n\n\u201cIf there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nForlit is fighting extradition to the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including an allegation that he\u2019s being prosecuted to \u201cadvance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.\u201d\n\nHis attorney, Rachel Scott, argued that his prosecution is \u201cbut one piece within a complex matrix of ongoing litigation on climate issues in the United States, which can only sensibly be seen as politically motivated.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government, which is not involved in the climate lawsuits against the oil and gas companies, dismissed the argument that the charges against Forlit are politically motivated, writing in its own brief that he faces prosecution \u201cfor straight-forward criminal allegations that he orchestrated the hacking of persons for money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there may be a wider political context (as there are with many offences) does not begin to establish the bar\u201d to prevent extradition, states the brief. It also notes that Forlit is accused of being involved in plans to steal information related to \u201cArgentinian debt relief.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that investigators were looking into whether Forlit oversaw the theft of emails from Argentine government officials while working on behalf of a hedge fund that sued the country.\n\nReuters reported on the climate hacking allegations last year, prompting then-Senate Budget Chair Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) to urge the Department of Justice to \u201ctake a good, long look at Exxon and its fellow fossil fuel flunkies.\u201d\n\nThe court documents filed by Forlit last week said a New York grand jury in November 2022 returned an indictment charging Forlit with conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of five to 20 years.\n\nThe hacking attempts directed at climate activists began soon after a pair of investigative news reports in 2015 revealed that Exxon privately knew about climate change in the 1970s but publicly denied the scientific consensus for decades.\n\nEnvironmentalists were tipped off to the hacking after a reporter called to ask about an email that detailed a private meeting at the Rockefeller Family Fund headquarters in January 2016. The meeting was mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article several months later, and the email was printed a day later in the Washington Free Beacon. Exxon itself later cited the news articles in court documents.",

Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Pending receipt of all required permits and approvals, Kinder Morgan expects the project to be in service in the first quarter of 2027.\n\nThe difficulty in moving gas from Katy eastward is the city of Houston. A direct path would require traversing the fourth-largest city in the US, which, while not impossible, would be daunting due to the complex negotiations required for rights-of-way across various sections of the city.\n\nWhile Kinder Morgan has not disclosed its final pipeline route, it revealed in its open season announcement last fall the counties that would have delivery points\u2014Grimes, San Jacinto, Liberty, Hardin, and Jefferson. This route would extend north beyond the Houston's city limits and the Sam Houston National Forest before turning southeast toward Port Arthur.\n\nElsewhere, Kinder Morgan subsidiary Hiland Partners Holdings agreed to purchase a natural gas gathering and processing system in North Dakota from Outrigger Energy II for $640 million. The acquisition includes a 270 MMcf/D processing facility and a 104-mile, large-diameter, high-pressure rich-gas gathering header pipeline with 350 MMcf/D of capacity connecting supplies from the Williston Basin area to high-demand markets. The gathering and processing system is backed by long-term contracts with commitments from major customers in the basin.\n\nThe transaction is subject to clearance under Hart-Scott-Rodino and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Crude oil prices are expected to slip in 2025, continuing the trend from 2024, which saw prices dragged down by weak Chinese demand and a supply glut. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted global oil demand to grow by under a million barrels per day in 2025, a significant slowdown compared to the two million barrels per day increase in 2023. Commonwealth Bank of Australia expects Brent oil prices to fall to $70 per barrel this year, citing increased oil supply from non-OPEC+ countries that will likely outpace the rise in global oil consumption. BMI noted that the first half of 2025 is likely to see a supply glut as substantial new production from the U.S., Canada, Guyana, and Brazil comes online. If OPEC+ plans to roll back voluntary cuts materialize, the oversupply will further pressure prices.\n\nGlobal natural gas prices have rallied since mid-December 2024, driven by cold weather and geopolitical tensions. Ukraine\u2019s recent halt of Russian gas flow to several European nations on New Year\u2019s Day has introduced greater uncertainty to the global gas markets. As long as the cutoff remains in place, gas prices are likely to remain elevated. BMI forecasts gas prices to rise by about 40% in 2025 to $3.4 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), driven by growing demand from the LNG sector and higher net pipeline exports. LNG will continue to drive new consumption, supported by rising export capacity and strong demand in Europe and Asia, according to BMI analysts.\n\nGold prices, which notched a series of all-time highs in 2024, are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2025. Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault, a gold investment services firm, attributes this optimism to investors\u2019 pessimism about geopolitics and government debt. Gold\u2019s role as a hedge against risk and inflation makes it an attractive asset in uncertain times. JPMorgan analysts also forecast a rise in gold prices, particularly if U.S. policies become more disruptive, leading to increased tariffs, elevated trade tensions, and higher risks to economic growth. Gold prices, which rose about 26% in 2024, are forecast to reach $3,000 per ounce in 2025.\n\nAccording to Sabrin Chowdhury, the head of commodities analysis at BMI, commodities in general will face pressure across the board in 2025. The strength of the U.S. dollar is expected to cap demand for commodities priced in the greenback, making them more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by a sluggish global economic outlook, which will dampen demand for raw materials and energy resources.\n\nThe year 2025 is shaping up to be a mixed bag for commodity markets. While global commodity prices are largely expected to fall due to a sluggish economic outlook and a resurgent U.S. dollar, certain commodities such as gold and gas are poised for a rally. Industry experts and market participants are closely monitoring these trends, particularly in the context of China\u2019s economic policies and global geopolitical developments.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ) stands against other best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSilver is expected to see price increases in 2025, driven by strong industrial demand. Silver is used in a variety of applications, including solar panels, automobiles, jewelry, and electronics. The demand for solar power, in particular, is expected to remain resilient, and the metal\u2019s supply is limited.\n\nCopper, a key material in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and power grids, may see a dent in prices in 2025. The metal reached a record high in May 2024, largely due to a squeezed market and the global energy transition. However, a potential deceleration in the energy transition, driven by policy shifts, might dampen the \u201cgreen sentiment\u201d that bolstered prices in 2024. John Gross, president of John Gross and Company, a metals management consultancy, expects copper prices to trend lower in 2025 due to a cocktail mix of high interest rates, elevated interest rates, and a stronger dollar, which will weigh on all metals markets.\n\nIron ore prices are forecast to drop in 2025, driven by an oversupply resulting from Chinese policies and geopolitical factors. Goldman Sachs expects prices to decline to $95 per ton in 2025, citing the expected U.S. tariffs on China, the changing nature of Chinese stimulus, and the introduction of new low-cost supply. Despite China likely importing a record amount of iron ore this year, the market is expected to move into a surplus, leading to a decline in prices.\n\nThe global commodity markets in 2025 are expected to be characterized by a mix of trends, with some commodities facing headwinds while others continue to rally. However, commodities are a solid investment option due to their inherent scarcity and long-term value as demand continues to grow.\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Among the Best Commodity Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA refinery, the sun illuminating its engineering complexity.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best commodity stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used commodities ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies that are involved in mining, trading or processing of commodities.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. These selections are derived from sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, given their historical resilience and stability even during economic downturns. A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market.

This company presents a solid investment opportunity, supported by the following points. Firstly, the company\u2019s ability to generate profits is evident in the report for the third quarter of 2024. For instance, improved earnings power from an enterprise-wide transformation drove industry-leading net income of $8.6 billion. Additionally, the company returned $9.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter and increased its fourth-quarter dividend to $0.99 per share, which demonstrates the company\u2019s strong financial position and its focus on providing higher returns to investors by increasing regular dividend payouts. Moreover, the company has expanded oil production offshore in Guyana with a new multi-billion-dollar Hammerhead project, which would increase production capacity and strengthen the company\u2019s presence in the Guyanese oil sector.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 8th on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil and its Permian-focused operations remained atop Enverus' rankings of the 50 most prolific public oil and gas operators. Courtesy ExxonMobil\n\nEnverus has released its annual list of the most prolific 50 public oil and gas operators, based on gross operated production last year. Enverus analysts found the wave of consolidation that swept the upstream sector last year \u2014 with highlights including ExxonMobil acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources, Diamondback Energy acquiring Endeavor Energy Resources and Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern combining into the newly formed Expand Energy.\n\nManuj Nikhanj, Enverus chief executive officer, noted that in 2024 the top 10 public operators represented 56% of production out of the Top 50 on a barrel of oil equivalent per day basis. That figure jumped to 62% due to the consolidations.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIt is also clear, Nikhanj said, that the Permian remains king amid the nation\u2019s producing basins.\n\n\u201cThe Permian is still the king, and the most active region operated by the top 50 operators. Seven of the top 10 have the Permian as their most active region. Volume-wise, the Permian also dominates the rankings \u2014 81% of oil production and 40% of gas production from the top 50 names comes from this one basin,\u201d he said.\n\nTopping the list was Permian-focused ExxonMobil with 1.96 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Midland-based Diamondback Energy ranked ninth on the list, up four spots from 2023, with 898,156 BOE per day. Permian Resources, also Midland-based, rose two spots to 13 with 439,435 BOE per day. The biggest change in rank was seen by Permian-focused Empire Petroleum, with leaped 13 places to 50 with 3,320 BOE per day.\n\nNikhanj explained the significance of the annual listing: \u201cA snapshot of rig counts provide some color on operator sentiment, too. The Top 50 names were running a total of 298 rigs at the time of list compilation, compared to 322 from the prior year at a similar point in time. Notwithstanding the pull back, the approximately 10% increase in rig efficiency over this period is driving production growth, even at lower activity levels.\u201d",

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis oil and natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -36.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $87.12 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.77% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

Both the lobbying firm and ExxonMobil have denied any awareness of or involvement with alleged hacking.\n\nThe hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm, according to a lawyer representing the U.S. government. The firm, in turn, was allegedly working on behalf of one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not name either company.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAs part of its probe, the U.S. is trying to extradite an Israeli private investigator named Amit Forlit from the United Kingdom for allegedly orchestrating the hacking campaign. A lawyer for Forlit claimed in a court filing that the hacking operation her client is accused of leading \"is alleged to have been commissioned by DCI Group, a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest fossil fuel companies.\"\n\nForlit has previously denied ordering or paying for hacking.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the U.S. probe who was not authorized to speak publicly, the U.S. has investigated DCI's possible role in the hacking. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the U.S. government has investigated DCI.\n\nDCI lobbied for ExxonMobil for about a decade, according to federal lobbying records. NPR has not been able to confirm what, if any, links the Justice Department may have thought DCI had with the hacking campaign. NPR has not found any indications that the Justice Department has investigated ExxonMobil in relation to this case.\n\nDCI and ExxonMobil declined to comment on the allegations made in the London hearing. Both companies referred NPR back to statements they had provided earlier in our investigation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nCraig Stevens, a partner at DCI, said in an email that no one at the firm has been questioned by the U.S. government as part of the hacking investigation. \"Allegations of DCI's involvement with hacking supposedly occurring nearly a decade ago are false and unsubstantiated. We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law,\" Stevens said. \"Meanwhile, radical anti-oil activists and their donors are peddling conspiracy theories to distract from their own anti-U.S. energy activities.\"\n\nExxonMobil spokesperson Elise Otten said in an emailed statement that the company \"has not been involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities. If there was any hacking involved, we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nIn a court document arguing for Forlit's extradition, the lawyer for the U.S. government described a sophisticated hacking operation that spanned continents. Forlit ran security companies that gathered information using various methods, including hiring \"co-conspirators to hack into email accounts and devices,\" according to the court filing.\n\nA lawyer representing the U.S. government revealed in the court filing that Forlit has been indicted in the U.S. on charges of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud, according to the court filing in London.\n\nClimate activists who were targeted by hackers say the plot that U.S. officials have been trying to unravel was aimed at disrupting their efforts to fight climate change by pushing governments and society to slash the use of fossil fuels like oil and coal.\n\n\"It was undoubtedly designed to intimidate and scare advocates from continuing their work to hold these major oil companies accountable for the decades of deception that they're responsible for,\" says Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund and one of the hacking victims.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe fossil fuel industry faces dozens of lawsuits filed by states and localities accusing companies of misleading the public about the risks of climate change. The industry says that those lawsuits are meritless and politicized and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.\n\nThe potential impact on civil society of hacking-for-hire operations is grave, according to cybersecurity and legal experts.\n\n\"Nothing is more powerful at chilling speech and encouraging self-censorship than the feeling that your entire digital world, which probably touches your whole world, could be invaded by people who mean you harm simply because of what you're doing at work,\" says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, a cyber watchdog at the University of Toronto that analyzed the attacks. \"Simply because you're concerned about rising sea levels.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has said previously that ExxonMobil took advantage of leaked information\n\nThe U.S. hacking investigation became public in 2019 with the arrest in New York of a business associate of Forlit's named Aviram Azari. A former Israeli police officer and private investigator, Azari eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer hacking, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe hackers Azari hired didn't target just American climate activists, according to federal prosecutors. They also attacked government officials in Africa, members of a Mexican political party and critics of a German company called Wirecard.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Koeltl sentenced Azari in November 2023 to more than six years in prison and ordered him to forfeit more than $4.8 million that prosecutors allege he was paid for managing the hacking campaigns.\n\nAt Azari's sentencing, federal prosecutors did not say who they believed had hired Azari to target the climate activists. The Justice Department stated in a sentencing memo that ExxonMobil was the beneficiary of the information that the attacks revealed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFederal prosecutors asserted in the Azari sentencing memo that information stolen from climate activists was leaked to the media, resulting in news stories that \"appeared designed to undermine\" state climate investigations of ExxonMobil. The company's lawyers used the news stories in court as part of their defense against the state investigations, prosecutors said.\n\nExxonMobil said in a statement at the time that it had done nothing wrong. \"ExxonMobil has no knowledge of Azari nor have we been involved in any hacking activities,\" the company said.\n\nThe sentencing memo in Azari's case noted a private email among climate activists that surfaced in the media in 2016. The email described plans for a closed-door meeting in New York among leading climate activists, including writer and organizer Bill McKibben and Peter Frumhoff, then the chief climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog and research group. The meeting's goal, according to the email, was to sharpen attacks on ExxonMobil and convince the public that the company is a \"corrupt institution\" that pushed the world toward \"climate chaos and grave harm.\" It also raised the prospect of legal action through state attorneys general and the Justice Department.\n\nExxonMobil and some Republican lawmakers cited the document as they tried to fight off state climate investigations, saying activists and prosecutors colluded to advance a political agenda.\n\ntoggle caption Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLawyer for U.S. government described a sophisticated hacking campaign\n\nAzari was sent to a federal prison in New Jersey in 2023. Five months later, Forlit was arrested in London. The Justice Department has been working through British lawyers to have Forlit extradited to the U.S. to face criminal prosecution \"arising from a 'hacking-for-hire' scheme,\" court documents show.\n\nOne of Forlit's clients from 2013 to 2018 was an unnamed \"D.C. Lobbying Firm,\" the court filing says. That firm \"acted on behalf of one of the world's largest oil and gas corporations, centred in Irving, Texas,\" the document says. The company, in particular, wanted to discredit people and organizations engaged in climate change litigation against it, a lawyer for the U.S. wrote. Until mid-2023, ExxonMobil was headquartered in Irving, Texas.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA lawyer representing the U.S. alleged that the lobbying firm gave Forlit targets to hack. The lawyer said there's a \"strong circumstantial case\" that Forlit gave the list of at least 128 targets to Azari, who then hired hackers in India.\n\nForlit and Azari both referred to the operation as \"Fox Hunt,\" the lawyer for the U.S. said in the London court filing. The hacking obtained \"non-public documents which were provided to the oil and gas company and published as part of a media campaign to undermine the integrity of civil investigations,\" according to the filing.\n\n\n\nD.C.-based firm lobbied for ExxonMobil for about a decade\n\nDCI, the public affairs firm that Forlit's lawyer said her client allegedly worked for, has a long history working for the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe firm worked for a nonprofit that supports the U.S. coal industry. And one of DCI's executives was identified as a spokesman for a group that backed the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline.\n\nIn the early 2000s, ExxonMobil provided funding for a website DCI published called Tech Central Station, which the Union of Concerned Scientists called a \"hybrid of quasi-journalism and lobbying.\" And from 2005 until early 2016, ExxonMobil paid DCI around $3 million to lobby the federal government, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\nThe lawyer for the U.S. government said in an extradition statement that the hacking operation started in late 2015. At that time, the oil and gas industry was facing a mounting backlash. Stories by investigative journalists in 2015 revealed that ExxonMobil's own scientists warned top executives about dire risks from climate change as early as the 1970s. Despite those warnings, the oil company went on to lead a decades-long campaign to sow public confusion about global warming. Activists seized on the reports, popularizing the hashtag #ExxonKnew to argue that ExxonMobil knew about human-caused climate change despite denying it publicly.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Democrats urged the Justice Department to investigate whether ExxonMobil misled the public about climate change. And a group of state attorneys general banded together to find \"creative ways to enforce laws being flouted by the fossil fuel industry and their allies,\" New York's attorney general said in early 2016.\n\nSince then, dozens of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. against ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations, largely by Democratic-led states and towns. They allege the industry misled the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. The lawsuits seek damages to help communities cope with climate risks and damages.\n\n\n\nVictims say finding out who ordered the hacking is crucial\n\nForlit's lawyer, Rachel Scott, focused on the litigation against ExxonMobil in her opening arguments in London. She said the U.S. is trying to prosecute Forlit in part \"to advance the politically-motivated cause of pursuing ExxonMobil.\"\n\nThe U.S. government is not part of the climate lawsuits filed by states and localities.\n\nIt has been years since the climate activists were targeted by hackers, but finding out who directed and paid for the operation is still vital, says Matt Pawa, an environmental lawyer who was targeted in the hacking.\n\nIt's important \"for the purposes of deterrence,\" Pawa says, \"so that this is not done again.\"",

Forlit has previously denied being involved in hack-for-hire work.\n\nExxon said the oil company \u201chas not been involved in, nor are we aware of, any hacking activities\u201d and that, if there were hacking involved, \u201cwe condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\u201d DCI Group said the allegations that it commissioned the hacking operation were false, adding that it directs all of its employees and consultants to comply with the law.

            "content": "Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter.\n\nEli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp., as well a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc.The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.

LLY, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST and Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. BDL.\n\nStory Continues\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\nCostco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+43.3% vs. +23.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.\n\n\n\nThese factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\n\n\n\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Costco here >>>)\n\nShares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model.\n\n\n\nGeographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Flanigan's here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Exxon has four LNG projects under development and expects to start commissioning the production units in the US and Qatar first, by the end of this year. Other US export projects will also start ramping up production but the bulk of new supply won\u2019t arrive until 2027.\n\n\u201cThe problem is you don\u2019t find gas from one day to the next,\u201d ExxonMobil Europe president Philippe Ducom, told Bloomberg at the site of the Handelsblatt energy conference in Berlin, \u201cSignificant new LNG capacity is only coming on stream in 2026-2027.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump, whose country is the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporter, has threatened Europeans with tariffs if they don\u2019t buy more oil and gas. As soon as he took office this month, Trump also lifted a freeze on new LNG export permits that his predecessor Joe Biden had introduced, but these projects are not expected to go online before 2031.\n\nDucom said that Europe had been reluctant to commit to long-term contracts and bring supply security in the equation, which investors need to take the huge financial decisions to start new LNG projects.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clearly having an impact on the cost of energy for Europe because gas impacts power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will need gas for decades to come and in 2050, we will still need gas. But there has been thisreluctance to commit and to try to bring supply security in the equation.\u201d\n\nDucom also said that the European chemical sector, a key industrial user of gas as a feedstock, was in a crisis because demand on the continent isn\u2019t growing and due to high energy and operating costs compared to other regions. \u201cThere is a lot of new capacity coming. Supply capacity is higher than demand. Chemical margins are really thin. Europe is probably the least competitive region in terms of chemical production right now.\u201d\n\nMany European industrial companies have had to slash output, close factories or relocate their production facilities outside Europe since the energy crisis of 2022 pushed up regional energy prices.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "\u201cIslamic finance as a sector is barely 30 years old, with the past 15 years seeing the most development. It takes time to educate and create awareness and as this has happened, more banks have focused on servicing the demand for halal investing. This in turn helps to create more products, which then creates more demand.\u201d\n\nHalal investing is still a relatively new concept in the US, where Muslims make up around 1% of the population, as of 2020. In the past, older generations of Muslims typically focused on real estate and physical gold as investments or chose stocks recommended by friends and community members. The complexities of Islamic finance have led many to overlook it. However, this is beginning to change as technology advances and demographic trends shift. Financial educators, along with fintech startups, halal stockpickers, and specialized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are helping fill the gap. In addition, the rise of zero-fee brokerages has made investing more accessible to Muslims who follow strict financial guidelines. These low-cost platforms have made it easier to serve clients who were previously overlooked or considered unprofitable. Omar Shaikh, director of Islamic Finance Council UK, made the following comment about this:\n\nWhen investing in halal stocks, it's important for investors to carefully consider a company's balance sheet. Companies with debt exceeding 33% of their market value are disqualified from halal investing, though this ratio can fluctuate for some businesses. According to a World Bank report, the Islamic finance industry has grown quickly in the last decade, with an annual growth rate of 10-12%. Currently, Sharia-compliant financial assets are valued at approximately $2 trillion, encompassing both bank and non-bank institutions, as well as capital markets, money markets, and insurance.\n\nHalal stocks are shares in companies that adhere to Shariah law. These companies operate in accordance with Islamic principles, avoiding industries such as alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. They also maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their revenue sources are consistent with Islamic values. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah index tracks the performance of Shariah-compliant companies from the Composite 1500 that have a history of consistently raising their dividends for at least 20 years. These companies follow a managed dividend strategy, ensuring steady growth in dividend payouts.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Halal Dividend Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other halal dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHalal investing is experiencing growth despite limited awareness. A 2023 report by the General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions revealed that the global Islamic funds market has expanded by over 300% in the past decade, with nearly $200 billion in assets now managed worldwide. A Goldman Sachs report from December 2022 projected that by 2075, five of the world's ten largest economies\u2014India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Egypt\u2014will have Muslim populations exceeding 850 million people.\n\nAs the Muslim population grows, so does the demand for financial products tailored to their needs. According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2023 by DinarStandard, approximately $25.9 billion was invested in Sharia-compliant investments during the 2022-23 financial year, reflecting a 128% increase from the previous year.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we chose the top 10 stocks from the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index. These specific companies are known for consistently providing substantial dividends to their shareholders and demonstrating robust financial stability. We ranked these holdings based on the number of hedge funds that had invested in them by the end of Q3 2024, using data from Insider Monkey's database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

In the past year, the stock has surged by over 13% and also reported strong earnings in the third quarter. The company reported $90.02 billion in revenue, surpassing analysts' expectations by $1.66 billion. It delivered strong financial performance, generating $17.6 billion in operating cash flow and $11.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter. In addition, the company returned $9.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. This robust cash flow allowed Exxon to increase its payouts for the 42nd consecutive year.\n\nThough Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) remains a major player in the global fossil fuel industry, it is also ramping up its investments in lower-carbon energy. The company recently shared its 2030 vision, which aims to allocate up to $30 billion towards low-emission projects between 2025 and 2030. Exxon has also secured the largest offshore carbon dioxide storage site in the U.S. through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. Furthermore, the company is working on developing the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility, which would have the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen daily.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share, having raised it by 4% in November 2024. As of January 22, the stock supports a dividend yield of 3.62%.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 indicated that 86 hedge funds owned stakes in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared with 92 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $7 billion. First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company\u2019s leading stakeholders.\n\nOverall XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best halal stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "ExxonMobil is also developing green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies. (Photo: iStock)\n\nUpon taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump immediately announced the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, rejecting the obligations set by the United Nations for carbon reduction.\n\nHowever, some oil and gas industry leaders have expressed concerns that this move does not help their push for clean energy investments, highlighting the misalignment between policy and industrial development during the energy transition.\n\nOil firms: Trump\u2019s exit risks unbalanced regulatory environment\n\nAccording to Reuters, multiple industry representatives voiced concerns, with major oil companies believing that Trump's exit from the international climate agreement would only reduce the U.S.'s influence in the global energy transition, placing businesses in an unbalanced regulatory environment.\n\nMarty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, stated that energy companies under the organization hoped Trump would keep the U.S. in the agreement. He emphasized that while developing necessary solutions, businesses are also striving to address climate challenges in response to the growing global demand for energy.\n\nSimilarly, companies involved in oil and gas exploration echoed this sentiment. Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC), argued that U.S. participation in global climate discussions is crucial, noting that \"any conversation about addressing climate change must be global, and also recognize that America is the world leader in both energy production and emissions reductions.\"\n\nExxonMobil warned about policy uncertainty\n\nAmid the global energy transition, many large oil and gas developers, including ExxonMobil, have started investing in green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies. ExxonMobil secured a $331 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for carbon reduction projects and has partnered with French company Air Liquide to build the largest low-carbon hydrogen facility in Texas.\n\nBefore this, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods had warned Trump at the UN Climate Summit (COP29) about the risks of another U.S. withdrawal from the climate agreement, fearing that policy reversals could create significant uncertainty.\n\nWynne Lawrence, a climate risk expert at Clyde & Co law firm, believes the U.S. exit would make regulations opaquer and more complex, complicating the ability of companies to navigate multinational corporate transformations and supply chain shifts, potentially leading to legal disputes.\n\nExxonMobil partners with French company Air Liquide to build the largest low-carbon hydrogen facility in Texas. (Photo: Air Liquide)\n\nWind energy sector faces setbacks\n\nOn the other hand, Trump's executive order to suspend leasing federal lands for wind farms has had a severe impact on related stock prices, with Danish wind giant \u00d8rsted's shares plunging 17% on January 21. Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at Sydney Bank, pointed out that \u00d8rsted\u2019s seabed leases issues in the U.S. might be linked to Trump's administration. If leasing progress is blocked, the company's assets could lose significant value.\n\nItalian cable manufacturer Prysmian also announced on the same day that it would abandon plans to build a factory in the U.S., causing its stock price to drop by 1%. Prysmian is one of the world\u2019s top cable manufacturers and has completed the only two underwater cable projects deeper than 2,000 meters.\n\nThe wind energy sector has been facing challenges over the past two years due to soaring costs, interest rate hikes, and supply chain issues, forcing many wind development projects to be delayed or canceled. With Trump back in the White House, the U.S. wind energy industry could see further difficulties.\n\nSource: Reuters(1), (2), (3), Utility Dive",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nA state judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by New York City seeking to hold Big Oil accountable for alleged greenwashing practices and its role in exacerbating climate change, per a ruling issued last week.\n\nState Supreme Court Justice Anar Patel wrote in her Jan. 14 decision New York City had failed to demonstrate that the defendants named in its suit \u2014 ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and the American Petroleum Institute \u2014 had deceived consumers about the climate impact of their fossil fuel products.\n\nPatel\u2019s dismissal stated that the city could not claim New Yorkers were \u201cclimate conscious\u201d and sensitive to the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but were \u201cmisled\u201d by oil and gas companies\u2019 failure to disclose how their fossil fuel products contributed to it.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe state judge said that as the city has previously alleged \u201cthere is near universal consensus that global warming is primarily caused, or at least accelerated, by the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d it cannot \u2014 at the same time \u2014 say its consumers were \u201cduped\u201d by oil and gas companies\u2019 failure to disclose that \u201ctheir fossil fuel products \u2026 contribute to climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe City cannot have it both ways,\u201d Patel wrote in her ruling.\n\nThe state judge\u2019s ruling also said the city had not \u201csufficiently pled\u201d how Big Oil misled consumers with marketing campaigns by showing support for clean energy and alternative energy sources, and called the alleged greenwashing statements \u201cinactionable.\u201d Patel added some of the alleged greenwashing statements highlighted by New York City were \u201cdistortions\u201d of original statements or had been taken out of context.\n\nPatel also argued that some of the alleged greenwashing statements did not fall under the state\u2019s consumer protection statutes as they consisted of language that was aspirational, opinionated or exaggerated.\n\n\u201cNo reasonable consumer would be misled by these subjective, nonspecific, and vague statements,\u201d Patel wrote.\n\nThe New York City Law Department told ESG Dive it was disappointed with last week\u2019s ruling and was reviewing its legal options.\n\n\u201cOur complaint alleged that these defendants spent millions to mislead consumers to think that they, and their products, contribute to a clean energy future. They do not,\u201d a spokesperson for the law department said in an emailed statement Wednesday. \u201cCompanies that violate the city\u2019s consumer protection laws should be held fully accountable. New Yorkers deserve no less.\u201d\n\nThe city filed the suit in a state court in April 2021, shortly after a federal appeals court rejected its bid to hold five oil and gas companies \u2014 Exxon, Shell, BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips \u2014 accountable for causing climate-linked damages, such as global warming.\n\nNew York\u2019s suit against Big Oil is one of at least 86 climate cases filed against fossil fuel producers since 2015, according to a report from Oil Change International and Zero Carbon Analytics. The report also found that the annual number of climate-related lawsuits filed against the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel producing companies has nearly tripled since the Paris Agreement was adopted a decade ago. Companies facing litigation include Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nThe suit is also one of many initiated by states, cities and municipalities \u2014 from California to Chicago and Honolulu \u2014 looking to hold Big Oil accountable for its role in spurring climate change and related natural disasters.\n\nShell declined to comment on the ruling. ExxonMobil did not provide a comment as of press time.",

The good: Freshly ground single-origin coffee, all from the same richly fertile spot in Central or South America, served piping hot with a bold, rich taste and an underlying nutty flavor with perhaps the subtlest notes of cocoa or caramel, or is that just your imagination?

Check out some of our favorite ways to make quick cash so you can buy that cup of coffee guilt free.\n\nJudging the Coffee at 10 Gas Station Chains\n\nWho has the best gas station coffee? To find out, we sampled the coffee at 10 different gas stations from 10 different national and regional gas station chains.\n\nWe\u2019re judging the coffee by:\n\nPrice. We\u2019re cheap.\n\nThe number of options we have to customize our beverage to our liking.\n\nTaste. This is entirely subjective.\n\nNow, is it fair to judge an entire national gas station chain based on our one personal experience? Well, whoever said life was fair?\n\nWe should note that franchised gas stations are often privately owned, and those owners might invest more or less into their store\u2019s coffee offerings \u2014 so your mileage may vary, so to speak. But a lot of the big national chains can be fairly consistent in how they present themselves to customers, and that includes what kind of coffee they\u2019re serving.\n\nIn any case, we found a huge gulf between the top end of our rankings and the bottom end.\n\nThe 5 Dumbest Things We Keep Spending Too Much Money On You\u2019ve done what you can to cut back your spending.

We mean that literally, because we\u2019re still wide awake days after this big coffee taste-testing tour. *Prices sourced in January 2024.\n\nAmong our findings:\n\nBig Chains, High Prices\n\nThe two biggest national convenience store chains, 7-Eleven and Circle K, charged the most for coffee. The highest price came from 7-Eleven, which charged us $2.29 for a small coffee \u2014 noticeably more than anyplace else.\n\nSmaller Stations Can Be Shaky\n\nWhile some of the larger places had elaborate coffee-dispensing setups, your average gas station with a little store attached might be relying on a single pot of coffee \u2014 maybe two pots sitting on burners. The later in the morning it gets, the more likely it is that this coffee has just been sitting there getting old and bad.\n\nSeveral gas stations had no coffee at all! We had to go to more than one Sunoco, Chevron and BP station before we could find a little java.\n\nOne big takeaway is that if you\u2019re getting gas station coffee after noon or maybe even after 11 a.m., make the effort to go to a station with a larger store attached. You\u2019re more likely to find good, fresh-brewed coffee. The alternative tastes terrible, but we\u2019ll get to that.\n\nRegional Chains Rule\n\nWe found our favorite coffee in regional gas station chains. Apparently they\u2019re trying harder. (Also a lot of these stores are bigger.) Since we\u2019re located in Florida, we\u2019re talking about:\n\nSpeedway, which has 4,000 gas stations on the East Coast and in the Midwest and Southwest\n\nWawa, which has 950 stations in the mid-Atlantic and Florida\n\nRaceTrac, which has 550 stations in the Southeast\n\nUnfortunately, our rankings are missing out on proud regional chains like QuikTrip in the Midwest and South; Cumberland Farms in the Northeast; Buc-ee\u2019s in Texas and the South; and Sheetz in and around Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen the GasBuddy app reviewed 2 million gas station coffee ratings in the app, each of those chains was the top-rated brand in several states.\n\nThe Harsh Truth\n\nWorst deal: 7-Eleven was the biggest disappointment. We paid $2.29 for lukewarm coffee.\n\nBest deal: Speedway had the cheapest coffee of all, and it was tasty.\n\nOur Ranking from Worst to First\n\nVideographer Chris Zuppa and I drove around town, following a map we\u2019d made of 10 gas stations from 10 different chains.\n\nIt was surprisingly hard to find coffee sometimes. In the end, it took going to 15 places to try coffee from all 10 chains.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found out about the taste, customization options and cost of gas station coffee, with stations ranked in order from worst to best. We\u2019re giving each a total score of zero to 5 coffee beans, because it\u2019s super scientific that way.\n\nThe highest score for taste is two beans, the highest score for price is one bean, and the highest score for options is two beans, for a maximum total score of five beans.\n\n10. BP\n\nOptions: These all used to be Amoco stations. Remember Amoco? Anyway, our first BP station didn\u2019t have any coffee. We hit a number of other stations until we came across another BP station, and by that time it was after noon. There was a single coffee pot with just enough coffee to fill a Styrofoam cup. The Last Coffee. The coffee was so old it had a learner\u2019s permit. It was so sludgy, I couldn\u2019t even get the powdered creamer to mix into it. Score: Zero coffee beans.\n\nTaste: It was foul. Sorry, BP. Score: Zero coffee beans.\n\nPrice: $1.59 for a small coffee. With BP\u2019s Bean Counter rewards program, you get a stamp for each hot drink you buy, and every eighth drink is free. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Half a coffee bean.\n\n9. Chevron\n\nOptions: Like BP, we had to hit two Chevron stations before we found coffee. Again, there was a single coffee pot featuring coffee that had been there too long. There were big sugar dispensers but no packets of artificial sweeteners. There were a few creamers in those little bitty cups. There were white Styrofoam cups with plastic lids that didn\u2019t fit. Score: Zero coffee beans.\n\nTaste: Let\u2019s put it this way: I tasted it and immediately made a face. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nPrice: According to my receipt, I paid $1.29 for a small coffee, plus some kind of unexplained \u201cnontax\u201d fee of 25 cents, plus 9 cents in sales tax, for a total of $1.63. With Chevron\u2019s ExtraMile rewards program, purchases earn you credit toward free food and drinks. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: One coffee bean.\n\nCan You Survive 10 Days of Budgeting?

Start saving now!\n\n8. Sunoco\n\nOptions: We had to go to three Sunocos to get coffee. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTaste: We finally got a surprisingly good cup of coffee. That\u2019s what it says in my notes, at least. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: All sizes were priced at $1.87. Sunoco appears to have a gas rewards plan but no coffee rewards plan. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Two and a half coffee beans.\n\n7. Exxon\n\n(We considered going to a Mobil station too, but Exxon and Mobil are basically the same company.)\n\nOptions: This was the first gas station we tried. There was a single coffee pot, but it was empty. Luckily, the store\u2019s sole employee (maybe a manager?) popped out from behind the register and brewed a fresh pot for me. It took four to five minutes to brew. At least I wasn\u2019t in a hurry. On the positive side, the guy was super friendly about it. This is another place with only sugar and no sweeteners. Score: One coffee bean.\n\nTaste: It was hot! It was kind of generic-tasting coffee \u2014 New England Coffee brand \u2014 but it was the hottest coffee we had all day. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: $1.49 for a medium coffee. The Exxon Mobil Rewards+ program saves you 2 cents per dollar you spend in the store. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Three coffee beans.\n\n6. 7-Eleven\n\nOptions: So many choices! Coffee was on tap from big urns of vanilla, blueberry and Brazilian coffees, along with a house blend. Lots of creamers and sweeteners on tap, and mini marshmallows! Chocolate topping! Flavored syrups! Oh, the decadence! They also had iced coffee and cold brew coffee on tap. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: The nation\u2019s biggest convenience store chain was our biggest disappointment. After all that buildup, our coffee was lukewarm! Oh, the betrayal! It was like finding out there\u2019s no Santa Claus.\n\nCoffee is tricky, people. Piping hot coffee tastes great, ice cold coffee tastes great, and room temperature coffee tastes like bad memories and regret. Score: One coffee bean. 7-Eleven is ranked this high only because we vaguely recall having had decent coffee there before.\n\nPrice: The prices were $2.29 for small and medium, $2.99 for large and $3.29 for extra large. Not only that, but $2.29 was the highest price we paid all day. Also, the 7Rewards program on 7-Eleven\u2019s app earns you points that you can eventually redeem for free drinks and snacks. Score: Zero coffee beans.\n\nTotal: Three coffee beans.\n\n5. Circle K\n\nOptions: Now we\u2019re getting somewhere. You\u2019re no doubt familiar with Circle K, which is in nearly every state. Ours had coffee brewing machines with big glass hoppers full of coffee beans on top, although we suspect the beans in the glass cases are just for show. In any case, the machines fresh-brew your coffee on command. I had my choice of a house blend, decaf, hazelnut, Colombian and \u201cMachu Picchu,\u201d a single-origin coffee from a particular region of Peru.\n\nThere were flavored syrups. There were four kinds of creamer on tap \u2014 hazelnut, vanilla, half-and-half and whole milk. And they had decadent-sounding cappuccinos like \u201cwhite chocolate caramel,\u201d if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: After sampling lots of small coffees at lots of small gas stations, we were a little burned out, no pun intended. We cheated this time and got a salted caramel toffee cappuccino \u2014 basically hot liquid candy. It\u2019s not what we would get every time, but it was sweet and it did the trick. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: A sign said a small coffee cost $1.89, a medium $1.99, large $2.09 and extra large $2.19. But according to my receipt, I was quietly charged an extra dime \u2014 $2.09 \u2014 for a medium. Hmmm. We\u2019re taking points off for the sneaky price increase. Also, Circle K has a Sip and Save beverage subscription for $5.99 a month that gets you one drink a day. Score: Zero coffee beans.\n\nTotal: Three and a half coffee beans.\n\n4. Shell/Rally\n\nOptions: Shell is the biggest gas station chain in the U.S., so the quality of its coffee is clearly a national priority. Our Shell station was attached to a Rally store, although we\u2019ve seen locations with generic \u201cfood marts\u201d as well.\n\nInside was a big counter just for coffee, with 10 steaming pots of java in flavors ranging from vanilla to \u201cbold.\u201d All the creamers and artificial sweeteners you could want. They also had six of those pre-blended, sugary coffee-and-cream options you push a button for, including English toffee, hazelnut and vanilla latte. They\u2019ve got iced coffee on tap. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: I tried the \u201cbold\u201d blend, a Perks brand coffee. I wish I could tell you that I tasted notes of toffee and burnt sugar or something like that, but my palate just isn\u2019t that keen. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: The prices were $1.59 for a 16-ounce coffee, $1.69 for a 20-ounce and $1.79 for a 24-ounce, with refills costing $1.29. Shell/Rally has a number of rewards programs, including a coffee/fountain drink club card that gets you every ninth drink for free. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Four coffee beans.\n\n3. RaceTrac\n\nOptions: RaceTrac and Speedway, two regional chains, have similar elaborate coffee setups and are virtually tied in our book, except that Speedway was cheaper.\n\nThey had a row of 12 glass hoppers of coffee beans ready to be ground, including regular, Colombian, Guatemalan, hazelnut, dark roast and decaf. They had chilled cream on tap \u2014 half-and-half, French vanilla (apparently all vanilla in gas station coffee is automatically French vanilla), low-cal French vanilla and whole milk. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: RaceTrac\u2019s coffee cups say \u201cCrazy Good Coffee,\u201d and they\u2019re not lying \u2014 not for gas station coffee, anyway. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: $1.79 for a small coffee. The RaceTrac Rewards program allows you to earn points toward eventually scoring free drinks. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Four coffee beans.\n\n2. Speedway\n\nSpeedway\u2019s a big, sprawling chain of gas stations, with 4,000 on the East Coast and in the Midwest and Southwest.\n\nOptions: Our Speedway had basically the same machines as our RaceTrac. It also had a ton of those pre-blended, sugary coffee-and-cream options you push a button to dispense. We\u2019re not too sure about some of these \u2014 caramel macchiato? cinnamon roll cappuccino? It seems like a lot, but hey, if that\u2019s what sells. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: Robust and delightful. Score: One and a half coffee beans.\n\nPrice: We paid $1.19 for a 12-ounce coffee \u2014 the best price we got all day! The other prices were $1.59 for a medium and $1.79 for a large. The Speedy Rewards program allows you to earn points toward eventually scoring free snacks and drinks. Score: One whole coffee bean!\n\nTotal: Four and a half coffee beans.\n\n1. Wawa\n\nWawa has nearly 1,000 locations on the East Coast, in Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. If you don\u2019t live on the East Coast but you\u2019re just visiting, you might consider gassing up at Wawa just for the coffee. (They\u2019re famous for fresh-made hoagies too.)\n\nOptions: They have urns of hot coffee in an abundance of options, including various origins and roast levels \u2014 and that\u2019s just the start. You\u2019re also greeted by a full cold case of dairy products, ranging from fat-free milk to creamers with enticing flavors like Irish cream, hazelnut and fat-free French vanilla. They also have every sweetener possible, including honey and ground cinnamon. You can also order more elaborate coffee drinks at a coffee bar if you want. Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nTaste: The coffee we fixed for ourselves was the best coffee we had all day, mainly due to the maximum customization capability we were given. (In our case, Colombian coffee cut with Irish cream happens to be a fave.) Score: Two coffee beans.\n\nPrice: We paid $1.79 for a small coffee. Also, you get a free drink the first time you scan your Wawa Rewards app at the register. Score: Half a coffee bean.\n\nTotal: Four and a half coffee beans.\n\nIs Your Paycheck Not Going As Far As It Used To? We get it. Everything is more expensive than it used to be, but your paycheck hasn\u2019t kept up. When money is tight, these resources will help nearly everyone.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nWhy do we care so much about gas station coffee? Compare all these prices to Starbucks, where you can easily spend nearly five bucks on a \u201cgrande\u201d or \u201cventi\u201d mocha or macchiato or latte.\n\nFive bucks at a time \u2014 that really adds up, especially if you\u2019re a daily coffee drinker on the go.\n\nOn the other hand: We may be cheap, but life is too short to drink bad coffee.\n\nMike Brassfield ([email protected]) is a senior writer at The Penny Hoarder.

            "content": "Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, during a panel discussion at CERAweek 2023, held at the Hilton Americas and George R. Brown Convention center Tuesday, March 7, 2023 in Houston. Michael Wyke/Houston Chronicle\n\nScott Sheffield, founder and retired chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources, has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn him being banned from serving on ExxonMobil\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Jan. 17 filed its final consent order approving ExxonMobil\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer conditioned on prohibiting Sheffield and nearly all other former Pioneer employees and board members from its board.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nUnder the final consent order, Exxon is prohibited from nominating, designating or appointing Sheffield to the Exxon board or from serving in an advisory capacity in any way to the Exxon board or Exxon\u2019s management. Additionally, the final consent order requires that for a period of five years, Exxon shall not nominate, designate or appoint any Pioneer employee or director, other than certain named individuals, to the Exxon board. In addition, under the final order, Exxon, for a period of 10 years, will agree to certain Clayton Act Section 8 attestation and reporting obligations.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, on Sheffield\u2019s behalf by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, McKool Smith, P.C., and The Law Office of Jason Nash, PLLC.\n\nIn the filing, Sheffield alleges the FTC order was entered by the FTC in violation of the procedural safeguards of the Administrative Procedure Act, the United States Constitution and the FTC\u2019s own organic statute by bringing its enforcement action against an individual under the guise of a consent proceeding with a third party who has no incentive to resist. \"A government agency cannot side-step Mr. Sheffield\u2019s \u2014 or anyone\u2019s \u2014 statutory and constitutional rights by coercing the 'consent' of a third party to enter an order that purports to carry the force of law. Mr. Sheffield\u2019s rights are not so easily brushed aside.\u201d\n\nThe filing also claims: \u201cMr. Sheffield has been personally and concretely injured by the FTC\u2019s Order. Because of the FTC\u2019s Order, Exxon is prohibited from seating Mr. Sheffield or taking advantage of his decades of experience in the Permian Basin in any advisory capacity at all. The Order is substantively and procedurally unlawful, is a prior restraint of Mr. Sheffield\u2019s speech on matters of public concern and violates his constitutional rights. It should be vacated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFollowing a public comment period, the commission voted 3-2 to approve the final order. Dissenting commissioner Melissa Holyoak, joined by commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson, charged the majority \u201cfabricated one of the most ludicrous theories of harm in its merger-enforcement history.\u201d\n\nIn its initial orders last May approving the ExxonMobil-Pioneer merger but banning Sheffield, the FTC alleged Sheffield engaged in collusive activity that could have raised the price of oil and was concerned about potential anticompetitive conduct if he served on the board.\n\nIn his first comments on the ban last June, Sheffield called the allegations a false narrative, mischaracterization of the facts and evidence and a baseless interpretation of the applicable law.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn those comment submitted on his behalf by his attorneys, Sheffield stated, \u201cThis document lays out in detail why the FTC is wrong to imply that I ever engaged in, promoted or even suggested any form of anti-competitive behavior.\u201d",

            "content": "Wednesday, January 22, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), as well a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. (BDL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+18.2% vs. -1.7%). Demand for the company\u2019s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\u2019s key top-line drivers. Its new drugs contributed significantly to top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined ahead of fourth-quarter results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>> ) Shares of Exxon Mobil have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+19.6% vs. +14.5%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while a robust structural savings strengthen resilience. With a lower exposure to debt capital, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth. Yet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with refining profits softening. The refining margin pressure intensifies the reliance on upstream operations which is vulnerable to fluctuating oil and gas prices. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter. (You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+43.3% vs. +23.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, Costco has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of Flanigan's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (-3.1% vs. +6.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $46.45 million is facing risks which include a 16.1% net income decline, inflation-driven margin pressure, flat franchise revenue and geographic concentration. Regulatory challenges, high competition and limited diversification further weigh on prospects. Nonetheless, the package store segment and steady rental income provide stability. Flanigan's achieved 7.9% revenue growth to $188.3 million in fiscal 2024 from $174.4 million in the prior year, driven by a 6.3% rise in restaurant sales and 15.1% growth in package store sales, showcasing a diversified revenue model. Geographic expansion opportunities, resilient operations amid cost pressures, and rising dine-in demand position the company for long-term growth. Operational efficiencies help combat rising costs, while digital transformation and menu innovation could enhance customer experience and loyalty.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won\u2019t rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar\u2019s director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that\u2019s partially because of the relative underperformance that they\u2019ve had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they\u2019re becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\u201d\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management\u2019s confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 18.7%\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks seventh on our list of the best stocks with steady dividends. The American oil and gas company is engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of petroleum products.\n\nThough Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a dominant force in the global fossil fuel industry, it is also increasing its focus on lower-carbon energy investments. The company recently outlined its 2030 vision, which includes targeting up to $30 billion in low-emission projects between 2025 and 2030. Exxon has also secured the largest offshore carbon dioxide storage site in the US through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. In addition, the company is developing what would be the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility, capable of producing up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen daily.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported $90.02 billion in revenues in the third quarter of 2024, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by $1.66 billion. The company also posted strong financial results, generating $17.6 billion in operating cash flow and $11.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter. It also returned $9.8 billion to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. This cash flow enabled the company to grow its payouts for 42 years in a row. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.56%, as of January 20.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 indicated that 86 hedge funds owned stakes in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared with 92 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of nearly $7 billion. First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company\u2019s leading stakeholders.\n\nOverall XOM ranks 7th on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(XOM) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) have each seen their share prices decline 3% in recent days. Stocks of other energy companies, such as Shell (SHEL), are also in the red or flat since Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nThe drop in oil stocks mirrors crude prices, with Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, trading at $79.34 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, at $75.95 a barrel. Both crude oil prices were at or near $80 a barrel prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nTrump\u2019s Energy Policies\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has declared a U.S. energy emergency that allows for faster permitting, and said that the U.S. will likely stop buying crude oil from Venezuela. Trump also quickly rolled back environmental protections and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nConsequently, oil stocks are pulling back. Analysts say Trump\u2019s goal of making America the world\u2019s largest energy producer could swamp the global market with crude oil, depressing prices. At the same time, crude oil prices have retreated on news that Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire agreement, ratcheting down tensions in the Middle East.\n\nXOM stock has gained 18% in the last 12 months.\n\nIs XOM Stock a Buy?\n\nThe stock of Exxon Mobil has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 18 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buy and five Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The average XOM price target of $133.35 implies 20% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on XOM stock\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Geopolitical policy is driving higher prices.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the U.S. hit Russia with strict sanctions, driving up prices. To quote a press release by the U.S. Department of State: \"The United States is imposing sanctions today on more than 200 entities and individuals involved in Russia's energy sector and identifying more than 180 vessels as blocked property. This wide-ranging, robust action will further constrain revenues from Russia's energy resources and degrade [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's ability to fund his illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nAssuming consistent demand, higher oil prices can increase oil companies' profits. But if demand falls due to an economic slowdown, it can erode some benefits of higher profit margins.\n\nAs the two largest U.S. oil and gas companies by market capitalization, ExxonMobil (XOM -0.42%) and Chevron (CVX 0.62%) are natural choices for investors looking for dividend stocks in the oil patch. But that doesn't necessarily mean these two majors will benefit the most from higher oil prices.\n\nConsistency you can count on\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron have geographically diverse global production assets with sizable refining segments and low-carbon ventures. They also have rock-solid balance sheets and decades of dividend increases -- 42 consecutive years for ExxonMobil and 37 years for Chevron.\n\nIn December, ExxonMobil updated its corporate plan, including new cost savings targets, earnings and cash-flow expectations, capital return program goals, and more through 2030. By defining clear objectives over five years, ExxonMobil is holding itself accountable and painting a big picture for long-term investors to look past quarterly results.\n\nSimilarly, Chevron expects to deliver further structural cost savings of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2026 while maintaining a low-cost, high-margin production portfolio.\n\nExxon and Chevron are avoiding overexpansion, which would leave them more vulnerable during a downturn. So investors shouldn't expect either company to aggressively ramp up spending just because oil prices are going up. Rather, the focus is to turn a profit even during periods of mediocre oil prices to support capital expenditures and dividend increases.\n\nIn its latest corporate plan update, ExxonMobil charted a path toward a breakeven level of $30 per barrel Brent (the international benchmark) by 2030. Through 2030, it expects to generate $110 billion in surplus cash at $55 per barrel Brent and $280 billion in surplus cash at $85 per barrel Brent. The key is to leave room for upside potential without betting the farm on oil prices going up.\n\nSince both companies are focused more on production quality than quantity, the bulk of excess profits would probably go toward higher stock buybacks.mChevron sports a slightly higher dividend yield of 4.1% compared to 3.6% for ExxonMobil, but both companies can be excellent passive income sources and foundational energy stocks to buy now.\n\nHigher risk, higher potential reward\n\nThe greatest beneficiaries of higher oil prices are leveraged companies or companies with higher breakeven levels. Higher oil prices have a way of making even low-quality businesses look attractive. However, only the best businesses can do well when the tide goes out during periods of lower oil prices.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY -1.41%), Diamondback Energy (FANG -0.51%), and Devon Energy (DVN -2.76%) aren't bad businesses, but they are pure-play exploration and production (E&P) companies that all made splashy acquisitions in 2024. These acquisitions can help all three companies produce outsize free cash flow when oil prices are high. However, they can also leave balance sheets strained when oil prices are low.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy, and Diamondback Energy have far higher financial debt-to-equity leverage ratios than ExxonMobil and Chevron -- showcasing how the capital structure of these E&Ps is more dependent on debt.\n\nEach E&P pays a dividend, but they aren't nearly as reliable as ExxonMobil and Chevron. Occidental Petroleum slashed its quarterly payout to just $0.01 per share in 2020. Diamondback and Devon have historically paid variable dividends that fluctuate based on the business's underlying performance, making them inconsistent options for investors looking for a predictable passive income stream.\n\nHowever, E&Ps can outperform the majors and the energy sector when oil prices are going up. For example, Devon Energy is up 17.4% year to date at the time of this writing compared to an 8.8% gain for the energy sector.\n\nMaintain a long-term view with the energy sector\n\nBefore investing in the energy sector, it is important to understand how different industries within the sector respond to oil prices and each company's risk/potential reward profile.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron may not boom to the same extent as leveraged E&Ps when prices are rising, but they also have raised their dividends even during brutal industrywide slowdowns. Both provide a good starting point for investors who are new to the sector and are seeking foundational holdings, whereas most E&Ps are riskier but also have higher potential rewards.\n\nIf you're still looking for an E&P to buy now, consider ConocoPhillips (COP -1.60%). It is arguably the highest-quality company in the industry, has a low cost of production, and has a path for dividend growth.\n\nLong-term investors should focus more on the companies that have what it takes to perform well no matter the cycle rather than trying to make a quick buck by betting on the riskiest names during an upswing in oil prices.",

            "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nXOM stock is trading at a 6.64x trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA; the broader industry average is currently 4.19x.\n\nOver the past year, XOM has risen 20%, significantly outpacing the 15.9% jump of industry composite stocks.\n\nXOM fundamentals and strategic investments are strong, but investors might benefit from patience.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation XOM is currently considered expensive on a relative basis, with the stock trading at a 6.64x trailing 12-month Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA), which is a premium compared with the broader industry average of 4.19x. Such a premium valuation often signals strong market confidence in the company\u2019s prospects.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, this elevated price necessitates a thorough assessment of the company\u2019s fundamentals, growth potential and prevailing market conditions to check if it is justified.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Growth Engines: Spotlight on Permian & Guyana\n\nWith a strong focus on strengthening its presence in the Permian \u2013 the most prolific basin in the United States \u2013 ExxonMobil completed the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company on May 3. With 1.4 million net acres of the combined company in the Delaware and Midland basins and an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource, ExxonMobil has greatly transformed its upstream portfolio.\n\nExxonMobil aims to double production in the Permian Basin from current levels to 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/d) by 2030.\n\nSimilar to its operations in the Permian, ExxonMobil boasts a robust project pipeline in offshore Guyana resources. The company is well-positioned to generate significant returns from both Permian and Guyana due to low production costs in these assets.\n\nImportantly, advantaged assets like the Permian Basin, Guyana and liquefied natural gas play a pivotal role in ExxonMobil\u2019s upstream portfolio. By 2030, more than 60% of total upstream production will be derived from these assets, categorized as \"advantaged\" due to their lower cost of supply, higher returns and strategic geographic positioning. For details, read: ExxonMobil Unveils Earnings Growth Strategy Worth $20B Till 2030.\n\nDriving Success: XOM\u2019s Integrated Model & Financial Discipline\n\nDue to its integrated business model, ExxonMobil is well protected when oil prices decline. This is because, apart from exploration and production activities, the company has an extensive footprint in refining and chemical businesses.\n\nDuring uncertain times, ExxonMobil can rely on its robust balance sheet. Compared to the industry\u2019s composite stocks, which have a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 22.36%, ExxonMobil has a much lower ratio at 13.34%. Favorable commodity prices have enabled it to enhance its financial position and repay the debt incurred during the pandemic.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChevron Corporation CVX is another integrated energy giant with a strong balance sheet. Belonging to the same industry, Chevron has a slightly higher debt-to-capitalization ratio of 14.13%. BP plc BP, another major player in the integrated energy space, is also reducing its debt load on higher oil prices and decreased capital spending. BP\u2019s debt-to-capitalization ratio is much higher at 41.82%.\n\nXOM: Surplus Cash Flow & Clean Energy Commitment\n\nThe integrated energy giant plans to generate $165 billion in surplus cash flow over the 2025-2030 period, thanks to disciplined capital allocation and improved earnings power. This surplus cash will support increased shareholder distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, enhancing the company's track record of delivering consistent shareholder value.\n\nMoreover, ExxonMobil\u2019s plans to invest $30 billion in low-carbon solutions from 2025 to 2030 underscore its commitment to sustainability and growth. A key focus is on carbon capture and storage networks and hydrogen facilities, including the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen plant in Baytown, producing near-carbon-free hydrogen. With 65% of investments targeting third-party emission reductions, this strategy aligns with global energy transition goals while leveraging ExxonMobil\u2019s expertise to deliver strong returns.\n\nDo Fundamentals Justify ExxonMobil\u2019s Elevated Valuation?\n\nThe positive developments have led to ExxonMobil\u2019s premium valuations, as investors have high expectations for the company\u2019s future growth and profitability. Consequently, they are willing to pay a premium for the stock, believing it will continue outperforming its peers and the broader market. Over the past year, XOM has risen 20%, significantly outpacing the 15.9% jump of the industry\u2019s composite stocks.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite these promising developments, several uncertainties cloud the stock. While the company highlights its advantaged assets, much of its upstream production remains dependent on fossil fuels, leaving it vulnerable to regulatory challenges and market shifts amid the global energy transition.\n\nAdditionally, with its continued emphasis on oil and gas, ExxonMobil is at risk of heightened scrutiny from environmental groups and stakeholders pushing for cleaner energy solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s plan to invest $140 billion in major projects and Permian Basin development by 2030 could become a financial strain if energy prices fail to meet expectations.\n\nWhile the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) XOM\u2019s robust fundamentals and strategic investments position it as a strong player in the energy space, the current premium valuation, uncertainties surrounding its reliance on fossil fuels, stakeholder pressures and high capital expenditures suggest that investors might benefit from patience. Waiting for a more favorable valuation could reduce risk and enhance long-term returns.

Jan. 17, 2025, capping the latest round of oil industry consolidation.\n\nThe antitrust authority, in a 3-2 decision in both cases, prohibited former executives from serving on boards or advising the companies after it \u201cuncovered troubling evidence of public statements by US oil executives as well as direct private communications between those same executives and high-level OPEC representatives that were aimed at persuading rivals to join them in colluding to cut back oil production, which would increase oil prices for Americans,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement addressing both final approvals.\n\n\u201cThis relief will help ensure that these companies seek to respond to their rivals by competing rather than subordinating their independent decision-making to the goals set by a cartel,\u201d Kahn said.\n\nMerger management\n\nIn the Exxon-Pioneer merger, the FTC prohibited founder and former Pioneer chief executive officer Scott Sheffield from serving on Exxon\u2019s board or from serving in an advisory capacity in any way to the Exxon board or Exxon\u2019s management.\n\nRepublicans on the commission blasted the majority\u2019s decision, saying \u201cthe majority fabricated one of the most ludicrous theories of harm in its merger-enforcement history\u201d in its initial complaint against Sheffield for possible collusion.\n\n\u201cThe complaint butchered both the economics and law of coordinated effects, provided absolutely no reason to believe the law has been violated, and ignored the public interest by using its complaint to obtain a consent agreement that targeted an individual who was not party to the agreement,\u201d said Melissa Holyoak, who dissented on behalf of herself and colleague, Andrew Ferguson.\n\n\u201cTo prove that the Exxon Complaint was not mere transient amnesia, the majority regurgitated its theories of harm a few months later in a complaint that challenged Chevron Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Hess Corporation,\u201d she added.\n\nHolyoak and Ferguson alleged the move was political. \u201cToday\u2019s vote should vacate the [FTC\u2019s previous] order, but instead the majority\u2019s pre-inauguration swan song disregards the public interest. As the new administration replaces the old, the public interest considerations will be more than lip service, and the continuing viability of this order should be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nThe Exxon-Pioneer merger, which marks the operator's largest since buying Mobil decades ago, more than doubles ExxonMobil's Permian basin production (OGJ Online, Nov. 6, 2023). The combined company will produce about 1.3 MMboe/d from the Permian, with 2027 output growing to an estimated 2 MMboe/d.\n\nIn the Chevron-Hess deal, the FTC prohibited Hess chief executive officer John Hess from serving on the Chevron board. But in a change from the initial order, the antitrust agency said Chevron could consult John Hess \u201csolely related to interactions and discussions with (a) Guyanese government officials about Hess\u2019s oil-related and health ministry-related activities in Guyana, and (b) the Salk Institute\u2019s Harnessing Plants Initiative.\u201d\n\nChevron agreed to acquire Hess in October 2023 for $53 billion, further diversifying the energy company\u2019s portfolio by adding the Stabroek block interests offshore Guyana and Bakken acreage to the company\u2019s existing US shale position. The deal increases Chevron\u2019s estimated 5-year production and free cash flow growth rates that the company says will extend into the next decade (OGJ Online, Oct. 23, 2023).",

(The pro-rationing authority is a founding purpose of the RRC: to prevent waste of mineral resources.)\n\nSheffield wrote in his lawsuit that asking for pro-rationing is his First Amendment right and \u201cprotected activities cannot be the basis for a law enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe FTC majority \u201capparently believed [this] would escape legal scrutiny if shrouded in the \u2018Consent Order\u2019 process,\u201d he added.\n\nThe allegations \u201conly make sense if the commission believed it would never have to defend them.\u201d\n\nFerguson, who is the new FTC chairman since President Donald Trump was inaugurated Monday, called the FTC decision a \u201cpay-for-peace racket.\u201d\n\nSheffield wrote to the court, \u201cHaving found no viable legal theory to block the acquisition before the clock ran out on its review, the FTC approached [Exxon Mobil] with a deal it could not refuse.\u201d\n\nThe deal was to win FTC approval of the merger\u2014but denying a board seat to Sheffield, although that had been part of the merger agreement.\n\nThe FTC dealt itself \u201can excuse to malign [him] in a sham complaint and public statements that would never have to be defended before a neutral fact-finder.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nFTC Oks Chevron-Hess Deal, Bans John Hess from Board\n\nSheffield began his energy career in 1976 and became the founding CEO of Pioneer in 1997.\n\nThe suit was filed in U.S. District Court\u2014Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth.\n\nSheffield is represented by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton; McKool Smith; and The Law Office of Jason Nash.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil and one of the world\u2019s largest companies. Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The market for rubber and plastic products has expanded significantly in recent years. According to The Business Research Company, it will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% by 2025. The historical period saw growth due to industrialization and manufacturing expansion, automotive industry expansion, consumer goods production, medical and healthcare sector growth, and packaging industry evolution. The market for rubber and plastic products is also projected to increase significantly during the next years. It will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%.\n\nAccording to a report by MNI, there are 13,675 businesses in the rubber and plastics industry in the United States, and their yearly sales total $553 billion. In 2023, employment increased from 846,729 to 858,177, a 1.35% growth. Public ownership is 9%, compared to 5% in manufacturing, while minority and female ownership rates are 2% and 1%, respectively. Materials are imported at a rate of 19% compared to 11% for manufacturing as a whole, while exports reach 42% of distribution, which is higher than the manufacturing average of 29%. The Midwest has 35% of manufacturers, whereas the South has 31%. This is due to the region\u2019s close proximity to major automotive hubs like Kentucky.\n\nThe dynamics of the industry are reflected in workplace safety and pricing patterns. As per the aforementioned report, the subsector recorded 16 fatalities and 2.9 recordable injury cases per 100 full-time employees in 2023. As the number of enterprises steadily increased to 14,536 in Q2 2024, productivity remained a priority. While import and export price indexes showed stability in December 2024, price trends as shown by the Producer Price Index (PPI) showed a minor decline (-0.1%). By striking a balance between labor demands, safety regulations, and pricing pressures, the industry\u2019s performance and trends highlight its importance to the economy.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a crucial component of the manufacturing industry, the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector produces commodities by processing raw rubber and plastic materials. Rubber Product Manufacturing and Plastics Product Manufacturing are the two primary groups that make up the industry. Since rubber is increasingly being replaced by plastics, the subsector mostly concentrates on single-material goods. First-line supervisors, team assemblers, and machine operators are important jobs in this industry. As of December 2024, the subsector employed about 718,300 people, of whom 545,300 were production and nonsupervisory workers. All employees made an average of $29.68 per hour, with production workers making $25.03. In 2023, the median yearly salary for occupations was $36,140 for hand packers and $67,440 for first-line managers.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Plastics and Rubber Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other best plastics and rubber stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInterestingly, as per the latest report, R&D expenditure in the U.S. plastics and rubber manufacturing sector doubled the national average growth rate in 2024, rising 19.4% to $3.1 billion from $2.6 billion in 2023. After a five-year downturn in which R&D investment fell by 16.2%, this represents a recovery. Driven by improvements in polymer materials, production efficiency, and sustainable product development, this sector currently ranks twelfth in terms of R&D investment increase among all sectors in the U.S.\n\nJordan Fazio, senior director of R&D tax credit at Source Advisors, stated:\n\n\u201cInvestment in R&D is no longer optional but a strategic necessity to stay ahead in the competitive landscape. We\u2019ve seen through working with national and international firms in the plastics and rubber manufacturing sector the increased importance placed on being at the forefront of technology to improve existing services and identify new innovation routes\u201d\n\nOverall, the investors have witnessed financial gains as the global materials industry of the broader market has grown by 4.25% since the beginning of the year and by 6.18% in the past year.\n\n10 Best Plastics and Rubber Stocks to Buy According to Analysts\n\nA refinery, the sun illuminating its engineering complexity.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through online rankings to form an initial list of 20 plastics and rubber stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of at least 15% based on analyst price targets as of January 13. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 13: 18.34%\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is best known as an oil and gas firm, but it is also a large manufacturer of specialty polypropylene, a raw material used in plastics, placing it among the Best Plastics Stocks. Propylene is a chemical created during the oil refining process, making it a natural outgrowth of Exxon\u2019s primary business. When more masks and medical supplies were needed in 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response, the company dramatically increased its output of polypropylene. Although plastics provide some diversification from Exxon\u2019s primary petroleum supplies, the company is nonetheless firmly rooted in the fossil fuel energy system.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is investing more than $200 million in Texas to enhance innovative recycling facilities, bringing annual capacity to 500 million pounds and aiming for 1 billion pounds by 2027. The method reduces waste and promotes a circular economy by turning difficult-to-recycle plastics into raw materials for high-performance products. Exxon Mobil meets the increasing demand in industries like pet food and food-safe packaging by providing advanced recycling services to clients in more than 15 countries.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) recorded one of its strongest third-quarter results in a decade with earnings of $8.6 billion. On a constant margin basis, year-to-date 2024 earnings have doubled from 2019 levels due to cost reductions, including a 24% drop in turnaround costs for Energy Products. Following 42 years of yearly dividend growth, the business announced a 4% dividend increase in 2024. In comparison to the previous year, upstream production increased by 24% to 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Furthermore, the firm advanced hydrogen production and secured the largest offshore CO2 storage site in the United States, showcasing its success in low-carbon solutions.\n\nOn January 13, 2024, Truist lifted the price target for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $119 from $117. Based on minimally lower commodity prices, minimally higher production, flat costs, minimal asset degradation, and minimal to moderate operational efficiencies, Truist projected sequentially higher estimated 2026 earnings and free cash flows. It also notes that it believes commodity prices, particularly those of oil and natural gas, will remain firmer this year than many investors currently anticipate.\n\nAccording to the 18 analysts, the average 12-month price projection for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock is $86.66, showing an 18.34% increase from the company\u2019s current price of $73.26. The range of estimates is between $64 and $102.\n\nPaul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, And Will Wurm\u2019s Beech Hill Partners was the only stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 7,227 shares worth $777,408 as of Q3.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 8th on our list of the best plastics and rubber stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has given the green light for two landmark oil deals in the U.S.: Exxon Mobil\u2019s (XOM) acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron\u2019s (CVX) purchase of Hess (HES). In its statement, the FTC confirmed it had approved consent orders settling the antitrust concerns for both transactions. The news comes amid the FTC\u2019s increased focus on oil and gas deals as the industry sees a spike in M&A activity. On Friday, XOM shares rose by 0.90%, while CVX increased by 1.31%.\n\nFTC Clears Path for Oil Giants with a Twist\n\nAs part of Exxon\u2019s $60 billion merger order, the company is prohibited from nominating or appointing former Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield to its board. Meanwhile, for Chevron\u2019s $53 billion deal with Hess, Hess CEO John Hess will not be allowed to join Chevron\u2019s board. Moreover, these CEOs will also be prohibited from serving an advisory role to Chevron and Exxon\u2019s board or management team.\n\nThe U.S. agencies have earlier accused Sheffield and Hess of conspiring and engaging with competitors about global oil production. Such actions could have increased energy prices, impacting U.S. consumers and businesses.\n\nChevron and Exxon\u2019s Big Moves\n\nWith the acquisition of Hess, Chevron gains a 30% stake in the Stabroek block in Guyana, a valuable asset known for high cash margins, low carbon intensity, and projected production growth for the next decade.\n\nAt the same time, the merger of ExxonMobil and Pioneer forms a unique business with significant growth potential in the Permian Basin. Together, they control over 1.4 million acres in the Delaware and Midland basins, with an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent in resources.\n\nExxon will see quicker returns with more oil production per day. However, Chevron\u2019s acquisition may offer more upside due to the future production growth potential in Guyana.\n\nXOM or CVX: Which U.S. Oil Stock Is Expected to Outperform?\n\nHere, we have used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to compare XOM and CVX and identify the oil stock with the higher upside potential, as per analysts.\n\nAccording to TipRanks consensus, CVX stock holds a Strong Buy rating with 16 Buy and 3 Hold recommendations, The Chevron share price target of $175.56 offers an 8.7% upside from current levels.\n\nIn comparison, XOM stock has a Moderate Buy rating, supported by 13 Buy and 5 Hold recommendations. However, the Exxon Mobil share price target of $133.35 suggests a 19% upside potential, nearly double that of CVX.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Newsroom January 19 03:59\n\nIn a significant move that marks the resumption of its plan to explore and exploit its energy resources in the EEZ, the Republic of Cyprus today issued NAVTEX to begin drilling in Term 5. According to Cyprus NAVTEX 019/25, the drilling vessel VALARIS 9, which is already on site, will drill from today until June 19, in Block 5, at the HELEKTRA target for which there are very optimistic indications from the results of the preceding surveys.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the giant EXXON MOBIL, which, in a joint venture with Qatar Energy, holds the rights to this Plot, decides to start drilling at a time when drilling is being done sparingly \u2013 due to the high costs \u2013 proves that there are indications of the existence of a significant gas deposit.\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus\u2019 program for exploration and exploitation of natural resources within its demarcated EEZ (with Egypt) has provoked reactions from Turkey and the pseudo-state, which aim to freeze all exploration activity and drilling within the Cypriot EEZ. Turkey directly claims even part of the demarcated Cyprus EEZ, while on behalf of the Turkish Cypriots it demands as a condition for any exploration that the consent of the pseudo-state must be obtained, even for areas south of the island.\n\nThe drilling by the US oil giant EXXON MOBIL is obviously a deterrent to further moves by Turkey, but it is not impossible that there could be a Turkish reaction by sending Turkish survey vessels to another area of the Cypriot EEZ, as has happened in the past. The start of the drilling coincides with the dramatic upgrading of the Republic of Cyprus\u2019 relations with the US, including at the military level, which has also angered Ankara, and a few weeks before the UN Secretary General is scheduled to convene a multilateral conference on the Cyprus problem. The two NAVTEX issued impose a no-fly zone for the safety of navigation around the drilling rig and there is a warning that any violation will constitute \u201ca criminal offence under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus and the 1982 International Law of the Sea.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.",

            "content": "A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America\u2019s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil.\n\nAccording to the report, there is \u201csubstantial evidence of a \u2018climate cartel\u2019 of financial institutions\u201d including the \u201cBig Three\u201d asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market.\n\nThis cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of \u201calliances\u201d that included \u201cleft-wing environmental activist\u201d groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both.\n\nThe cartel made Exxon a \u201cfocus company\u201d on its \u201cclimate blacklist,\u201d subjecting Exxon to \u201ca barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns \u2014 more than any other company in the world\u201d \u2014 all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production.\n\nThe Big Three\u2019s support was \u201ccrucial\u201d to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon\u2019s shares. The cartel believed that was enough \u201cclout to change outcomes.\u201d As it turned out, it was.\n\nIn 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn\u2019t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon\u2019s board.\n\nThen it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon \u2014 our nation\u2019s largest and most profitable oil company \u2014 adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America\u2019s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that?\n\nWell, not because the people\u2019s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy \u2014 because it\u2019s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it.\n\nNor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon\u2019s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide.\n\nNor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon\u2019s actual shareholders (the Big Three\u2019s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products.\n\nIt happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people\u2019s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy.\n\nBut what about the Big Three\u2019s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients\u2019 best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ \u2014 of which both BlackRock and State Street were members \u2014 thought that \u201cthe economic and social costs\u201d of Paris Agreement compliance \u201care so high\u201d that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients.\n\nOn the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel\u2019s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of \u201csubstantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior\u201d with the Trump administration about to take office.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, in recent weeks there has been an exodus by major U.S. financial companies from climate activist groups, including BlackRock\u2019s recent withdrawal from NZAM. If you\u2019re wondering how important BlackRock was to this effort, within days, NZAM suspended its operations.\n\nBlackRock now claims its NZAM membership \u201ccaused confusion regarding BlackRock\u2019s practices and subjected [it] to legal inquiries from various public officials\u201d but didn\u2019t really affect how it \u201cmanage[d] [clients\u2019] portfolios.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hard to believe, but the good news is that if it\u2019s true, BlackRock will have plenty of opportunity to prove it \u2014 in the lawsuits it\u2019s up against, in future congressional investigations, and before the Trump administration officials tasked with enforcing antitrust laws and the fiduciary obligations imposed by ERISA.\n\nWill there be a meaningful change in the Big Three\u2019s environmental activism? They each issue updated proxy voting guidance in the spring. BlackRock\u2019s is already out. This year\u2019s guidance will be worth a close read.",

            "content": "In addition to the few tech giants regularly making headlines with their gains, large-cap dividend stocks could also be an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable, significant, and growing stream of income. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the broader US large caps are expected to post an 8% increase in dividend payments in 2025, compared to the 6.4% uptick in 2024, 5.1% gains in 2023, and the 10.8% increase witnessed in 2022.\n\nThat said, the expected upcoming fluctuation isn\u2019t going to be something that the mega corporations haven\u2019t dealt with before. A 2023 report by J. P. Morgan revealed that despite the considerable volatility during the period, large-cap stocks gained around 162% between 2013 and 2023, galvanized primarily by big tech. Another 2023 report by CNBC unveiled that large US companies outperformed other investments between 2003 and 2023, with average returns of 9.3%. However, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as despite the stability and reliability large-cap stocks are known for, investors had to survive drops of 56.8% during the 2007-2009 bear market, 33.9% in 2020, and 25.4% in 2022.\n\nHowever, the tailwinds that propelled the market to new heights are beginning to recede, as the rate of monetary policy easing slows down, long-term interests swing upward, inflation becomes sticky, and the US economy is slowing down. Moreover, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and his much-rumored tariffs could also herald a more volatile period for markets, as they could further fan inflation fears and put pressure on stock prices.\n\n2024 proved to be a big year for large-cap stocks, as the broader US market achieved gains of nearly 25%, piggybacking on a 26% performance the year before. Large-cap stock funds, with the heaviest tilt toward growth stocks, performed the best last year, even as the market\u2019s rally somewhat broadened from the handful of mega tech companies that have led much of the bull market.\n\nCompiled and published by Fortune Magazine, the Fortune 500 is an annual list that ranks the biggest US companies by revenue. In total, the Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ a workforce of 31 million around the globe.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against other best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLarge-cap companies tend to have more robust balance sheets compared to their smaller counterparts, enabling them to navigate through market fluctuations more smoothly while also returning value to their shareholders. Corporations in the US have continuously grown their considerable cash stockpiles since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to the economic resilience we have witnessed recently. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group revealed that as of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, up 12.6% from the same period in 2024 and $1.28 trillion more from their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we referred to the top 50 companies among the Fortune Global Rankings. Then, we picked out 12 US-listed companies with the highest dividend yields as of January 13, 2025, and ranked them by their number of hedge fund investors according to the Insider Monkey database as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nAerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nDividend Yield: 3.72%\n\nMarket Cap: $490.1 billion\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest publicly traded energy providers and chemical manufacturers in the world. The company engages in the exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as the manufacture, trade, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, and petrochemicals. With operations in more than 60 countries around the globe, the oil giant gains a significant competitive edge due to its diversified world-class asset portfolio.\n\nThough it is hands-down one of the leaders of the global fossil fuel sector, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also ramping up its investments in lower-carbon energy. The company recently unveiled its 2030 vision, a significant aspect of which is the pursuit of up to $30 billion of low emissions opportunities in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. The oil major recently secured the largest offshore carbon dioxide storage site in the US through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. Moreover, Exxon is working on what would be the biggest low-carbon hydrogen production facility in the world, with the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day.\n\nIn May 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in a $59.5 billion all-stock deal, the largest deal in the energy sector in the last 8 years. The acquisition, which was a strategic move from the oil giant to bolster its presence in the Permian Basin, has already started to bear fruit as Exxon has used it to offset the effect of the decline in average oil prices during the quarter, registering the first impact of the new asset.\n\nIn Q3 of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) increased its production to 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up 24% YoY. Q3 was Exxon\u2019s first full quarter with Pioneer, which added 770,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of highly advantaged production. The company is also improving the profitability of the barrels it produces and has doubled its unit earnings per oil-equivalent barrel from $5 in 2019 to $10 in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) also reported a strong financial position in Q3 2024, achieving an operating cash flow of $17.6 billion, with its free cash flow at $11.3 billion. The company returned $26.1 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, with plans to repurchase over $19 billion of shares by the end of 2024. Moreover, Exxon has increased its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.99 in November.\n\nWith 86 elite money managers tracked by IM holding a stake in the company at the end of Q3 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is placed among the Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOverall, XOM ranks 4th on our list of best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Its earliest roots lie with Vacuum Oil which got its start in the 1860s. Vacuum Oil\u2019s primary product was kerosene, an important advancement for heating and lighting in rural America. Vacuum Oil was later merged with Standard Oil of New Jersey which was the parent operation of the Standard Oil empire prior to its breakup. Standard Oil of New Jersey would merge with other independent operators over the next few years until settling on the brand Exxon for most of its operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Oil of New York was operating under much the same impetus, merging and growing, until it became known as Mobil. Then, in 1999, the two giants became one with a merger of equals that on paper had Exxon buying Mobil. Now, the combined company operates under the Exxon, Mobil, and Esso brands as an international vertically integrated energy and petrochemical business.\n\nToday, the company explores and produces crude oil and natural gas and their derivative products globally. As of 2022, it was ranked 6th on Forbes\u2019 Fortune 500 list and 12th on the Global 500 list but it has held positions from #1 to #10 over the years. In terms of its operations, it is the world\u2019s second-largest oil refiner and the largest refiner outside of China. In terms of reserves, Exxon Mobil claimed about 18.5 million barrels of oil and oil equivalents at the end of 2021 and was ranked 15th globally.\n\nExxon Mobil operates through three segments that are the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical segments. The Upstream segment explores for and produces oil and oil equivalents and represents roughly 70% of the income. The Downstream segment gathers, receives, stores, transports and refines oil and equivalents and their derivatives. The Downstream segment also markets and delivers fuel products to consumers and businesses. The Chemicals segment produces the full range of petrochemicals including plastics, resins and synthetic rubber.\n\nExxon Mobil is committed to advancing sustainable and carbon-free energy solutions. The company is targeting 2050 for net-zero emissions and its 2030 interim targets are in alignment with the Paris Accord, the EU's Global Methane Pledge, and US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. The company\u2019s plans include investing $15 billion into reducing greenhouse emissions by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "In a win for the fossil fuel industry, a state judge has rejected New York City\u2019s lawsuit seeking to hold oil and gas companies financially accountable for climate change.\n\nNew York City filed its case in 2021 under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio, alleging \u2014 like dozens of similar climate lawsuits nationwide \u2014 that the oil industry intentionally misled the public about the role of fossil fuels in worsening climate change. But in a ruling issued Tuesday, state Supreme Court Justice Anar Patel found that the city had failed to show that Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP deceived New Yorkers about the climate effects of their products.\n\nPatel wrote that the city had also claimed that \u201cthere is near universal consensus that global warming is primarily caused, or at least accelerated, by the burning of fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe city cannot have it both ways,\u201d Patel wrote.\n\nThe New York City Law Department said it was disappointed with the ruling and is reviewing its options.\n\n\u201cOur complaint alleged that these defendants spent millions to mislead consumers to think that they, and their products, contribute to a clean energy future. They do not,\u201d said spokesperson Nicholas Paolucci. \u201cCompanies that violate the city\u2019s consumer protection laws should be held fully accountable. New Yorkers deserve no less.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Exxon, the lead defendant in the case, noted it was the second time a judge has dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by the city.\n\n\u201cAt some point our hope is that political figures around the country come to understand that ideological hatred for us doesn\u2019t mean we did anything wrong,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nOil industry allies welcomed the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe verdict is a \u201cclear indication that courts in New York and around the country are continuing to see through these allegations and that neither the law, nor commonsense, subjects energy producers and sellers to liability for climate change,\u201d said Phil Goldberg, special counsel to the Manufacturers\u2019 Accountability Project, an initiative of the National Association of Manufacturers, which opposes climate liability lawsuits.\n\nThe ruling comes six months after a state judge in Maryland became the first to dismiss a local government\u2019s entire climate change lawsuit. And last January, a state judge in Delaware tossed out parts of the state\u2019s lawsuit against BP, Chevron and other companies.\n\nIf other state courts follow their lead, the rulings could slow the momentum of climate liability litigation, which \u2014 if successful \u2014 could lead to a multibillion-dollar payout to local governments dealing with climate mitigation. Such lawsuits were dealt a major win Monday with the Supreme Court rejecting the industry\u2019s petition to intervene in the cases.\n\nIn the New York case, Patel, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, also found that the city had not proven that the companies duped consumers with campaigns about their support for clean energy and alternative energy sources.\n\nShe wrote that the alleged greenwashing statements were \u201cinactionable,\u201d adding that the city had in some cases used \u201cdistortions of statements that have been taken out of context.\u201d\n\nPatel found that some of the statements \u2014 including an Exxon boast that a fuel would help consumers \u201cdrive cleaner, smarter and longer\u201d \u2014 did not fall under the state\u2019s consumer protection law because they represented \u201cstatements of aspiration, opinion, or puffery.\u201d\n\nShe cited prior cases to argue that such statements are protected against false advertising claims.\n\n\u201cNo reasonable consumer,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwould be misled by these subjective, nonspecific, and vague statements to believe that the use of the Invigorate, Shell V-Power\u00ae NiTRO+, or Synergy\u2122 fuel products does not contribute to climate change.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s lawsuit was filed in April 2021, three weeks after a federal appeals court upheld dismissal of the city\u2019s 2018 lawsuit against Exxon, BP, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. That ruling has become a legal cudgel for the industry.\n\nA federal judge last May rejected the oil industry\u2019s request to transfer the city\u2019s 2021 lawsuit out of state court, where it was first filed, and into federal court.\n\nPatel noted in her decision that the new lawsuit was \u201ceffectively re-purposing\u201d many of the allegations in the dismissed 2018 lawsuit to make a claim under the state\u2019s consumer protection law.\n\nSeparately, in the Maryland case, the city of Baltimore filed an appeal Monday with the state\u2019s Appellate Court, arguing that the lower court \u201cfundamentally misconstrued the city\u2019s case\u201d when it dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nJudge Videtta Brown of the Baltimore City Circuit Court ruled in July that the city\u2019s 2018 challenge against BP and other oil producers went \u201cbeyond the limits of Maryland state law.\u201d\n\nBut Baltimore argued in its appeal that its lawsuit doesn\u2019t seek to regulate air pollution and instead targets the industry\u2019s \u201cextravagant misinformation campaign that contributed to the city\u2019s injuries in breach of Maryland tort duties.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, Baltimore argues, \u201cdoes not allege defendants violated a legal duty by manufacturing or burning fossil fuels, or by polluting.\u201d",

            "content": "A New York State Supreme Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by New York City against major oil companies ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell, alleging they misled the public about their products' impact on climate change and their commitment to renewable energy.\n\nJustice Anar Patel ruled that the city could not simultaneously claim its residents were both aware of the link between fossil fuels and climate change and yet deceived by the oil companies' marketing. \"The city cannot have it both ways,\" Patel wrote in her decision. She found no evidence that the companies, along with the American Petroleum Institute, engaged in \u201cgreenwashing\u201d campaigns designed to boost fossil fuel sales within the city. The judge also dismissed arguments that general marketing statements, such as Exxon's claim that its fuel helps people drive \"cleaner, smarter and longer,\" constituted misleading information about the products' contribution to climate change.\n\nNew York City, with its 8.3 million residents, had argued that the companies\u2019 advertising and social media presence falsely portrayed them as leaders in combating climate change, despite minimal investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The city sought civil fines and an injunction to halt the alleged deceptive practices.\n\nNicholas Paolucci, a spokesperson for the city's law department, stated that the city is reviewing its legal options. \"Our complaint alleged that these defendants spent millions to mislead consumers to think that they, and their products, contribute to a clean energy future,\" Paolucci said. \"They do not. Companies that violate the city's consumer protection laws should be held fully accountable. New Yorkers deserve no less.\"\n\nExxonMobil responded to the ruling with a statement expressing hope that \u201cpolitical figures around the country come to understand that ideological hatred for us doesn't mean we did anything wrong.\u201d\n\nThis lawsuit is one of many brought by U.S. state and local governments against oil companies concerning their role in climate change, specifically regarding the emission of greenhouse gases. The dismissal comes just a day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block a similar lawsuit filed by the city of Honolulu against the same oil companies.\n\nThis is not the first legal setback for New York City in its pursuit of climate-related litigation against these companies. In April 2021, a federal appeals court rejected a separate lawsuit seeking to hold ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips liable for the city's costs associated with global warming.\n\nThe case is titled City of New York v. Exxon Mobil Corp et al, and was heard in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County. The dismissal marks a significant win for the oil industry in the ongoing legal battles over climate change responsibility.",

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.83%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 1.65%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 2.45%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the oil and natural gas company had gained 1.58% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 7.35% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.31% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Exxon Mobil in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on January 31, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.63, reflecting a 34.27% decrease from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $88.46 billion, indicating a 4.88% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Exxon Mobil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5.7% lower within the past month. Currently, Exxon Mobil is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Exxon Mobil is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.44. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 8.92 for its industry.\n\nWe can also see that XOM currently has a PEG ratio of 2.89. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry stood at 1.77 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 45, finds itself in the top 18% echelons of all 250+ industries.",

The firm disclosed in the filing that the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund paid it $250,000 for its services related to the litigation over a six-month span last year.\n\nThe legal effort, if successful, could serve as a major blow to ExxonMobil, which would likely be forced to halt much of its massive petrochemical business and pay large compensatory damages. Such an outcome could have devastating downstream impacts on the American economy and energy security.\n\nThe revelation of Forrest's involvement in the effort, meanwhile, provides a window into how foreign interests continue to influence the American legal system and energy sector. Former Chinese Communist Party officials, for example, are funneling millions of dollars in support of American initiatives to replace fossil fuels with green energy, the Free Beacon reported last month.\n\nIt also raises questions about the intent behind the litigation. Forrest, who is worth approximately $22.1 billion, amassed much his wealth through his firm Fortescue Energy, a global mining behemoth that has recently shifted to green energy investments like hydrogen, a power source in which ExxonMobil has also invested.\n\nThe Minderoo Foundation and ExxonMobil did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"I just wanted to tell you about ExxonMobil,\" Forrest remarked during a speech he delivered at Fortescue's 2023 annual shareholder meeting. \"It is the company that faces multiple court actions for lying and misleading, firstly, its own government for decades and, secondly, the global public for decades, and [is] now being held to account in the judicial system for its responsibility for global heating.\"\n\nForrest then blasted ExxonMobil for its expansion into hydrogen power, saying the company uses fossil fuels instead of other green energy sources to produce its hydrogen power. ExxonMobil's blue hydrogen technology, which relies on natural gas, is far more cost-effective than Fortescue's green hydrogen technology.\n\nThe expansion of blue hydrogen by companies like ExxonMobil, then, presents an existential threat for Fortescue and Forrest, who remains Fortescue's largest shareholder and whose wealth is largely locked up in the firm. While Fortescue rose to prominence through its dominance in the global mining sector, the company plans to achieve zero emissions by 2030, which is why it has pursued green hydrogen power investments.\n\nExxonMobil is fighting back against the Forrest-funded litigation. Last week, the company filed a defamation lawsuit against the environmental groups listed as plaintiffs on the lawsuit.\n\nExxonMobil additionally listed Forrest's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund as a defendant and noted Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy's foreign agent registration filings with the Department of Justice. \"Few, if any, plaintiff's law firms have been forced by the Department of Justice to register as agents of a foreign entity,\" ExxonMobil wrote in its complaint.\n\nThe company accused the law firm of hiring the environmental groups listed on the complaint as \"proxies\" and \"placeholders\" for Forrest's nonprofit. ExxonMobil also underscored how Fortescue is a major competitor.\n\n\"Fortescue appears to have adopted a novel strategy for competing against American oil-and-gas producers like ExxonMobil,\" the complaint continued. \"Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and belief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-interested purposes.\"\n\nThe Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund said in a statement to the Guardian that it is not a subsidiary of the Minderoo Foundation or Fortescue. It did not deny that it is controlled by Forrest.\n\nTyson Redenbarger, a partner at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, told the Free Beacon in an email that \"Exxon's Texas lawsuit is a distraction\" aimed at diverting \"attention from the allegations in the California lawsuit which detail how Exxon misled the public on the dangers of plastic.\"\n\n\"The Sierra Club, Surfrider, Heal the Bay and Baykeeper have been exposing the harmful effects of plastic pollution for decades,\" Redenbarger continued. \"Suggesting these highly regarded nonprofits are anyone's 'proxy' or 'stand in' is baseless, and fails to recognize that these nonprofits have been at the forefront of the battle over plastics.\"",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Country, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market was valued at USD 10.67 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 18.21 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 9.15%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market refers to the supply and consumption of fuel used by ships for maritime transportation in the region. Bunker fuel is a critical component in the global shipping industry, which powers commercial vessels, tankers, bulk carriers, and other types of ships. The demand for bunker fuel in the Middle East and Africa is driven by the region's strategic location as a key hub for international shipping routes. Ports in the Middle East, such as those in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, serve as important refueling stations for vessels transiting between Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the region's growing oil production capacity and expanding maritime infrastructure have bolstered its position as a significant player in the global bunker fuel supply chain. As shipping traffic increases, particularly with the rise of trade routes and the expansion of shipping fleets, the demand for bunker fuel in the Middle East and Africa is expected to continue its upward trajectory. Additionally, advancements in fuel efficiency, regulations regarding sulfur content, and the growing adoption of alternative fuels such as LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) are expected to shape the future growth of the market.\n\n\n\nCountries in the region are increasingly investing in modernizing port facilities, fuel storage, and distribution networks, which will facilitate smoother and more efficient fuel supply to ships. With global trade volumes expected to rise, especially with the expansion of emerging markets in Africa and the Middle East, the Bunker Fuel Market in the region will experience sustained growth. This trend is further supported by the rise in maritime shipping activities, including the transportation of goods and raw materials, making the Middle East and Africa a key area for fuel consumption in the maritime industry.\n\n\n\nEuropean energy companies Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies, along with Japan's Mitsui, each acquired a 10% stake in Abu Dhabi's Ruwais LNG project, with Abu Dhabi's state-owned ADNOC retaining the remaining 60%. This project aims to boost the UAE's LNG production capacity to 15 million tons annually by 2028\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nAdoption of Low-Sulfur Bunker Fuels\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent trends shaping the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is the growing adoption of low-sulfur bunker fuels, driven by global environmental regulations and a heightened focus on sustainability. The International Maritime Organization's global sulfur cap, which came into effect in January 2020, mandates that the sulfur content in marine fuels be reduced from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent. This regulatory shift has prompted significant changes in the supply and demand dynamics of bunker fuels across the region, including the Middle East and Africa. The Middle East and Africa saw a 15-20% increase in demand for low-sulfur fuels, particularly in ports like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Suez Canal, as vessels needed to comply with the new sulfur limits.\n\n\n\nShipping companies operating in this region are increasingly adopting low-sulfur fuels to comply with the new regulations and avoid hefty fines. Consequently, bunker fuel suppliers are responding by enhancing their product offerings to meet the demand for cleaner fuels. Suppliers are investing in refining technologies to produce low-sulfur fuel oils, and some are exploring alternative fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), biofuels, and synthetic fuels, which also meet stringent environmental standards.\n\n\n\nThe transition to low-sulfur fuels has not only become a regulatory requirement but also a market differentiator for companies that prioritize environmental responsibility and sustainability. Moreover, many ports in the Middle East and Africa are upgrading their facilities to handle the increased demand for low-sulfur fuels, ensuring that their bunkering services align with global industry standards. This shift toward cleaner fuels is expected to continue as regulations tighten and pressure increases for the shipping industry to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n\n\nIn addition to regulatory compliance, there is also an increasing demand from consumers and stakeholders for environmentally friendly shipping practices. This has prompted shipping companies to not only meet regulatory requirements but to proactively embrace cleaner alternatives in their operations, further fueling the growth of low-sulfur bunker fuels in the region. Africa's bunker fuel consumption was estimated at approximately 5-7 million metric tons in 2023, with a projected annual growth rate of 3-4% driven by increasing maritime trade and regional port development.\n\n\n\nGrowing Interest in Alternative Marine Fuels\n\n\n\nAs part of the broader shift toward sustainability and reducing carbon emissions, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is witnessing a growing interest in alternative marine fuels. These alternative fuels include biofuels, Liquefied Natural Gas, hydrogen, and methanol, which are seen as viable substitutes for traditional marine fuels. The demand for these fuels is primarily driven by the maritime industry's desire to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nBiofuels, in particular, have gained significant traction due to their potential to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping operations. Biofuels can be made from renewable sources such as plant oils, algae, or waste products, making them an attractive option for companies seeking to reduce their environmental impact. While biofuels are not yet widely used in the Middle East and Africa, pilot projects and partnerships are emerging across the region. Several bunkering suppliers are exploring biofuel blending with traditional bunker fuels as a transitional step towards full-scale adoption. Additionally, Liquefied Natural Gas is increasingly seen as an attractive alternative due to its lower carbon emissions compared to conventional marine fuels.\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing carbon emissions, alternative fuels also offer shipping companies the potential to future-proof their operations. Many major international shipping companies are already investing in vessels that are capable of running on these alternative fuels. The increasing focus on decarbonizing the shipping industry is expected to drive significant growth in the demand for alternative marine fuels across the Middle East and Africa, with suppliers and shipping companies working together to establish the infrastructure necessary to support this transition. This trend is likely to continue as both environmental concerns and regulatory pressures grow.\n\n\n\nDigitalization and Automation in Bunkering Operations\n\n\n\nDigitalization and automation are emerging as key trends in the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, as companies seek to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. The adoption of digital technologies, including data analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated fuel management systems, is transforming the way bunker fuel is delivered and consumed in the region.\n\n\n\nThrough digital platforms, bunker fuel suppliers can now track fuel consumption, monitor delivery schedules, and predict future demand, enabling them to optimize inventory and improve fuel delivery efficiency. Real-time data also allows for better decision-making, ensuring that fuel is delivered at the right time and in the right quantities, reducing waste and minimizing operational disruptions. Furthermore, digitalization allows shipping companies to have greater visibility into their fuel consumption patterns, helping them identify potential inefficiencies and implement more sustainable practices.\n\n\n\nThe use of automated systems in the bunkering process also enhances safety and reduces human error, which is especially important in high-risk environments such as refueling operations. Automation in fuel delivery, invoicing, and payment processes is making the entire bunkering process more seamless, streamlined, and transparent. Additionally, blockchain technology is being explored as a way to improve transparency in fuel transactions, ensuring that all stakeholders involved in the bunkering process have access to secure, verifiable data.\n\n\n\nAs digitalization continues to evolve, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market is likely to see increased investment in innovative technologies, further improving the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of bunker fuel operations. This trend is expected to benefit both bunker fuel suppliers and customers, as digital and automated solutions contribute to cost reductions, better fuel management, and more environmentally responsible practices.\n\n\n\nCountry Insights\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Saudi Arabia dominated the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market and is expected to maintain its leading position throughout the forecast period. Saudi Arabia's dominance is primarily driven by its strategic geographic location along major international shipping routes, especially the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, which positions the country as a key hub for maritime fuel supply in the region.\n\n\n\nThe country's well-developed infrastructure, including major ports like Jeddah and Dammam, facilitates the efficient distribution of bunker fuel to vessels operating in these critical trade routes. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's significant oil reserves and established refineries contribute to its competitive advantage in providing reliable and cost-effective bunker fuel. The growing shipping industry in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the government's investments in port expansion and maritime infrastructure, further strengthens its position in the bunker fuel market.\n\n\n\nWhile the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also key players, particularly in fueling international maritime traffic due to their advanced ports and oil exports, Saudi Arabia's larger fleet and proximity to major shipping lanes give it a continued edge. Egypt is another strong contender, particularly with the Suez Canal playing a pivotal role in global shipping, but its bunker fuel demand remains secondary to that of Saudi Arabia. Other regions such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Turkey are important contributors, but they do not match the scale and infrastructure dominance of Saudi Arabia. Given these factors, Saudi Arabia is poised to retain its dominance in the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market as the region's maritime activity and fuel demand continue to grow in the coming years.\n\n\n\nKey Market Players\n\nExxon Mobil\n\nBP\n\nShell International\n\nChevron\n\nTotalEnergies\n\nSaudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)\n\nENOC Company\n\nQatarEnergy\n\nKuwait Petroleum Corporation\n\nNational Iranian Oil Company\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 133 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $10.67 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $18.21 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 9.1% Regions Covered Africa, Middle East\n\nReport Scope:\n\n\n\nIn this report, the Middle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market has been segmented into the following categories, in addition to the industry trends which have also been detailed below:\n\n\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Fuel Type:\n\nIFO (Intermediate Fuel Oil)\n\nMDO (Marine Diesel Oil)\n\nMGO (Marine Gas Oil)\n\nLNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)\n\nOthers\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Vessel Type:\n\nLarge Ships\n\nMedium Ships\n\nSmall Ships\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By Application:\n\nCommercial Shipping\n\nTankers\n\nBulk Carriers\n\nContainer Ships\n\nPassenger Ships\n\nOthers\n\nMiddle East and Africa Bunker Fuel Market, By End-User:\n\nShip Owners\n\nFuel Suppliers\n\nGovernment and Defense\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/43wjbl\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corp. has discovered natural gas off the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, marking a potentially pivotal moment for the nation as it seeks to revive declining production levels, according to the several media reports. The Texas-based energy giant announced the successful completion of its exploratory Nefertari-1 well in the North Marakia Block, situated roughly five miles off Egypt\u2019s northern coastline. In a statement, Exxon revealed that \"gas-bearing reservoirs were encountered\" and confirmed ongoing evaluations of the findings.\n\nThe Eastern Mediterranean has garnered significant attention as a hotspot for natural gas exploration following major discoveries off the coast of Israel in 2009 and 2010. This region's strategic location, close to energy-hungry markets in Europe and the Middle East, enhances the economic appeal of any new reserves. However, political instability in the area presents a notable challenge to sustained development. Other global energy players, including Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Shell Plc, and Eni SpA, also hold stakes and maintain active exploration projects in the region.\n\nExxon initially entered the North Marakia Block in 2019, subsequently selling a 40% stake to QatarEnergy in 2022. The drilling of the Nefertari-1 well was executed using Valaris Ltd.\u2019s DS9 drillship.\n\nEgypt, once poised to become a critical energy hub and supplier to Europe, has faced significant hurdles in maintaining its natural gas output. In June, production dropped to its lowest levels since 2017, compelling the nation to increase imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to levels not seen in six years. These challenges have been exacerbated by a severe dollar shortage, which has led foreign energy companies to curtail investments due to overdue payments from the Egyptian government.\n\nTo address these setbacks, Egypt has initiated a monthly repayment program aimed at regaining investor confidence and revitalizing production. The government is targeting a return to natural gas exports by the end of 2027. Efforts to bolster output are already underway, with Eni SpA announcing plans to enhance production at its flagship Zohr gas field and BP Plc gearing up to commence operations at two new gas wells in the Raven Field by February. Meanwhile, Apache is actively expanding both oil and gas production in Egypt\u2019s Western Desert.\n\nExxon\u2019s recent discovery, alongside ongoing developments by other major players, underscores the significant potential of the Eastern Mediterranean as a key energy-producing region. However, its long-term impact will depend on Egypt's ability to address its economic challenges and restore stability to its energy sector.",

            "content": "After sitting vacant for nearly a decade, hopes for revitalizing one of Houston's tallest and oldest office towers are fizzling out with the developer's plan to offload the building.\n\nAn affiliate of CMI Developers has listed 800 Bell, the more than 1.3 million-square-foot skyscraper that has been sitting empty since Exxon Mobil relocated from the downtown tower in 2015. Texas-based brokerage Lumicre has been brought on to help market the building since it was put up for sale earlier this month.\n\nThe listing lands about two years after the New York-based investment firm that has a track record of historic redevelopments and conversions acquired the property with plans to overhaul it into housing. CMI closed the deal with seller Shorenstein Properties in late 2022 for an undisclosed amount, according to CoStar data, fueling optimism that the new ownership would be the long-awaited catalyst both for the tower as well as the downtown area.\n\nIt isn't clear how far the developer got in its pursuit of a residential conversion. Neither CMI nor Lumicre immediately responded to CoStar News' requests for comment about the decision to sell the former Exxon building. Marketing materials describe 800 Bell as an \"iconic skyscraper\" that has been a longstanding fixture for the Houston skyline \u2014 even if it is barren.\n\n\"Designed for versatility, this building is ideal for use as a corporate or secondary headquarters,\" according to marketing materials. However, if a potential bidder is interested in picking up where CMI left off, the tower also has \"the potential for conversion to alternative uses.\"\n\nLanguished plans\n\nThe move to offload the 46-story building is the latest update for the Houston high-rise dating back to Shorenstein's own $50 million acquisition in 2013.\n\nThe San Francisco-based developer purchased the tower as part of a sale-leaseback agreement with Exxon as the energy giant was in the middle of its own real estate disposition spree. Exxon continued to fill the entirety of the building until 2015 when it relocated employees to its new 385-acre corporate-owned campus in north Houston.\n\nShorenstein had originally planned to start a major revamp of the tower once Exxon moved out. Houston's office market at the time was booming thanks to a surge in demand among energy companies. However, plummeting oil prices in 2015 triggered a spike in vacancies as companies quickly shed office space and complicated efforts to overhaul the Exxon tower.\n\nAfter more than seven years of failing to land a tenant, Shorenstein's redevelopment plans never reached fruition, and the property was ultimately sold.\n\nDemand across Houston's office market has stabilized in recent years but is still facing pandemic-induced challenges. At nearly 19.5%, the city has the second-highest vacancy rate in the country behind only San Francisco, according to CoStar data, and the leases that are getting signed average about 10% smaller than in the years leading up to 2020.\n\nWith tenants holding much of the power, demand for space has been concentrated on the pool of high-quality buildings stocked with desirable amenities and located in mixed-use environments, attributes for which the Exxon tower has struggled to compete.\n\nEven with the property being listed for sale, Lumicre is still actively marketing it for a prospective tenant, leaning more on the building's history and adaptability rather than features where it may come up short.\n\nThe tower is \"a canvas ready for transformation [and] features contemporary architecture and flexible floor plans, ideal for creating a personalized environment,\" according to brokerage materials. \"Once the grandest building west of the Mississippi River, it invites you to be a part of its living narrative and seize the opportunity to make this iconic address your own.\"",

            "content": "ExxonMobil on Monday filed a lawsuit against California Attorney General Rob Bonta, alleging that he and several environmental groups defamed the global oil and chemical company \u201cfor politics, publicity and private gain.\u201d\n\nThe company is seeking monetary damages plus public recognition that chemical recycling \u201cis recognized and permitted by law in multiple states, including Texas,\u201d where ExxonMobil is headquartered. The suit was filed in federal court in the Eastern Texas district.\n\nBonta filed suit against ExxonMobil in September, seeking to \u201chold one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world accountable for misleading the public on plastic\u2019s recyclability and polluting California\u2019s environment and communities,\u201d according to a press release at the time.\n\nIn the suit, ExxonMobil says, \u201cDefendants are repeatedly and publicly attacking ExxonMobil with false accusations of being a \u2018liar\u2019 and declarations that advanced recycling is a \u2018myth\u2019 and a \u2018sham.'\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the California Department of Justice said via email, \u201cThis is another attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception. The Attorney General is proud to advance his lawsuit against ExxonMobil and looks forward to vigorously litigating this case in court.\n\nIn an emailed statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said, \u201cThis campaign of lies designed to derail our advanced recycling business must stop. We refuse to let others attack our reputation and technology for their financial and political gain.\u201d\n\nLegal challenges to plastic recycling continue to build\n\nAs 2024 wound to close, ExxonMobil and other major plastic resin producers were hit with two similar recycling-related class-action lawsuits seeking to recoup costs for plastic pollution.\n\nIn the first, Ford County in Kansas is suing ExxonMobil, Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dupont, Celanese, Dow, Eastman Chemical, LyondellBasell Industries and the American Chemistry Council, alleging their decades of claims about plastics recyclability caused harm.\n\nIn the second suit, filed in federal court in western Missouri in mid-December, four residents of Missouri, Kansas, California and Florida are suing 11 entities including ExxonMobil, Chevron and the American Chemistry Council. The lawsuit seeks to remedy harm the plaintiffs say the companies caused through misleading recycling claims.\n\nThe suits were filed in federal courts in Kansas and Missouri by Sharp Law, based in greater Kansas City.\n\nThe Kansas suit defines the class to include all 105 counties in the state that have incurred or will incur cleanup costs for plastic waste starting January 1, 1989.\n\nThe companies named in both suits are mostly PE producers, although unlike many other legal actions, these lawsuits also name producers of chemical intermediates used to make polymers. For example, Celanese produces acetic acid, which is used to make PET.\n\nThe suits allege that, driven by profit, the named companies misrepresented the recyclability of plastics, and that as a result more plastics were produced and purchased than otherwise would have been, leading to higher pricing for plastics and \u201cmassive sanitation problems\u201d for local jurisdictions.\n\nLocated about 150 miles west of Wichita, Ford County is in sparsely populated southwestern Kansas, with a population of about 34,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the beef processing industry is by far the biggest employer in the area, according to the Dodge City/Ford County Development Corporation.\n\nSharp Law, based in greater Kansas City, filed the Ford County suit Nov. 27, along with two other Kansas firms on behalf of Ford County. The firm also filed the Missouri suit Dec. 16, on behalf of the four named plaintiffs and on behalf of \u201call persons or entities in the United States and its territories who indirectly purchased plastics\u201d starting January 1, 1990.\n\nThe suits add that \u201cthe plastics industry \u2013 which includes petrochemical companies, their trade associations, and the front groups that represent their interests \u2013 should be held accountable for their campaign of deception much like the producers of tobacco, opioids, and toxic chemicals that engaged in similar schemes.\u201d\n\nSharp Law lists several successful multimillion-dollar class-action settlements on its website, and has experience in antitrust, consumer protection and oil and gas disputes. The settlements listed include judgments against ExxonMobil in 2012 and PVC producer Oxy USA in 2022 concerning royalties from crude oil and natural gas leases on land in Kansas.\n\nRex Sharp, co-counsel for the Ford County suit, did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.\n\nList of recycling lawsuits grows\n\nIn the past few years, governments and organizations have increasingly resorted to legal means to address plastic pollution, with some organizations offering guidance such as the \u201cMaking Plastic Polluters Pay\u201d report from the Center for International Environmental Law or encouraging public-private partnerships.\n\nRecent cases surrounding claims of plastic recyclability have included New York and Baltimore suing PepsiCo and other major packaging users; a suit against Danone; and one against Colgate-Palmolive.\n\nIn 2023, Reynolds Consumer Products agreed to change advertising language and pay up to $4 million to settle one of multiple lawsuits alleging its marketing of recycling collection bags was illegal. And in 2022, Keurig Dr Pepper settled a class-action suit for $10 million regarding coffee pod recyclability claims, and Canadian officials forced Keurig Canada to alter its recyclability claims and pay about $2.37 million in penalties.\n\nIndustry reaction\n\nBoth complaints are \u201clittered with claims that are inaccurate, misleading and out of date,\u201d said Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, in an emailed statement, adding that the filings use text directly from activist action plans and cite \u201cextremist groups such as Greenpeace and Beyond Plastics as sources.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Plastic Makers comprises the plastics division of the American Chemistry Council and ACC member companies including ExxonMobil, LyondellBasell and Shell Chemical.\n\nThe suits say that \u201conly a tiny fraction of plastics are ever recycled,\u201d citing data from Greenpeace and activist group Beyond Plastics.\n\nThe 2024 \u201cState of Recycling\u201d report from The Recycling Partnership estimated that only 21% of household recyclables were recovered \u2013 including 55% of both PET bottles and aluminum cans, 43% of non-bottle PET, 59% of HDPE bottles and jars, 30% of PP, 20% of film and flexibles and 47% of steel cans. The TRP report added that recyclable material largely ends up in landfills due to lack of access to recycling services and a lack of education and communication.\n\nAnd the National Association for PET Container Resources industry group recently reported that recycling for PET bottles in the U.S. in 2023 reached 33%, the highest rate since 1996.\n\nIn an emailed statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said such lawsuits \u201cdo nothing to advance solutions to plastic waste and pollution.\u201d The spokesperson added that the company continues to invest in keeping plastics out of landfills.\n\nEisenberg echoed the sentiment: \u201cIt would be far more helpful to its citizens and the environment if Ford County invested more in its own recycling infrastructure instead of bringing a misguided lawsuit. ACC looks forward to refuting these meritless allegations and plans to vigorously oppose the claims.\u201d\n\nA version of this story appeared in Plastics Recycling Update on Jan. 8.\n\nMore stories about courts/lawsuits",

The region\u2019s proximity to gas-hungry markets in Europe and the Middle East helps bolster the potential economic viability of any discovery, but its political instability is a challenge. Chevron Corp., BP Plc, Shell Plc and Eni SpA also have assets and exploration plans in the area.\n\nExxon announced its entry into the North Marakia block in 2019 and sold a 40% stake to QatarEnergy in 2022.\n\nThe well was drilled with Valaris Ltd.\u2019s DS9 drillship, Exxon said.\n\nWhile Egypt had once planned to become a key energy hub and supplier for Europe, its gas production declined to the lowest since 2017 in June, forcing Cairo to increase liquefied natural gas imports to the highest in about six years. An acute dollar shortage prompted foreign energy companies to slow down investments after accumulated arrears owed to them by the government.\n\nThe state has since embarked on a plan for monthly repayments to reinvigorate investments and production, with Egypt hoping to return to exporting the fuel by the end of 2027.\n\nEni SpA said late last year it plans drilling operations to increase gas production that had been diminishing at its flagship Zohr gas field. BP Plc expects to start output from two new gas wells at its Raven Field in February, while Apache is boosting both oil and gas production in the Western Desert.\n\n(Updates with context on Egypt gas production from sixth paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Each lift consists of one million barrels of oil.\n\nThe total sum earned for the oil lifts was not provided as the process involves sale and verification and the government is now finalising the verification.\n\n\u201cThere is no fixed price for a lift, it depends on the market price,\u201d Minister Bharrat explained.\n\nAnd now, for the first time, since Guyana began producing crude oil, the country is receiving a premium of over US$1 per barrel for crude marketed from the Destiny FPSO, earning additional revenue.\n\n\u201cWhen we started out in 2020 Shell was marketing our crude, we were paying Shell to market our crude after that I think it was BP, then Saudi Aramco and now we have two companies that are paying us a premium to off take our crude we have BP Energy which is paying close to US$1 as well as JE [Energy] which is paying more than US$1, for the first time,\u201d Bharrat explained as he announced the milestone.\n\nA premium payment is an amount paid above the standard market price for crude oil.

            "content": "Dividends hold particular significance, especially as the broader market has experienced consecutive gains of over 20%, a scenario not seen since the late 1990s. Moreover, the low payout ratio, currently at 29% compared to the historical average of 50%, suggests there is considerable potential for companies to increase their dividend payouts. Kwon pointed out that another key factor supporting dividend investing is the growing number of retired baby boomers seeking income. With cash products yielding around 4%, there is a strong demand for dividends, as investors are looking for immediate cash returns and are pressuring companies to increase their dividend distributions.\n\nDividends historically accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total return from 1936 to 2012 but have contributed only 16% over the past ten years, according to a research note from BofA Securities released late last year. Looking forward, Kwon anticipates that dividends will have a more significant impact on total returns compared to the previous decade.\n\nAnalysts note that, from a broad perspective, earnings growth has traditionally been the primary driver of dividends. Last year saw strong earnings growth, and they anticipate an even better performance in 2025. Goldman predicts an 11% increase in earnings per share for this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024. This is expected to result in a 7% rise in dividends, compared to a 6% increase last year. Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 12% boost in dividends this year, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nThe year 2024 proved favorable for dividends, even though the Dividend Aristocrats Index lagged behind the broader market. Throughout the year, US companies consistently increased or upheld their dividend payouts. In addition, several major tech firms began offering dividends, signaling to investors that it's possible for a company to focus on both growth and shareholder returns. By September 30, 2024, approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P index were distributing dividends, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past decade. Notably, nearly 24% of these dividend-paying firms were in the technology sector, a significant increase from 13% ten years ago. Sectors such as healthcare and industrials also experienced notable growth in the number of companies offering dividends. This broader distribution of dividends has expanded the range of investment opportunities, giving equity-income investors more access to high-growth, dynamic, and innovative companies. Given these developments, analysts remain optimistic about their performance heading into 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis optimism about dividend stocks is largely rooted in their historical performance, as they have been instrumental in reducing overall portfolio volatility and can help cushion losses when stock prices decline. Research indicates that dividend-paying stocks often outperform their non-dividend-paying counterparts during bear markets, such as during the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. This may be because companies that pay dividends are typically larger, more established, and more profitable, making them more resilient than the broader market.\n\nFrom October 2019 to September 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in the market\u2019s total performance, equity income funds demonstrated lower volatility and reduced downside risk compared to the broader market. Given this, we will discuss the most reliable dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to identify companies with a history of dividend growth spanning over 10 years. From this group, we selected companies offering dividend yields of at least 1% as of January 12. From that selection, we identified the ten stocks that hedge funds favored the most during the third quarter of 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Community members, collaborators and representatives from MD Anderson kicked off the 10-year initiative today in Beaumont.\n\nBe Well Beaumont aims to promote wellness and to lower cancer risk among community members by providing them with cancer prevention education and tools. This builds on Be Well\u2122 Baytown, MD Anderson\u2019s inaugural program that has been supported by ExxonMobil since 2016. That initiative has reached more than 80% of residents, providing wellness strategies that have been implemented by 20 local organizations.\n\n\u201cThe Baytown initiative demonstrated what can be achieved through effective community partnerships led by two world-class organizations,\u201d said Darren Woods, ExxonMobil chairman and CEO. \u201cIt is driving meaningful health and wellness benefits and we\u2019re proud to team up again with MD Anderson to bring the same program to Beaumont in support of our neighbors and employees in that community.\u201d\n\nBe Well Communities\u2122, MD Anderson\u2019s place-based strategy for comprehensive cancer prevention and control, unites individuals, schools, workplaces, government agencies, health care providers and policymakers to plan and carry out sustainable, community-led solutions that make positive, long-lasting changes in people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cCancer prevention is a cornerstone of our mission to end cancer,\u201d said Peter WT Pisters, M.D., president of MD Anderson. \u201cWe are grateful for ExxonMobil\u2019s continued support to implement life-changing programs in communities like Beaumont and Baytown, where we can directly impact cancer risk reduction and provide tangible differences for countless families.\u201d\n\nResearch indicates that up to half of cancer cases can be prevented through consistent healthy lifestyle choices, including exercising, avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol, eating a balanced diet, maintaining an appropriate weight, protecting your skin from the sun, completing cancer prevention vaccines, getting cancer screening exams and discussing your family history with your doctor.\n\nNew initiative informed by proven model of impact\n\nMD Anderson\u2019s Be Well Communities are built on 100 years of best practices, literature and experience in healthy community initiatives. The model centers on working with community-based organizations to build their capacity to deliver and evaluate evidence-based interventions.\n\nTogether with ExxonMobil, MD Anderson aims to create strong community linkages, to advance professional and policy changes, to establish an active health coalition, and to create a sustainability plan to transition the initiative to the community.\n\n\u201cIt is a privilege to have the opportunity to work with leaders across Beaumont to implement collaborative change in the way people work, eat and play,\u201d said Ruth Rechis, Ph.D., executive director ad interim of the cancer prevention and control platform at MD Anderson. \u201cWe are excited to get to know people in the community and cultivate strong and meaningful relationships.\u201d\n\nProgram areas of focus for Be Well Beaumont may include:\n\nHealthy eating: increasing the amount of healthy food distributed and providing nutrition education\n\nActive living: increasing the percentage of students and adults engaged in physical activity and improving parks and outdoor spaces for safe physical activity\n\nSun safety: providing sun-safety education and installing sunshades across the city\n\nTobacco-free living: providing education on the harms of tobacco use and vaping\n\nPreventive care: increasing access to cancer screenings and HPV vaccinations\n\nThrough the support of ExxonMobil\u2019s $10 million commitment, Be Well Beaumont will be implemented over the next 10 years; leadership will transition to the community in 2034.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 358 points, or 0.9%, while the weakness for Big Tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 0.4%.\n\nStocks have been under pressure the last month, and the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth losing week in the last five as traders cull expectations for how much relief the Federal Reserve may deliver this year through lower interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch cuts would give the economy a boost, and the U.S. stock market ran to repeated records last year on the assumption that more are coming after the Fed began lowering rates in September. But inflation has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and recent reports have suggested a still-solid U.S. economy doesn\u2019t need much help. Questions are growing about whether the Fed will deliver even a single cut in 2025.\n\nHigh rates put downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments, and those seen as expensive can feel the stiffest punches. Nvidia fell 2% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500, though that represents just a smidgen of its huge gains made in recent years. The chip company\u2019s stock had nearly quintupled over the last three years amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nApple\u2019s 1% slip and Meta Platforms\u2019 fall of 1.2% were also among the heaviest weights on the market. Because they\u2019re two of the largest companies on Wall Street, their moves pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other stocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModerna tumbled 16.8% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after giving a forecast for revenue this upcoming year that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. The vaccine maker, which is seeing a slowdown in COVID-related sales, is accelerating a cost-cutting program.\n\nMacy\u2019s fell 8.1% after saying it will likely report revenue for the last three months of 2024 that\u2019s at or slightly below the low end of the forecasted range it had earlier given. It\u2019s a potentially discouraging signal about spending during the holiday season after strong spending by U.S. households has helped keep the economy out of a recession.\n\nEdison International fell 11.9% as wildfires continue to burn in the territory of its Southern California Edison utility. The utility has said fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment was involved in the ignition of the Hurst fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the winning side of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies after the price of oil climbed. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $78.82, while Brent crude climbed 1.6% to $81.01. The Biden administration said Friday it\u2019s expanding sanctions against Russia\u2019s energy industry.\n\nExxon Mobil gained 2.6%, and Valero Energy jumped 4.9%.\n\nShares of U.S. Steel rallied 6.1% after the Biden administration pushed back to June the deadline it imposed for the Pittsburgh-based company to unwind its proposed acquisition by Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel.\n\nIntra-Cellular Therapies soared 34.1% after Johnson & Johnson said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company and its treatment for bipolar I and II depression for $132 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7%.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 added 9.18 points to 5,836.22.

It\u2019s been climbing relentlessly over the last month, and it was below 3.65% just in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strong reports on the U.S. economy have helped push yields higher. So have worries that tariffs and other policies possibly coming from President-elect Donald Trump could boost inflation along with economic growth.\n\nA report coming on Wednesday could offer the next spark for the bond market. That\u2019s when the government will deliver the latest monthly update on inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling. Economists expect it to show inflation accelerated a touch to 2.8% in December from 2.7% in November.\n\n\u201cRates remain the most important variable for equity market direction,\u201d according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley.\n\nOutside of the inflation data and their effect on interest rates, this upcoming week will also feature earnings reports from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and other big banks. They\u2019re helping to kick off the start of earnings reporting season.\n\nIf Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across most of Europe and Asia.\n\nStocks sank 1% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai, even though China reported its exports grew at a faster pace in December than expected. Factories were rushing to fill orders to beat higher tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose once he takes office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoe writes for the Associated Press.

Other defendants in the lawsuit include Exxon Mobil XOM.N, BP BP.L, Shell SHEL.L, ConocoPhillips COP.N, BHP Group BHP.AX, Marathon Petroleum MCP.N and Chevron CVX.N.\n\nThe suit was filed in 2020 by the city and county of Honolulu and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply, a semi-autonomous city agency. The plaintiffs said misleading statements made by the companies about the impact of their fossil fuel products paved the way for property and infrastructure damage caused by human-induced climate change.\n\nThe plaintiffs have sought unspecified monetary damages. Honolulu is located on Hawaii\u2019s Oahu island.\n\nThe lawsuit said that heat waves linked to climate change have stressed the city\u2019s electrical grid, and that a wastewater treatment plant would need to be retrofitted against sea level rise at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, among other harms.\n\nBen Sullivan, an official at the City and County of Honolulu\u2019s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, hailed the Supreme Court\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant day for the people of Honolulu and the rule of law. This landmark decision upholds our right to enforce Hawaii laws in Hawaii courts, ensuring the protection of Hawaii taxpayers and communities from the immense costs and consequences of the climate crisis caused by the defendants\u2019 misconduct,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nHonolulu is among various U.S. jurisdictions to have filed suits seeking monetary damages from companies that extract, produce, distribute or sell fossil fuels, arguing that their activities contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases linked to climate change.\n\n\u201cDefendants have known for more than 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products would have a significant adverse impact on the Earth\u2019s climate and sea levels,\u201d the Honolulu lawsuit stated.\n\nInstead of warning the public about the known consequences of using their products or working to minimize associated damage, the companies \u201cconcealed the dangers, promoted false and misleading information, sought to undermine public support for greenhouse gas regulation, and engaged in massive campaigns to promote the ever-increasing use of their products at ever-greater volumes,\u201d the lawsuit added.\n\nAmong other consequences of this conduct, the lawsuit said, the average sea level will rise substantially along the Honolulu Pacific coastline, causing flooding, erosion and beach loss, and extreme weather affecting the region will become more frequent.\n\nThe companies urged a trial judge to dismiss the suit, arguing that the claims made under state law were preempted, or blocked, by federal law because those Hawaii statutes sought to regulate interstate emissions or commerce, powers reserved for the federal government.\n\nHawaii Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Crabtree denied that request. The Hawaii Supreme Court in October 2023 upheld the judge\u2019s ruling, prompting the oil companies to appeal to the justices.",

            "content": "ExxonMobil (XOM -0.42%) is the oil industry's leader by almost every important metric, including profitability. The oil giant produced a peer-leading $8.6 billion in profits during the third quarter and a monster $17.6 billion of cash flow from operations, which also led international oil companies.\n\nHowever, the fourth quarter proved more challenging for the oil giant as it issued a profit warning for the period. Here's a look at whether that's a concern or investors should buy the oil stock on its profit dip.\n\nDrilling down into the fourth quarter\n\nExxonMobil recently gave investors a preliminary glimpse at its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, which it plans to release at the end of the month. The oil giant expects to report $1.76 per share of earnings in the period, well below analysts' expectations. It's also below the $2.48 per share it posted in the year-ago period and the $1.92 per share it earned during the third quarter.\n\nThe oil giant battled several headwinds during the period. The biggest came in refining. Lower margins reduced earnings by between $300 million and $700 million in the period. Timing also impacted its refining business, cutting an additional $500 million to $900 million from the bottom line. Gasoline demand was weaker than expected, while new refineries in Asia and Africa boosted supply.\n\nAnother issue that weighed on Exxon's profits in the period was impairments. The company disclosed that it would take about $600 million in charges during the period. It also expects lower margins in its chemicals business to reduce earnings by roughly $400 million.\n\nThese headwinds offset the strength of the company's upstream oil and gas production business. Exxon expects earnings from that segment to increase by around $400 million despite a 6% decline in oil prices during the period. Exxon benefited from a roughly 30% rebound in the price of natural gas in the U.S.\n\nTime to worry or time to buy?\n\nMarket conditions had a notable impact on Exxon's earnings during the fourth quarter. However, while its earnings declined during the period, it's still in a class of its own. Further, the company expects to improve its already industry-leading profitability in the future.\n\nThe company recently revealed its 2030 plan. It aims to deliver an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in free cash flow by 2030. Several factors will fuel that ambitious plan, including:\n\nPioneer Natural Resources: Exxon expects the annual synergies from its recently closed acquisition of Pioneer to be 50% more than initially expected, or about $3 billion.\n\nNew business : The oil company expects to grow the earnings from new businesses (e.g., The oil company expects to grow the earnings from new businesses (e.g., lithium carbon capture and storage , and others) to $3 billion.\n\nStructural cost savings : Exxon is adding $7 billion to its structural cost savings target.\n\nHigh-return capital investments : The company plans to deploy $140 billion over the next several years into major capital projects and developing the Permian Basin. These investments should generate returns above 30% by growing its high-margin production from advantaged assets and high-value products.\n\nExxon's strategy has it on track to produce a massive $165 billion in surplus cash after covering its investment program by 2030. That will give it the money to continue increasing its dividend, which it has done for 42 straight years. It will also enable the company to continue buying back a boatload of its stock. Assuming reasonable market conditions, it plans to repurchase $20 billion of its shares in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThat combination of earnings and cash-flow growth, along with increased capital returns, positions Exxon to create significant value for investors over the coming years. The company's strategy will help make it less susceptible to swings in commodity prices by significantly increasing its margins, growing earnings from more resilient businesses, and delivering durable cost savings.\n\nAn attractive entry point for this top-tier oil stock\n\nWeaker market conditions cut into Exxon's profits during the fourth quarter. They've also weighed on its stock price, which currently sits about 15% below its 52-week high. That dip looks like a great buying opportunity for long-term investors, given all the growth the oil giant has coming down the pipeline.",

In this case, if resistance 110 is being tested, so a short signal would exist.\n\nSwing Trading Plans for XOM\n\nBuy XOM slightly over 107.6, target 109.6, Stop Loss @ 107.29 Details\n\nIf 107.6 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy XOM just slightly over 107.6, with an upside target of 109.6. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 107.29 in case the stock turns against the trade. 107.6 is the first level of resistance above 106.54, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 107.6, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short XOM slightly near 107.6, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 107.91. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of XOM if it tests 107.6 with a downside target of n/a. We should have a stop loss in place at 107.91 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade. By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal.

            "content": "American Airlines Inc. violated federal law by filling its 401(k) plan with funds from investment companies that pursue environmental, social, and corporate governance goals, a Texas federal judge ruled Friday in the biggest victory yet for opponents of the strategy.\n\nThe airline breached its fiduciary duty of loyalty\u2014but not its fiduciary duty of prudence\u2014in allowing its $26 billion retirement plan to be influenced by corporate goals unrelated to workers\u2019 best financial interests, Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas said after a four-day, non-jury trial.\n\nThe 2023 lawsuit, which says the airline wrongly offered 401(k) funds managed by companies that pursue ESG policy goals through proxy voting and shareholder activism, is the latest battle in the broader debate over socially conscious investing.\n\nA decision on the validity of these investment strategies in 401(k) plans would have ripple effects, particularly within the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which recently sent a case seeking to prevent enforcement of the Labor Department\u2019s ESG-friendly investing rule back to district court.\n\nDisloyal, Not Imprudent\n\nAccording to O\u2019Connor, the American pilots proved that the airline\u2019s activities\u2014which included hiring BlackRock Inc. to manage billions of dollars in plan assets despite its \u201cESG-oriented investing and proxy voting activism\"\u2014violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act\u2019s directive to act loyally and in the best interests of plan participants.\n\n\u201cERISA does not permit a fiduciary to pursue a non-pecuniary interest no matter how noble it might view the aim,\u201d O\u2019Connor said, asserting that ESG investments \u201coften underperform traditional investments by approximately 10%.\u201d\n\nBut the pilots failed to prove a violation of the statute\u2019s prudence rule, he said, because the airline \u201cacted according to prevailing practices and in a manner similar to other fiduciaries in the industry.\u201d That\u2019s true even though those standards may stem from BlackRock\u2019s \u201calarming degree of control and influence over the retirement industry\"\u2014an industry O\u2019Connor described as \u201cincestuous\u201d and full of \u201coligopolist or cartel-like behavior.\u201d\n\nThe pilots\u2019 prudence claim is best understood as an attempt to \u201cshift industry standards\u201d to better prioritize proxy voting oversight as an avenue for protecting workers\u2019 financial interests, O\u2019Connor said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps that shift should occur,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd maybe at some point it will. But this future-looking goal reveals the fatal flaw underlying Plaintiff\u2019s prudence claim: Defendants\u2019 practices were not incongruent with the prevailing industry standards at the time.\u201d\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson said in an emailed statement Saturday that the company \u201calways\u201d acts \u201cindependently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients. Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.\u201d\n\nBlackRock isn\u2019t a party to the suit.\n\nTrial Outcome\n\nO\u2019Connor is a George W. Bush appointee who critics say has been a subject of \u201cforum shopping\u201d by conservative plaintiffs seeking a sympathetic court in challenges to federal policies.\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s prior rulings in the case denied the airline\u2019s motion to dismiss, certified a class of as many as 100,000 plan participants, and allowed the plaintiffs to present their claims at trial.\n\nThe June 2024 trial he oversaw included testimony from the airline\u2019s asset management director, who said his team didn\u2019t believe the negative press surrounding BlackRock and proxy voting was a reason for the airline to be concerned over the firm\u2019s handling of pilot retirement plans.\n\nAn expert witness for the pilots testified that BlackRock\u2019s May 2021 proxy vote at ExxonMobil, which focused on ESG priorities, devalued energy stocks and caused the airline\u2019s 401(k) plan to suffer more than $15 million in losses, an estimate American called \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s post-trial opinion, which resolves questions of liability but not potential damages, includes a lengthy discussion of which types of investments fall within the ESG rubric.\n\nAccording to O\u2019Connor, ESG investing \u201cconsiders or pursues a non-pecuniary interest as an end itself rather than as a means to some financial end.\u201d Investing aimed at reducing material risks or increasing returns for the sole purpose of seeking financial benefits \u201cis not ESG investing,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Connor instructed the parties to file briefs on damages and other outstanding issues by Jan. 31.\n\nO\u2019Melveny & Myers LLP and Kelly Hart & Hallman LLP represent American. Hacker Stephens LLP and Sharp Law LLP represent the pilots.\n\nThe case is Spence v. Am. Airlines, Inc., N.D. Tex., No. 4:23-cv-00552, 1/10/25.",

            "content": "Texas refineries are bracing for an onslaught of cold, snow and freezing rain as the US South\u2019s first major winter storm sweeps in during what\u2019s projected to be a frigid month.\n\nWhile temperatures in the upcoming storm aren\u2019t expected to hold below freezing for long, the Commodity Weather Group forecasts January will likely be the coldest in 11 years, according to heating degree days value, a way to measure weather-driven energy demand.\n\nThe situation threatens to freeze pipelines, disable instrumentation and processing equipment, and test the state\u2019s power grid, all potential snags for a region that holds the majority of US refining capacity and accounts for much of the country\u2019s fuel supplies. So far, refiners and analysts say the sector is better prepared for winter\u2019s wrath after learning from repeated storms in recent years.\n\n\u201cIf you have a couple of these events in a row, you get more focused, almost like a science experiment,\u201d said Austin Lin, principal analyst refining and products North America at Wood Mackenzie. \u201cThe winterization list gets longer and more focused.\u201d\n\nMotiva Enterprises LLC\u2019s 626,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur refinery, the nation\u2019s largest, has been preparing for months, including adding more insulation, while Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s 609,000 barrel-a-day Beaumont refinery has doubled up work shift staffing, according to people familiar with the preparations.\n\nGlobal Partners, which operates six fuel terminals across Texas, said proactive measures it\u2019s taken include managing water levels to prevent icing and fueling backup generators to address potential power outages. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said its refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Illinois have been winterized \u201cto ensure safe, continuous operations at the expected lower temperatures.\u201d\n\nStill, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state\u2019s grid operator, has warned of potential tight power conditions through Friday due to the storm. All told, about 23 million people from Texas to the southern Appalachian Mountains are under winter storm watches, said Peter Mullinax, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center.\n\nGrid integrity and having enough heat available to run refineries\u2019 process units are major concerns, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.\n\n\u201cIn West Texas, the biggest issues will be ice and the grid,\u201d Lipow said. \u201cIce on the wires could result in power outages.\u201d\n\nTexas is no stranger to winter storms, particularly in the last four years. In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri knocked out power and stopped production at two-thirds of regional refineries. Storm Elliott in December 2022 at its peak disabled more than 2 million barrels of crude capacity.\n\nWith supplies plentiful, the bigger problem for the industry may be reduced demand from the weather keeping people at home, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Lin said. And because the storm isn\u2019t expected to be lengthy, refiners will likely opt to remain running at high rates rather than reduce output or shut down, he said.",

We can push [the gas] through the Turkish Stream. But for now, we have storage facilities, Slovak consumption is secured,\" Fico said at a parliamentary committee meeting.\n\nHe assured that Putin guaranteed that Russia would fulfill its obligations, despite the limited capacity of the TurkStream gas pipeline and the connecting route transporting Russian gas through Turkey to Europe.\n\nSome of the raw materials could be supplied via Western Europe, the Slovak prime minister said. He was referring to pipeline connections between Slovakia and the gas networks of its Central and Western European neighbors.\n\nThe termination of the gas deal between Ukraine and Russia has not caused a fuel shortage in Europe, the publication writes. EU leaders said there was no need to extend the contract, as alternative sources of supply are available to countries that receive Russian gas.\n\nRussian gas supplies to Slovakia\n\nThe agreement between Russia and Ukraine on the export of Russian gas to Europe through Ukrainian territory expired on January 1, 2025. Therefore, Slovakia and other EU countries are starting to look for alternative sources, one of which was Azerbaijan.\n\nRussia said it was ready to continue supplying gas through Ukraine, but because of the war, Ukraine refused to participate in negotiations with Russia on gas exports through its territories.\n\nSlovakian company SPP said it has diversified gas purchase contracts with BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Eni and RWE and has up to 150% of its customers\u02bc consumption available as a safety cushion. SPP said Slovakia has also diversified transit supply routes in case transit via the pipeline through Ukraine is disrupted.\n\nFico threatened to limit aid to Ukraine and stop supplying it with electricity due to the halt in the transit of raw materials.\n\nLater, Slovakia\u02bcs state electricity grid operator SEPS assured that it would continue to supply electricity to Ukraine for emergency assistance needs.\n\nSlovakia and Hungary have also had problems with Russian oil supplies this year.

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nExxon Mobil Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Non-Employee Director Maria Jelescu-Dreyfus made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$109 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$107. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Maria Jelescu-Dreyfus was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.\n\nYou can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNYSE:XOM Insider Trading Volume January 10th 2025\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nDoes Exxon Mobil Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Exxon Mobil insiders own about US$704m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Exxon Mobil Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Exxon Mobil insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Exxon Mobil insiders think the business has merit. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Exxon Mobil. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Exxon Mobil.",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Faces $1.75 Billion Earnings Reduction in Q4 2024\n\nExxon Mobil has revised its financial projections for the fourth quarter of 2024, anticipating a $1.75 billion reduction in earnings. This is largely attributed to weaker refining profits and broader operational challenges. While upstream asset sales contributed approximately $400 million to earnings, impairments of $600 million in other areas offset these gains. Additionally, the company expects refining margins to lower profits by $300-$700 million, while timing effects could lead to a further $500-$900 million decline.\n\nFalling crude oil prices and moderate fuel demand played key roles in Exxon\u2019s financial downturn. However, higher U.S. natural gas prices provided some relief. The chemical division also shows signs of wear, with earnings dropping by $400 million when compared to the previous quarter. The company plans to release its complete financial results on January 31, 2025.\n\nShell Adjusts LNG Production Forecast But Expands Hydrogen Investments\n\nShell has also tempered its financial expectations for Q4 2024. The energy giant forecasts liquefied natural gas (LNG) production to range between 6.8 and 7.2 million metric tons, influenced by reduced feedgas deliveries and fewer cargo shipments. Weaker oil, gas, and chemical trading results due to tepid seasonal demand and expiring hedging contracts further contributed to the outlook. Additionally, Shell expects impairments amounting to $1.5-$3 billion, up to $1.2 billion of which is tied to its renewables division. Despite these challenges, analysts believe there will be minimal impact on shareholder returns, with full-year results expected on January 30, 2025.\n\nHydrogen at the Core of Shell\u2019s Strategy\n\nAmid these financial pressures, Shell continues to prioritize long-term investments in clean energy, notably renewable hydrogen. Its flagship REFHYNE II project in Germany focuses on advancing green hydrogen production on a scalable level. The 100-megawatt electrolyzer, slated for completion in 2027, is expected to produce 44,000 kilograms of renewable hydrogen daily. This project is central to Shell\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon intensity across operations and markets. By integrating electrolysis technology, the energy giant aims to provide emission-free hydrogen for industries and transportation.\n\nShell has allocated between $10 and $15 billion toward low-carbon energy technologies from 2023 to 2025. This portfolio includes contributions to renewable power generation, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and carbon capture initiatives, demonstrating a diversified approach to reducing emissions.\n\nExxon Mobil Pursues the World\u2019s Largest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Facility\n\nExxon Mobil, while facing earnings constraints, underscores its commitment to decarbonization technologies. Central to its strategy is the construction of what is expected to be the world\u2019s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility. Located at the Baytown, Texas complex, the plant aims to generate 1 billion cubic feet of blue hydrogen per day while capturing more than 98% of associated CO2 emissions.\n\nUpdated Article 1/10/25\n\nThe Baytown facility, which includes partnerships such as Air Liquide for feedstock integration, exemplifies Exxon\u2019s forward-looking efforts. The project promises to supply not only Exxon\u2019s industrial hubs but also U.S. Gulf Coast customers aiming to decarbonize their operations. Designed to produce both hydrogen and a million tons of ammonia annually, the facility is projected to begin operations in 2028.\n\nExxon Mobil is already working on hydrogen supply agreements, such as its joint exploration efforts with Japan\u2019s JERA, which would allow for hydrogen and ammonia shipping to international markets. Additionally, successful front-end engineering by Technip Energies provides confidence in the project\u2019s scalability.\n\nConnecting the Financial Outlook with Hydrogen Investments\n\nFor both Exxon Mobil and Shell, falling traditional energy margins reveal compelling reasons to double down on hydrogen-based solutions. While current market conditions spotlight challenges in refining and LNG sectors, hydrogen innovation positions these corporations as key players in the global shift toward clean energy. Expanded hydrogen capabilities could also mitigate investor concerns about declining oil and gas returns by demonstrating a viable path to future growth.\n\nHowever, both companies face hurdles to achieving their hydrogen ambitions. For Shell, delayed profitability in renewable assets raises questions about balancing innovation and shareholder interests. Exxon Mobil, on the other hand, remains reliant on policy support for carbon capture and hydrogen projects. Long-term success will hinge on how effectively these corporations integrate regulatory incentives, demand growth, and infrastructure readiness into their plans.\n\nThe Role of Hydrogen in Transforming Energy Supply Chains\n\nHydrogen represents a bridge to industrial decarbonization, addressing areas like heavy industry, transportation, and high-temperature processes, which are difficult to electrify. By prioritizing projects like Baytown and REFHYNE II, these companies are advancing scalable and practical applications of hydrogen.\n\nCurrently, both blue and green hydrogen technologies offer solutions for reducing carbon emissions. Blue hydrogen, reliant on capturing CO2 during production, provides an immediate pathway to cleaner fuel development. Meanwhile, green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, offers longer-term environmental benefits ideal for growing hydrogen economies in Europe and beyond.\n\nHow These Developments Apply Now\n\nHydrogen technology isn\u2019t just about future milestones\u2014it has applications today. Integrating hydrogen into existing chemical and energy production infrastructure ensures smoother transitions for industrial sectors aiming to lower emissions. Policies encouraging industrial hydrogen adoption could close gaps between supply and demand over the next decade.\n\nFor timelines, Shell\u2019s REFHYNE II is expected to begin commercial operation by 2027, delivering key earnings for further expansions in 2030. Exxon Mobil\u2019s Baytown plant offers one of the industry\u2019s largest carbon capture-enabled hydrogen offerings by 2028, setting a standard for scalability. While these projects won\u2019t solve immediate energy challenges, they provide foundational steps toward a cleaner energy economy.\n\nHydrogen innovation bridges the gap between current fossil-fuel-reliant systems and the sustainable frameworks of tomorrow. From retrofitting industrial plants to fueling cleaner mobility, the time to act on these advancements is now. Encouraging collaboration and policy incentives will ensure that these technologies not only remain viable but thrive in reshaping our global energy landscape.",

As of Jan. 9, 2025, the company had a market capitalization of more than $469 billion with more than 14 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nIt is a major integrated energy company with many energy commodity interests, including electrical power generating operations. At the core of its business is the exploration, production, and distribution of oil and natural gas. In 2023, ExxonMobil earned $36 billion and had net oil-equivalent production of 3.7 million barrels per day. XOM had a dividend yield of 3.70% as of Jan. 9, 2025.\n\nThis is a look at some of Exxon Mobile's top competitors, which include Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell.\n\nKey Takeaways ExxonMobil is the largest and most profitable oil and gas company in the U.S. with domestic and global rivals.\n\nChevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company.\n\nConocoPhillips is a U.S.-based energy exploration and production company.\n\nPreviously known as Royal Dutch Shell, Shell PLC is a London-based energy company that also invests in alternative energy sources.\n\n\n\nChevron Corporation\n\nOriginally headquartered in San Ramon, California, Chevron (CVX) announced a move to Houston, Texas in August 2024. Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company, with a market capitalization of about $267.9 billion and an average daily trading volume of more than seven million shares as of Jan. 9, 2025. The company has integrated petroleum, chemicals, mining, and power generation operations.\n\nChevron had total earnings of $21.3 billion in 2023, and its annual per-share dividend payout has consistently risen each year. The company's average oil-equivalent production was 3.1 million barrels per day. CVX returned $26.3 billion to shareholders in 2023 in the form of $11.3 billion in dividends and $14.9 billion in share repurchases.\n\nConocoPhillips\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) is a Houston-based company that positioned itself as an exploration and production company within the oil and gas industry. The company engages in the worldwide exploration, production, transportation, and marketing of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and liquefied natural gas.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, 2025, the company's market capitalization was $131.45 billion, and its average daily trading volume was 6.57 million shares. At that time, COP paid a dividend yield of 3.07%.\n\nConocoPhillips earned a total of $11 billion in 2023, and it produced over 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. The company also had another 6.8 billion barrels of reserves for the year.\n\nShell PLC\n\nOriginally from the Netherlands and known as Royal Dutch Shell, this company is now based in London and simply goes by Shell (SHEL). The company had a market capitalization of more than $198.7 billion as of Jan. 9, 2025, with more than 4.2 million shares traded in average daily volume.\n\nShell had net earnings of $28 billion in 2023 and ended the year with reserves of nine billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nShell also invests in alternative energy sources. The company has interests in numerous wind energy projects in North America, Europe, and Asia, including multiple in its original home of the Netherlands. It anticipates that its future growth will come from its upstream operations, where technological advances will help the company find new liquid and natural gas reserves. The company also has growth strategies in integrated gas and underwater drilling.\n\nIs ExxonMobil a Downstream or Upstream Company? ExxonMobil is considered an integrated company, which means it has upstream and downstream operations. As part of its upstream operations, the company explores, extracts, and ships raw materials. The majority of its profits are derived from its upstream operations. XOM's downstream operations involve the manufacturing and distribution of crude oil products.\n\nWhat Does Downstream Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry? The term downstream refers to a side of the oil and gas industry that involves converting oil and gas into finished products. Downstream operations results in the production of natural gas, gasoline, and other types of energy sources. Energy companies that are exclusively involved in downstream activities are directly linked to end users. Many companies, though, are involved in downstream, midstream (refining), and upstream (exploration and extraction).\n\nWho Are ExxonMobil's Largest Institutional Shareholders? The largest institutional shareholders of ExxonMobil are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street. They held 432.11 million (9.83% of outstanding shares), 306.81 million (6.98% of outstanding shares), and 221.68 million (5.04% of outstanding shares), respectively. These figures are as of Sept. 30, 2024.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nExxonMobil is a U.S.-based crude oil and natural gas company with operations around the world. Since it has upstream and downstream operations, it explores, produces, transports, manufactures, and sells crude oil and gas products. Although XOM competes with rivals Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell domestically and abroad, it retains the top spot in the United States.",

            "content": "ExxonMobil has filed a lawsuit against California Attorney General Rob Bonta and various non-profit organizations, alleging that criticism of its advanced plastics recycling claims is defamatory.\n\nLast year, the state of California filed an initial lawsuit against ExxonMobil for reported violations of state laws surrounding false advertising, unfair competition, and water pollution. It proclaimed that consumers were deceived into buying more single-use plastic than they otherwise would have done under the impression that it would be safely and easily recycled.\n\nIn reality, prosecutors argued, ExxonMobil\u2019s advanced recycling equipment could only handle limited quantities of waste. 92% of its recycled plastic was said to be used as fuel, with the leftover yield containing very little recyclate.\n\nThe lawsuit added that, even at maximum capacity, ExxonMobil recycles less than 1% of its virgin plastic production capacity \u2013 which, it says, continues to rise.\n\nExxonMobil refuted the allegations. In their view, California officials had been aware of inefficiencies in the state\u2019s recycling system for decades, but had failed to address them and were now attempting to shift the blame.\n\n\u201cInstead of suing us, they could have worked with us to fix the problem and keep plastic out of landfills,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nNevertheless, a coalition of non-profits \u2013 including the Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, Heal the Bay, and San Francisco Baykeeper \u2013 filed its own lawsuit for alleged violations of nuisance and unfair competition laws.\n\n\u201cAs alleged in our complaint, Exxon profited by claiming plastics are safe and recyclable,\u201d said Allison Chin, president of the Sierra Club\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cBut we know better now\u2014our environment and health were being sacrificed just to protect Exxon\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complaint alleges that Exxon has brainwashed everyone into thinking that plastic recycling works and that it\u2019s good for the planet,\u201d added Sejal Choksi-Chugh, executive director of San Francisco Baykeeper. \u201cBut when we pulled back the curtain, we found that Exxon\u2019s plastic polymers are poisoning waterways, wildlife, and people.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco Bay has some of the highest levels of microplastics in the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going after Exxon: to stop plastic pollution at the source.\u201d\n\nNow Reuters reports that ExxonMobil has filed another lawsuit in Texas. Bonta is accused of working with law firm Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, which has connections to the non-profit Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF).\n\nIts founder, Andrew Forrest, is also the founder of the mining company and green solutions competitor Fortescue Metals Group, which has previously criticized ExxonMobil. The lawsuit alleges that IEJF is acting under the direction of Forrest and his environmental foundation, Minderoo Foundation.\n\nIEFJ, Minderoo, and Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy all deny these claims, with the latter writing them off as a \u201cPR campaign\u201d.\n\nHowever, ExxonMobil goes on to argue that the law firm recruited the environmental groups as plaintiffs and contributed to Bonta\u2019s political campaign. Its lawsuit says that \u201cblatant misstatements and attacks on ExxonMobil\u2019s character are targeted at ExxonMobil\u2019s operations in Texas and are actively harming ExxonMobil\u2019s reputation, as well as its contracts with existing and prospective customers.\u201d\n\nIt adds that \u201cadvanced recycling is not a \u2018farce\u2019 or \u2018myth\u2019\u201d, and that \u201cExxonMobil has not engaged in a decades-long secret mission to brainwash or deceive the public.\u201d\n\nExxonMobil has requested undisclosed damages and a retraction of the alleged defamatory statements.\n\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Justice described the move as \u201canother attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception.\u201d\n\nAll the way back in 2023, ClientEarth, Surfrider Foundation Europe, and Zero Waste France announced their intent to take legal action against Danone for allegedly violating legal requirement to disclose and address the environmental impact of its operations. Rosa Pritchard, plastics lawyer at ClientEarth, claimed that the company \u201ccontinue[d] to rely on single-use plastic packaging in the hopes that recycling will miraculously deal with the flood of plastics it puts on the market.\u201d\n\nSymphony Environmental also filed a lawsuit against the European Commission, Parliament, and Council in 2021, alleging that the continent\u2019s ban on oxo-degradable plastic products is not justified by evidence from the European Chemicals Agency and ignores safeguards against arbitrary legislation. The Court of Justice of the European Union subsequently dismissed the action early last year.\n\nRecently, though, the Commission stated that it would take legal action against several Member States for their failure to comply with EU law; this included incorrect labelling for waste sorting purposes and insufficient efforts to keep reusable and recyclable materials out of landfill. This came after every EU Member State is faced an infringement procedure for falling short of collection and recycling targets, among other requirements.\n\nIf you liked this story, you might also enjoy:\n\nThe ultimate guide to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation in 2024\n\nHow are the top brands progressing on packaging sustainability?\n\nSustainable Innovation Report 2024: Current trends and future priorities\n\nEverything you need to know about global plastic sustainability regulation",

The cracker can produce up to 1.8 million metric tons a year of ethylene, according to ExxonMobil-SABIC joint venture Gulf Coast Growth Ventures.\n\nThe pipeline has an initial design capacity of 7.8 million pounds a day, which can be increased to meet growing ethylene demand in south Texas, according to Houston-based EPIC.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increasing HEP\u2019s overall footprint in the Gulf Coast region, the newly acquired ethylene pipeline offers unique synergies with HEP\u2019s existing Javelina Plant, a treating and fractionation plant that extracts olefins, hydrogen, and natural gas liquids from the gas streams produced by local refineries\u201d, HEP said in an online statement Wednesday.\n\nThe transaction was completed last month, EPIC said separately. Neither party disclosed the price.\n\nMike Howard, HEP chair and chief executive said, \u201cThis acquisition aligns with our long-term strategy of building a diversified midstream company through organic growth and acquisitions, anchored by long-term contracts\u201d.\n\nSan Antonio, Texas-based HEP said 2024 was a record year for the company in terms of acquisition transactions, \u201cwith several material transactions totaling more than $1.1 billion\u201d.\n\nHEP now owns and operates over 1,500 miles of pipeline, nearly one billion cubic feet per day of cryogenic processing capacity and almost 2.5 billion barrels of tank storage capacity in the United States and Mexico, according to the company.\n\nEPIC chief executive Brian Freed said, \u201cThe transaction completes the successful development, operation and divestiture of critical midstream infrastructure along the Texas Gulf Coast\u201d.\n\nEarlier Phillips 66 announced a deal to acquire from EPIC natural gas liquids (NGL) pipelines, fractionation facilities and distribution systems in the Permian basin for $2.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThis transaction optimizes our Permian NGL value chain, allows Phillips 66 to provide producers with comprehensive flow assurance, reaching fractionation facilities near Corpus Christi, Sweeny, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, and is expected to deliver attractive returns in excess of our hurdle rates\u201d, Phillips 66 chair and chief executive Mark Lashier said in an online statement Monday.\n\nEPIC\u2019s NGL operations comprise two fractionators with a capacity of170,000 barrels per day (bpd) near Corpus Christi, Texas; purity distribution pipelines stretching about 350 miles; and an NGL pipeline around 885 miles long and with a capacity of 175,000 bpd. The NGL pipeline links the Delaware, Midland and Eagle Ford basins to the fractionation complexes and Phillips 66\u2019s Sweeny Hub.\n\n\u201cEPIC NGL is in the process of increasing its pipeline capacity to 225 MBD [thousand barrels per day] and has sanctioned a second expansion to increase capacity to 350 MBD\u201d, Phillips 66 said.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

            "content": "Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM has projected a sharp decline in its fourth-quarter earnings due to weak performance across all its business segments, including significant headwinds in refining and chemicals. The oil giant's filing with the SEC indicates that quarterly profits could decrease $1.75 billion sequentially, highlighting a challenging environment for the energy sector.\n\nExxonMobil's filing highlighted two critical factors influencing its financial performance \u2014 upstream asset sales contributing approximately $400 million to its results and overall impairments costing around $600 million. However, the company refrained from providing specific reasons behind these impairments.\n\nA key contributor to the profit slump is ExxonMobil's refining segment, where margins are expected to reduce earnings by $300-$700 million. Timing effects related to inventory valuation and other factors are projected to cause an additional loss of $500-$900 million. Weak demand for gasoline and diesel, combined with new refinery operations in Asia and Africa, has created excess supply, exacerbating margin pressures.\n\nIn the United States, refiners maintained high utilization rates, but sluggish demand led to fuel stockpiles. Globally, oil prices declined 6% during the quarter and were down 12% year over year due to demand concerns, adding to ExxonMobil's challenges.\n\nThe company's chemicals business also faced challenges, with reduced margins expected to lower earnings by $400 million from the third-quarter level. On the positive side, U.S. natural gas prices climbed about 30% sequentially, partially offsetting the impact of lower oil prices.\n\nAccording to LSEG estimates, ExxonMobil may report earnings of $1.76 per share for the fourth quarter, implying a significant drop from $2.48 a year ago. RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria described ExxonMobil's earnings outlook as \"well below consensus,\" highlighting significant headwinds for the refining business.\n\nExxonMobil's results, scheduled for release on Jan. 31, will serve as a bellwether for the oil industry, offering insights into the broader challenges faced by energy majors. In the third quarter, ExxonMobil posted $8.6 billion in earnings, but the current forecast signals a stark contrast as the company navigates a tough operating environment.\n\nXOM\u2019s Zacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors interested in the energy sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like TechnipFMC plc FTI, Sunoco LP SUN and Oceaneering International, Inc. OII. While TechnipFMC and Sunoco presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Oceaneering carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Rob Bonta, claiming Bonta falsely accused the company of deceiving the public about the potential for plastic recycling.\n\nThe suit, filed Monday in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas, amounts to a counterpunch against a suit Bonta filed against Exxon Mobil last September accusing the company of greatly exaggerating the extent to which plastics can be recycled by portraying them as universally recyclable.\n\nExxon claims that accusations by Bonta and environmental groups have damaged its reputation with customers.\n\n\u201cWith apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr. Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse greenwashing,\u201d according to the complaint, which also names environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Surfrider Foundation. \u201cWhile posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs and to meaningful innovation,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legal battle underscores a widening rift between California and oil companies. Plastics are a product of the petroleum industry, created by processing chemicals found in hydrocarbons.\n\nBonta\u2018s suit against Exxon goes beyond issues of consumer deception to address plastic manufacturing itself. Plastic waste is increasingly recognized as a serious global pollution problem. The Bonta suit seeks financial penalties \u201cfor the harm inflicted by plastics pollution upon California\u2019s communities and the environment.\u201d\n\nBonta alleged the company \u201cfalsely promoted all plastic as recyclable\u201d while the recycling rate of plastics in the U.S. is below 10%. Exxon has disputed those claims.\n\nThe battle against Big Oil has become a hallmark of the administration of Gov. Gavin Newsom. He\u2019s accused oil companies of price gouging, although state efforts to prove it have thus far born no fruit. Newsom coaxed the state Legislature in two special sessions to create a price gouging investigation unit and to require oil refineries to keep extra stocks of gasoline on hand to prevent price spikes when refineries shut down for maintenance.\n\nThe governor is seeking to keep gasoline prices down as the state increasingly squeezes its oil refineries with its electric vehicle mandate. In 2020, Newsom ruled that automakers increase sales of new zero-emission vehicles over time until 2035, when state policy will ban sale of new traditional gasoline and diesel fueled cars and light trucks.\n\nAt the same time, California is increasing financial penalties on the state\u2019s oil refineries through its Low Carbon Fuel Standards program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Big Oil battle raises questions about future gasoline supply and prices at the pump if more oil companies abandon the state. In October, Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, although it will retain its service stations here. The oil company said market conditions, not recent state policies, drove the decision.",

Here's How\n\nDrawing on a trove of internal industry documents and other evidence, the two initial lawsuits suggested that Exxon and lobbying groups that it belonged to had known for decades that, due to technical and economic limitations, plastics recycling couldn\u2019t manage the waste resulting from rapidly growing plastic production, yet the company promoted it anyway in order to defuse calls for reduced plastic manufacturing.\n\nOne such document quoted an Exxon executive at a 1994 meeting with the American Plastics Council. \u201cWe are committed to the activities\u201d of recycling, the executive said, \u201cbut not committed to the results.\u201d\n\nIn its counter lawsuit, Exxon alleges an untoward financial connection between the environmental groups and an Australian metals mining company called Fortescue, which \u201cis presently competing with Exxon Mobil in the low carbon solutions and energy transition sector.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta in 2022, when he launched an unprecedented investigation into Exxon Mobil and the fossil fuel industry over its alleged role in causing the plastic pollution crisis. Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nAs Exxon describes it, Fortescue funds an Australian environmental organization called the Minderoo Foundation, which allegedly owns a subsidiary called the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund, or IEJF, created in 2022 to support research and litigation \u201caimed at combating the harms of single-use plastic waste.\u201d According to Exxon Mobil, IEJF did not want to sue Exxon in its own name, so it asked the American law firm Cotchett, Pitre, & McCarthy, LLP to \u201crecruit and enlist willing plaintiffs to stand in for the foreign interests\u2019 agenda.\u201d\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\n\nIEJF is the only one of those entities targeted in the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the organization said it is \u201cnot a subsidiary of, owned, or controlled by Minderoo Foundation or Fortescue Metals Group,\u201d and the Minderoo Foundation similarly said Exxon\u2019s complaint refers to its relationship with IEJF \u201cincorrectly.\u201d\n\nAndrew Forrest, the founder of Fortescue, said he was \u201cpersonally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination. The fossil fuel industry is getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on society.\u201d\n\nForrest added that he is \u201cdeeply committed to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels,\u201d and said he would use Fortescue \u2014 which has pledged to decarbonize its operations by 2030 without the use of voluntary carbon offsets \u2014 to that end. \u201cAny accusation of commercial benefit is completely false,\u201d he told Grist.\n\nTyson Redenbarger, an attorney for Cotchett, Pitre, & McCarthy, said the lawsuit is a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the environmental groups\u2019 claims in California. \u201cThe Sierra Club, Surfrider, Heal the Bay, and Baykeeper have been exposing the harmful effects of plastic pollution for decades,\u201d he told Grist. \u201cSuggesting these highly regarded nonprofits are anyone\u2019s \u2018stand in\u2019 is baseless, and fails to recognize that these nonprofits have been at the forefront of the battle over plastics.\u201d\n\nThe main argument in Exxon\u2019s new lawsuit, however, is about Bonta and the environmental groups\u2019 attacks on so-called \u201cadvanced recycling,\u201d also known as chemical recycling. The term refers to a controversial suite of technologies to process plastic trash using high heat and pressure, theoretically turning it back into its constituent polymers so it can be reincorporated into new products again and again.\n\nAccording to its industry proponents, chemical recycling can reprocess plastic that is unrecyclable using conventional methods. But despite decades of research and investment, the technology has not lived up to its promise \u2014 a 2022 report found that fewer than a dozen chemical recycling facilities existed in the U.S., and most were only operating at a \u201cpilot\u201d or \u201cdemonstration\u201d capacity. At least two facilities have closed altogether since then.\n\nIn press releases and public appearances, Bonta and the environmental groups have called Exxon Mobil a \u201cliar\u201d for promoting chemical recycling, and said that chemical recycling is a \u201cmyth\u201d and a \u201csham\u201d \u2014 claims that Exxon Mobil now says were defamatory. To meet the standard for defamation in the U.S., a statement must be false, cause some kind of economic or reputational harm to a person or entity, and have been made negligently or maliciously.\n\nIn an ironic reversal of the arguments leveraged against it, Exxon Mobil claims in its recent lawsuit that Bonta and the environmental groups knew that their criticisms of chemical recycling were false, but they made them anyway \u201cwith reckless disregard for their falsity.\u201d To support this claim, Exxon cites two reports published 21 and 33 years ago, respectively, in which California\u2019s recycling agency and its predecessor noted that chemical recycling \u201cholds significant potential\u201d and \u201cis becoming one of the most attractive recycling technologies for plastic wastes.\u201d\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s lawsuit says that Bonta and the environmental groups\u2019 disparaging comments had \u201cinterfered with contracts and business relationships,\u201d causing \u201ca number of entities to back out of memoranda of understanding for advanced recycling\u201d and resulting in \u201cprospective business arrangements falling through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvanced recycling works,\u201d the suit says, requesting damages and relief, including an injunction that defendants \u201ccease to interfere with Exxon\u2019s prospective advanced recycling contracts.\u201d It also spends three and a half pages highlighting how Bonta and the environmental groups\u2019 claims specifically affect Exxon Mobil\u2019s operations in Texas, making a case for the lawsuit to be heard by federal judges there.\n\nExxon owns one of the United States\u2019 only functioning chemical recycling facilities \u2014 at a chemical plant in Baytown, Texas \u2014 and in November, the company said it would invest $200 million to double that facility\u2019s capacity and add chemical recycling equipment to another facility in Beaumont, Texas. According to a 2023 analysis by the advocacy group Beyond Plastics, Exxon\u2019s existing Baytown facility can process up to 40,000 metric tons of waste plastic per year \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 36 million metric tons of waste generated in the U.S. annually.\n\nRows of plastic material await processing at Exxon Mobil\u2019s Baytown chemical recycling facility, one of only a small handful operating in the U.S. Sergio Flores / AFP via Getty Images\n\nJudith Enck, Beyond Plastics\u2019 president and a former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, said Exxon\u2019s lawsuit was without merit. \u201cThere is consistent data showing that plastics recycling does not achieve a high level of recycling and that chemical recycling is not a real solution to the growing problem of plastic waste,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be so much more productive if Exxon Mobil simply told the truth and refrained from attempting to intimidate elected officials and advocates who are working to actually solve the problem.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Justice shrugged off the lawsuit. \u201cThis is another attempt from Exxon Mobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception,\u201d they said. \u201cThe attorney general is proud to advance his lawsuit against Exxon Mobil and looks forward to vigorously litigating this case in court.\u201d\n\nSurfrider said it was reviewing the lawsuit and declined to comment, and Heal the Bay said it was still preparing a statement. Baykeeper did not respond in time for publication.\n\nThe Sierra Club called the suit \u201ca shameless attempt at intimidation.\u201d \u201cExxon is clearly confused about the difference between defamation and accountability,\u201d Jonathan Berman, the organization\u2019s deputy chief of communications, told Grist. \u201cThe Sierra Club will not sit back as Exxon Mobil attempts to use their billions to bully those standing up for the health of working families.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated.",

            "content": "It hasn't been the best quarter for Exxon Mobil Corporation ( ) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 12% in that time. But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. To wit, the share price did better than an index fund, climbing 57% during that period.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nExxon Mobil became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Exxon Mobil's TSR for the last 3 years was 75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nExxon Mobil provided a TSR of 10% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 14% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

(AMGN), as well as two micro-cap stocks: PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. (PNRG) and FONAR Corp. (FONR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nShares of Microsoft have gained +13.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s gain of +17.6%. The company is riding on robust Azure and Office 365 performance, amplified by surging AI Copilot adoption. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 60,000 customers holds promise.\n\n\n\nIntelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, is encouraging. We expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 12.8% from fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings is an headwind. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain concerns.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\n\n\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+10.5% vs. +5.2%). The company\u2019s high-value assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana drive robust production growth, doubling upstream earnings since 2019. The Pioneer acquisition and Guyana ramp-up have enhanced profitability, while $11 billion in structural savings since 2019 (targeting $15 billion by 2027) strengthen resilience.\n\n\n\nWith a low net debt-to-capital ratio, XOM supports steady cash flows, dividends, buybacks and investments in high-return projects. Expansion in low-carbon tech, including Baytown's hydrogen facility, positions it for future growth.\n\n\n\nYet, refining margins are pressured due to global capacity increases, with crack spreads softening. Regulatory hurdles in California and XOM\u2019s reliance on finding recoverable reserves add risk. Commodity price volatility challenges profitability, especially as crude prices dipped in the third quarter.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Amgen have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (-14.9% vs. -5.9%). The company\u2019s increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Amgen\u2019s old medicines like Evenity, Repatha and Prolia, as well as newer medicines like Tavneos and Tezspire, are driving sales, offsetting declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel.\n\n\n\nThe addition of Horizon products is boosting revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which have a large market opportunity. Key obesity candidate MariTide demonstrated sustainable weight loss in a phase II study.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\n\n\n\nPrimeEnergy Resources\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - U.S. industry over the past year (+106.4% vs. +14.0%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $363.25 million showcases robust financial performance, with revenues surging 84% year over year to $177.27 million for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2024, driven by higher production volumes and improved pricing.\n\n\n\nOil production skyrocketed 131%, natural gas 82% and NGLs 112%, reflecting strategic investments in horizontal drilling. With a low debt-to-capitalization ratio of 1.75% and long-term debt at just $3 million, PrimeEnergy maintains financial discipline while benefiting from a $115 million borrowing base.\n\n\n\nStrategic acquisitions in West Texas and divestitures of non-core assets enhance focus on high-yield projects. Positioned to capitalize on rising global energy demand and favorable market conditions, PrimeEnergy combines operational efficiency, a strong asset base, and market alignment to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy Resources here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of FONAR have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (-21.1% vs. +10.1%).

            "content": "Rob Bonta, attorney general of California, during an interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Bonta last month in an interview said the state was in touch with the US Justice Department about the potential Apple Inc. antitrust case and could join onto an eventual complaint. Photographer: Loren Elliott/Bloomberg\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. filed a lawsuit alleging that California Attorney General Rob Bonta and several environmental groups made defamatory comments about the oil company\u2019s ability to recycle plastic.\n\nExxon accused Bonta, the Sierra Group and others of making \u201cfalse accusations\u201d about its advanced recycling process. Exxon said in a suit filed in federal court in Texas Monday that the process works and the claims have damaged its relationship with customers.\n\n\u201cWith apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr. Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse greenwashing,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cWhile posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs and to meaningful innovation.\u201d\n\nBonta, a Democrat, sued Exxon on behalf of California in September over claims of public nuisance, water pollution and misleading environmental marketing. In a statement at the time, Bonta alleged the company \u201cfalsely promoted all plastic as recyclable\u201d when in fact the US recycling rate has never exceeded 9%. Exxon and other manufacturers are also facing plastics recycling suits by a Kansas county and by residents in four states.\n\nIn recent months, Exxon has shown a willingness to use the courts to defend its reputation and legal rights when attacked by critics, especially those focused on the environment. Last year, the company sued two of its own investors to remove environmental proposals from the ballot at its annual meeting.\n\nExxon sought to continue the suit even after the proposals were withdrawn, claiming to be a \u201cforceful advocate\u201d for shareholder rights, but the case was eventually dismissed.\n\nThe company claims Bonta made the anti-Exxon statements in a \u201cdeliberate smear campaign\u201d in his \u201cpersonal capacity to drive up donations and publicity for his political campaign.\u201d It also accuses one of the defendants, the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund Ltd., of serving \u201cprivate foreign interests\u201d through its relationship with Perth-based Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.\n\nBonta\u2019s office said the suit is \u201canother attempt from Exxon Mobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception\u201d and that the attorney general \u201clooks forward to vigorously litigating this case in court.\u201d\n\nIn its own statement, the the Australia-registered non-profit organization Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund said it\u2019s not controlled by Fortescue and its activities in California were to \u201ctake action on the issue of plastic waste.\u201d\n\nFortescue, which is not named as a defendant, rejected Exxon\u2019s assertions in the suit, including the claim it orchestrated litigation to gain a competitive advantage in the low-carbon energy space. The Australian miner is \u201cfully committed\u201d to green hydrogen, a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe Sierra Club said the suit is \u201ca shameless attempt at intimidation by a multibillion dollar polluter corporation that covered up its climate change denial for decades.\u201d\n\nThe Sierra Club has received funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable organization founded by Michael Bloomberg, who is the majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\n\nThe case is Exxon Mobil Corporation v. Bonta, 25-cv-00011, US District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Beaumont).\n\n(Updates with Sierra Club comment in 11th paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

The ban will cover the entire East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the coast off of California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as a large part of Alaska.\n\nThe ban prevents companies from leasing new drilling along 625 million acres, which Ron Neal, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America Offshore Committee, said would limit the industry\u2019s exploration of new projects, hurting its ability to survive in the long term.\n\nIn his announcement of the ban, Biden explained that he made the decision because \u201cdrilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation\u2019s energy needs.\u201d Trump has called the ban \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nWon\u2019t Trump just reverse it? Trump won the election promising to drop gas prices by reversing Biden\u2019s environmental policies, increasing drilling, eliminating regulations, and supercharging America\u2019s fossil fuel industry.\n\nBut he might not be able to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d so fast. Biden has passed the protections without an expiration date and has the authority to withdraw areas from drilling under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953. Back in 2017, Trump tried to reverse waters that had been protected under the Obama administration but was told by the courts that the act was irreversible by succeeding presidents.\n\nStill, the ban could be reversed in other ways. An act of the Republican-controlled Congress could do the trick. Trump is also likely to challenge it despite the precedent, a decision that would spur a legal battle that would likely be decided by the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority hasn\u2019t shied away from overturning environmental protections in recent terms.",

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Exxon Mobil's ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exxon Mobil is:\n\n13% = US$35b \u00f7 US$276b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Exxon Mobil's Earnings Growth And 13% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Exxon Mobil seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. This probably goes some way in explaining Exxon Mobil's significant 36% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Exxon Mobil's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 40% in the same 5-year period.\n\nNYSE:XOM Past Earnings Growth January 6th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is XOM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.",

This means the outlook for energy company earnings is likely too low and that an outperformance/upgrade cycle is about to unfold. Based on the consensus figures for energy sector earnings, the rebound in sentiment and stock prices could be vigorous.\n\nThe early-January consensus of 3.5% is down 650 basis points from the peak in mid-2024, making the Energy Sector NYSEARCA: XLE the weakest regarding 2025 earnings growth and the most downgraded sector in the S&P 500.\n\nGet Exxon Mobil alerts: Sign Up\n\nThe Forecast for Oil Prices in 2025 Is Too Low\n\nThe latest forecasts have a WTI average in the low-$70s and as low as $69 for the year. The latest price action in WTI has the spot price moving higher, confirming the price floor in place since 2021. That floor is in the $69 to $72 range; oil prices will have to move lower to reach that level, and the odds are decreasing that it will.\n\nGDP growth is solid and expected to remain solid, and there are tailwinds in the form of administrative policy and economic stimulus that will lead to better-than-forecast results, all supportive of oil prices. U.S. GDP is expected to hold steady at a moderate 2.5% in 2025, while globally, GDP will accelerate to roughly 3.5% and possibly as high as 4%, led by the emerging markets.\n\nThe tailwinds of Trump's administrative policy and economic stimulus in China will also support the energy demand. China adopted numerous policies intended to spur growth late in 2024, including plans for increased bond funding and wage increases for many of its workers. The bond funding will be used for long-term equipment upgrades and capital improvement, while increased wages will boost consumption, which is good news for oil prices.\n\nRegarding Trump\u2019s policies, the demand boost will be offset by increasing production, but it will be sufficient in this scenario to keep the price floor in place.\n\nRegarding OPEC, the cartel is unlikely to increase its production in 2025 and will likely keep production restraints in place to benefit from higher prices. It, too, is set up for an upgrade cycle after lowering its demand outlook for 2025 at the end of last year.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation Is the Leading Play in Diversified Energy\n\nExxon Mobil Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$129.25\n\n19.04% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 22 Analyst Ratings Current Price $108.58 High Forecast $147.00 Average Forecast $129.25 Low Forecast $105.00 Exxon Mobil Stock Forecast Details\n\nExxon Mobil NYSE: XOM is the leading player among diversified energy companies and the largest integrated energy company outside China; it is also a high-yield stock trading at a deep discount to the S&P 500 NYSEARCA: SPY. It is forecasted to produce a revenue decline in 2025 but to widen the margin, which is critical to the capital return outlook. Not only is Exxon\u2019s revenue forecast likely too low, setting it up to outperform in 2025, but its robust capital return is safe.\n\nExxon stock yields more than 3.6%, with share prices near $105. The payment is less than 50% of the 2025 earnings outlook, growing annually at a low-single-digit CAGR and compounded by share repurchases. The share count is up at the end of FQ3 2024 because of the all-stock acquisition of Pioneer but falling every quarter, and buyback activity is ramping higher. Buybacks in Q3 topped $13.8 billion, up 5.7% from the last year, and are expected to remain strong in calendar 2025.\n\nExxon stock is trending higher despite the lack of traction in 2023 and 2024. The uptrend is marked by price dips in mid-2022, early 2024, and early 2025, which show rising support among long-term investors. That support is echoed in the analysts' sentiment data, which shows a moderate conviction in the Moderate Buy rating and $128.74 price target.\n\nThe consensus reported by MarketBeat is down marginally over the past few months, but most targets issued in December 2024 range from $120 to $140, offering a 12% to 30% upside for investors. A move to $120 aligns with recent highs and puts this market in a position to hit new highs.\n\nBefore you consider Exxon Mobil, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

            "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS released final rules Jan. 3 for a hydrogen production tax credit that enables producers to use electricity from various sources, including natural gas with carbon capture.\n\nHydrogen made from renewable natural gas (RNG) and coal mine methane are also eligible for the 45V credit, Treasury said. The rules additionally provide more leeway for the use of nuclear power to produce hydrogen.\n\n\u201cWith the inclusion of these changes, the final rules provide clarity, investment certainty and flexibility, including for participants in projects planned as part of the Department of Energy\u2019s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program,\u201d the department said in announcing its final rules.\n\nThe rules come as the Biden administration heads to the exits on Jan. 20\u2014and roughly a year after the department and the IRS first released proposed rules for the 45V credit offered in the Inflation Reduction Act. The lack of final regulations has created uncertainty among producers reliant on incentives to make projects economically viable.\n\nMajors, including Exxon Mobil, have said the 45V tax credit policy would help determine the company\u2019s plans to produce up to 1 Bcf/d of hydrogen using Permian Basin natural gas as a feedstock. But a final investment decision on the project in 2025 would be subject to \u201ctranslation of the IRA 45V policy into actionable technology,\u201d company officials said.\n\nDustin Meyer, American Petroleum Institute senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs, said clear and consistent policy is essential for building a lower-carbon hydrogen industry and strengthening America's energy leadership.\n\n\u201cTreasury's 45V guidance marks a meaningful step forward, encouraging innovation while driving progress on emissions,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThis framework offers an opportunity for natural gas, when paired with carbon capture and storage, to compete more fairly in new markets and meet growing demand for affordable, reliable, lower-carbon energy. We look forward to collaborating with the incoming administration to uphold technology-neutral hydrogen policies that position the U.S. as a global leader in innovation.\u201d\n\nThe new rules create pathways for hydrogen produced using both electricity and methane, providing investment certainty while ensuring that clean hydrogen production meets the law\u2019s lifecycle emissions standards, the department said.\n\n\u201cBy law, the tax credit\u2019s value is based on the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of hydrogen production. To qualify as clean hydrogen under the statute, the lifecycle GHG emissions of the hydrogen production process must be no greater than 4 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO 2 e) per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Qualifying clean hydrogen falls into four credit tiers, with hydrogen produced with the lowest GHG emissions receiving the largest credit.\u201d\n\nThe amount of the clean hydrogen production credit for any taxable year is $0.12, $0.15, $0.20 or $0.60 per kg of qualified clean hydrogen produced, depending on the lifecycle GHG emissions rate associated with the facility's hydrogen production process, according to the final rules. To qualify for the full credit, projects must also meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards, which effectively multiply the credits by five.\n\nThe final regulations also provide rules for determining the eligibility of so-called blue hydrogen using methane reforming technologies, including with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).\n\n\u201cThe final rules aim to enhance the accuracy of upstream methane leakage rates used in determining the credit value,\u201d the department said.\n\nThe rules also reverse initial guidance on using nuclear power, said Durgesh Chopra, an analyst at Evercore ISI, in a Jan. 3 commentary.\n\n\u201cImportantly, the final rules announced provide incremental clarity and flexibility that should help facilitate investments within clean hydrogen that have been largely put on pause,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cThe final rules differ from the proposed rules in several respects, however arguably the two most meaningful changes relate to instrumentality and time-matching.\u201d\n\nThe rules provide additional pathways for demonstrating instrumentality including nuclear retirement risk, states policies and new CCS.\n\n\u201cAs it pertains to nuclear, electricity produced by nuclear plants meeting certain bright-line indications of retirement risk and certain indications of co-dependence on hydrogen investment will be considered incremental up to 200MW per qualifying reactor, which reverses the proposed rules which prohibited existing nuclear plants from qualifying,\u201d Chopra said.\n\nRELATED\n\nUS Hydrogen Concerns Linger as Next Administration Nears White House",

He said that Ali and Jagdeo condemned the Agreement\u2019s terms as unconscionable and built expectations of better royalty rates, explicitly introducing ring-fencing provisions and removing the tax arrangements requiring Guyana to pay ExxonMobil\u2019s taxes.\n\n\u201cWhen in power, that commitment conveniently evaporated. First, President Ali and VP Jagdeo converted to a new religion \u2013 the sanctity of contract, which they embraced for nearly four years. As that faith was exposed as false religions do, they now claim that they have kept their promise and passed a new Petroleum Activities Act. Guyanese know the meaning of `renegotiate\u2019 and that the new Act does not affect pre-existing Agreements.\n\n\u201cVP and oil czar Jagdeo struggles to rewrite his bold statements about renegotiation and now engages in all kinds of prevarication. When in opposition, he specifically cited the discovery of 3 billion barrels in the Stabroek Block as justification for renegotiating the 2016 Agreement. Now, with discoveries exceeding 11 billion barrels, he claims his words meant something entirely different. Guyanese may be naive and even gullible, polite and non-confrontational, but stupid. No. They know what they saw with their own eyes and heard with their own ears. They know how to distinguish equivocation and obfuscation from what they saw and heard\u201d, Ram declared.\n\nBy his refusal to establish an independent Petroleum Commission, Ram charged that the President has ceded to the Vice President exclusive and unquestioned authority over all decisions concerning the petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, his once imaginative and insightful motto of One Guyana is fast evolving into EXX-ONe GUYANA\u201d, Ram asserted.\n\nHe said that the pattern of betrayal goes beyond mere policy reversal.\n\n\u201cThe government has become ExxonMobil\u2019s most reliable defender, ignoring or dismissing those who dare question the company\u2019s incorrect accounting, made-up cost recovery claims and unsupervised operations. They resist meaningful environmental oversight and delay promised sector reforms, including establishing a Petroleum Commission, again publicly committed to by Ali and Jagdeo, or holding a Commission of Inquiry into the Agreement\u2019s negotiation\u201d despite former Minister Raphael Trotman\u2019s willingness to testify, he said.\n\nHe added that their resistance to investigation suggests they fear what might be revealed about the previous administration\u2019s actions and perhaps their own role in maintaining these arrangements. He pointed out that in his book `From Destiny to Prosperity,\u2019 Trotman, then Natural Resources Minister, had said that Jagdeo, as Leader of the Opposition, had secretly agreed with the APNU + AFC Government not to oppose the Legislative Order granting the ultra-generous tax measures in the 2016 Agreement.\n\nRam then turned his sights on the opposition.\n\n\u201cAnd where does the current Opposition fit into all of this? The APNU+AFC coalition\u2019s failure to hold the government accountable compounds this betrayal of trust. Having been part of the government that signed the original agreement, it now appears paralysed by its role. Opposition Leader Aubrey Norton\u2019s lack of knowledge and interest in this crucial issue is extremely disturbing. His failure to articulate any coherent position on renegotiation, inability to effectively challenge the government\u2019s reversals, and apparent disinterest in the technical details of oil governance suggest a profound lack of understanding or a deliberate abdication of responsibility\u201d, Ram posited.\n\nThe chartered accountant and lawyer lamented that the surrender of parliamentary sovereignty through the stability clause until 2057 represents a constitutional crisis unprecedented in resource agreements globally.\n\n\u201cOur founding fathers fought for permanent sovereignty over our natural resources and parliamentary supremacy. Their successors have traded both for a mess of pottage\u201d, Ram thundered.\n\nHe said that elections 2025 offers the people the opportunity to respond.\n\n\u201cWill they support any political party that sells out their birthright? Or will they reject them for any party committed to renegotiation? The year 2025 will provide the answer\u201d, he said.",

Mainly related to carbon dioxide capture, storage and utilization Investing in carbon capture with IRA law tax credit \"Trump's IRA Act Will Be Hard to Abolish\" Analysis\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 The oil depot of Occidental Petrolium.\n\nThis year, the global financial investment industry, including Wall Street, is paying keen attention to the policy direction of the second Donald Trump administration.\n\nAccording to the financial investment industry on the 5th, the Trump administration has put forward its vision to drastically reduce electricity prices by promoting fossil fuel production as a key policy, but paradoxically, analysts say it will be the first year when the eco-friendly technology \"carbon capture\" will be expanded in earnest.\n\nCCUS is a technology that captures and stores (CCS) or utilizes (CCU) carbon dioxide emitted in the process of using fossil fuels.\n\nAmong CCUS technologies, a direct atmospheric capture (DAC) project that uses chemicals that combine with carbon after turning a huge fan to suck up air in the atmosphere has recently attracted attention.\n\nAmong the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, global oil and natural gas companies such as ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, and Shell are emerging as representative beneficiaries of carbon capture policies.\n\nHana Securities analyzed, \"The growth potential of carbon capture (CCS) in the Trump 2.0 era is highly likely to be highlighted,\" adding, \"EOR (oil promotion recovery) using carbon dioxide from oil fields is essential for expanding crude oil and gas production, which is Trump's core policy, because carbon dioxide available in the United States is absolutely insufficient.\"\n\nThrough the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which took effect last year, the U.S. has strengthened support such as tax credits for related projects such as the installation of CCUS facilities. For CCS, we offer an incentive of $85 per ton of carbon.\n\nOil companies such as Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum, and Chevron have been investing in hydrogen and carbon capture technologies using $370 billion in eco-friendly tax credits supported by the IRA law.\n\nA case in point is ExxonMobil's attempt to apply a technology that can capture more than 90% of carbon dioxide to large-scale natural gas-fired power plants designed to directly supply electricity to data centers.\n\nChevron New Energy, Chevron's eco-friendly energy subsidiary, has also been discussing ways to build a natural gas-fired power plant equipped with carbon capture technology for more than a year.\n\nMoreover, these companies are already actively using the CCS method of injecting carbon into oil fields to expand oil production.\n\nDespite criticism of using eco-friendly technologies to expand oil production capacity, it is difficult for Trump to discard the IRA law that supports carbon capture, given that it will ultimately help lower electricity prices in the United States.\n\nVicky Holov, CEO of Occidental Petroleum, also said, \"Trump's return to power is very positive for the oil and gas business and is particularly optimistic about the DAC project, a type of CCS.\"\n\nThe fact that Elon Musk, Trump's closest aide, is a CCUS admirer also raises expectations for the carbon capture market.\n\nElon Musk recently held a $100 million carbon removal competition with the XPRIZE Foundation.\n\n\"Instead of rapidly changing the existing industrial structure, practical and scalable technologies are important,\" Musk said, pointing out that CCUS technology is a realistic way to reduce carbon dioxide while coexisting with the fossil fuel industry.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Multiple factors, including forecasts for an extremely cold winter and rising natural gas prices, are driving a surge in diesel prices. The Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration (DOE/EIA) reported a $0.027 increase in the average retail diesel price, reaching $3.503 a gallon to close out 2024. This jump coincides with a rise in ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures, which climbed $0.055 a gallon to settle at $2.2995, marking a 2.44% gain and the highest settlement since November 5th.\n\nNatural gas prices have also dramatically increased, with the price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) rising almost 152% since March 26th. These price movements have significant implications for the transportation sector and the broader economy. As winter approaches and the demand for heating fuels increases, two companies are well-positioned to benefit from the rising tide of diesel prices.\n\nWhy Diesel Prices Matter to Investors\n\nDiesel's role extends far beyond fueling trucks and heavy machinery. It is a critical component of the transportation, agricultural, and industrial sectors. Fluctuations in its price ripple throughout the economy. When diesel prices rise, transportation costs increase for businesses, impacting everything from shipping goods to operating farm equipment. These increased costs are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. For investors, understanding the dynamics of the diesel market is crucial, especially during periods of significant price movement.\n\nThe current surge in diesel prices is particularly noteworthy given the relatively low U.S. inventories of non-jet distillates. As of December 20, 2024, these inventories stood at 116.5 million barrels, considerably lower than the five-year average (excluding 2020) of 125.4 million barrels. This combination of rising demand, driven by cold weather forecasts, and relatively low supply creates a favorable environment for energy companies.\n\nHigher demand for diesel translates to increased revenue and profitability for those involved in its production, refining, and distribution. Furthermore, the market is anticipating economic data releases, including China's PMI factory surveys and the U.S. ISM survey, which could provide further insights into global oil demand. These factors, combined with the potential for increased diesel demand as a substitute for natural gas in heating, create a compelling investment case for stocks in the energy sector.\n\nChevron: A Prudent Investment in the Energy Sector\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is the second-largest integrated oil company in the United States and is a prime example of a company poised to benefit from the current market conditions. With a market capitalization of around $265 billion and operations spanning the globe, Chevron's diversified business model encompasses upstream and downstream segments. This vertical integration allows the company to capture value across the entire energy supply chain, from exploration and production to refining and marketing.\n\nChevron is a Dividend Aristocrat with 37 years of consecutive dividend growth. The company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. This announcement follows a strong third-quarter 2024 performance, with Chevron reporting earnings of $4.5 billion and a record cash flow from operations of $9.7 billion. These positive results, combined with a strong balance sheet, highlight Chevron's financial strength and its ability to provide investors with both capital appreciation and a steady income stream, with a current dividend yield of 4.40%.\n\nChevron is focused on streamlining its operations and reducing costs. The company is targeting $2-3 billion of structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. Part of this initiative includes a planned restructuring charge of $0.7 to $0.9 billion after-tax in the fourth quarter of 2024. While these charges represent a short-term expense, they are expected to contribute to improved efficiency and profitability in the long run. Chevron is also actively optimizing its portfolio, as evidenced by the announced $6.5 billion sale of its Canadian assets.\n\nExxonMobil: A Global Energy Leader\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) is also one of the world's largest publicly traded international energy and petrochemical companies. The company creates another compelling investment opportunity in the current market environment. With a market capitalization of around $475 billion and operations spanning the globe, ExxonMobil is a major player in all aspects of the energy industry. Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (Q3 FY2024) revealed earnings of $8.6 billion, or $1.92 per share, demonstrating its continued financial strength. The company announced that it had achieved a record liquids production of 3.2 million barrels per day.\n\nLike Chevron, ExxonMobil is a Dividend Aristocrat, boasting 42 consecutive years of dividend increases. The company declared a fourth-quarter dividend of $0.99 per share, a rise of 4%. The current dividend yield of 3.66% provides investors with a reliable income stream. ExxonMobil is committed to returning value to shareholders and has a stated goal to repurchase over $19 billion of shares in 2024. ExxonMobil has demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders through consistent dividend growth and share repurchases, further enhancing its appeal to investors.\n\nExxonMobil is focused on optimizing its operations and achieving structural cost savings. The company has already achieved $11.3 billion of cumulative structural cost savings and is on track to deliver a total of $15 billion in savings by the end of 2027. In 2025, the company will continue to prioritize high-return, low-cost-of-supply investments, with cash capital expenditures expected to be between $27 and $29 billion.\n\nA Strategic Winter Investment\n\nThe current surge in diesel prices is being driven by a combination of seasonal demand and supply constraints, presenting a compelling investment opportunity in energy stocks. Chevron and ExxonMobil, with their strong financial positions, diversified operations, and commitment to dividend growth, are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this trend. As winter approaches and the demand for heating fuels intensifies, these companies are poised to see increased revenue and profitability.\n\nChevron and ExxonMobil present attractive investment opportunities for those looking to benefit from the predicted winter price increase. Both companies provide a balance of income and growth potential with strategies that position them for continued success in the changing energy landscape. Their commitment to long-term value and investments in lower-carbon technologies make them suitable options for beginner to intermediate investors navigating the dynamic energy market. Adding these stocks to portfolios before the winter price surge could be a strategic move for potential profit.\n\nThe article \"Cold Front, Hot Stocks: Diesel Prices Propel Energy Leaders\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

These top tech titans currently dominate the tech market, driven by the rapid growth in AI. However, there are many smaller players that have had much less time in the spotlight.\n\nOne such great AI stock is C3.ai AI, which specializes in enterprise AI solutions for a variety of industries, including energy, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, and defense. The company\u2019s flagship offering is the C3 AI Suite, a comprehensive platform that enables organizations to develop, deploy, and scale AI applications.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $4.5 billion, C3.ai is expanding its customer base, refining its operating model, and capitalizing on the AI boom. While the company is not yet profitable, its revenue growth, strong partnerships, and strategic efforts may soon reverse its fortunes.\n\nWhile the stock has gained 19.8% in 2024, trailing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s SPX 24% gain, Wall Street expects an uptick of 61% this year. Let\u2019s find out if C3.ai is a good AI investment for the long term.\n\nC3.ai Reported an Impressive Quarter\n\nC3.ai once again exceeded expectations with its impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results, which mark the company\u2019s seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. The company reported a notable 22% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue, resulting in a 29% increase in total revenue to $94.3 million, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by $3.32 million.\n\nThis strong financial performance highlights C3.ai\u2019s continued expansion of its customer base, partnerships, and demand for its innovative AI solutions across multiple industries. The subscription-based business model, which accounted for 86% of total revenue, provides a more consistent and recurring income stream.\n\nA growing network of high-profile partners, including Google GOOGL, Capgemini, Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Exxon Mobil XOM, among others, drove the second-quarter performance.\n\nC3.ai Is on a Path to Profitability\n\nAlthough C3.ai has not yet achieved profitability, its financial outlook is promising. The company reported a significant improvement in its adjusted operating loss and a decrease in adjusted net loss per share, indicating a positive trend. Adjusted net loss came in at $0.06 per share, compared to $0.13 per share in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDespite its rapid expansion, the company has kept a strong, debt-free balance sheet. This distinguishes it from many peers in the technology sector that often accumulate excessive debt during their pre-profit stages, particularly as AI requires significant investment. At the end of Q2, C3.ai had about $730.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, indicating ample liquidity to fund future AI growth initiatives.\n\nThe company had a negative free cash flow of $39.5 million. However, C3.ai expects to have positive free cash flow by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2025.\n\nCEO Tom Siebel emphasized that the company\u2019s expanding network of partnerships, particularly with Microsoft, is a key driver of its growth. The company expanded its strategic agreement with Microsoft, which is expected to last until March 2030, giving C3.ai access to Microsoft\u2019s extensive sales channels while significantly shortening sales cycles.\n\nThis partnership could allow the company to leverage Microsoft\u2019s global reach and resources, propelling it toward profitability.\n\nMoreover, C3.ai\u2019s involvement in defense and public sector projects, including contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, highlights its ability to secure large, long-term agreements in critical sectors.\n\nBeyond its strategic partnerships, C3.ai\u2019s market position is bolstered by a strong patent portfolio. The company has made significant progress in generative and agentic AI, acquiring valuable patents that position it as a leader in the next wave of AI technology.\n\nC3.ai raised its fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $378 million to $398 million, a potential growth of 21% to 28% year on year. The company remains committed to expanding its operations while carefully managing costs to achieve profitability.\n\nAnalysts predict 25% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, followed by 22.3% in fiscal 2026. Analysts forecast losses of around $0.62 in fiscal 2025 and $0.51 in fiscal 2026. C3.ai, trading at nine times forward 2026 sales, appears to be a reasonable buy right now.\n\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About C3.ai Stock?\n\nOverall, on Wall Street, analysts have a mixed opinion about C3.ai stock, rating it a \u201cHold.\u201d Out of the 14 analysts covering the stock, four rate it a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d four rate it a \u201cHold,\u201d two rate it a \u201cModerate Sell,\u201d and four rate it a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d The stock is trading close to its mean target price of $36.15. However, its high price estimate of $56 implies the stock could rally 61.5% over the next 12 months.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nC3.ais\u2019 revenue growth trajectory and groundbreaking partnership with Microsoft position the company for significant growth in the coming years. The partnership with Microsoft will enable C3.ai to scale its sales efforts, shorten sales cycles, and reach a global customer base. However, the AI market is highly competitive, and risks remain.\n\nWith a solid balance sheet, high-profile partners, a growing intellectual property portfolio, and a clear path to profitability, C3.ai is an appealing investment opportunity in the rapidly expanding enterprise AI market. For investors looking to profit from the AI revolution and who can stomach the risks, C3.ai is a name to keep an eye on in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Natural gas prices recently jumped 20% in a single day. That's a pretty shocking move but, frankly, not all that unusual when it comes to energy prices. If you are looking at the broader energy sector and trying to figure out which stock to buy as 2025 gets underway, your best option is probably going to be an integrated energy giant like ExxonMobil (XOM -0.42%) or Chevron (CVX 0.62%).\n\nHere's how these two U.S. energy giants stack up and why you might want to pick Chevron.\n\nThe benefits of integration\n\nAs the natural gas example above highlights, energy prices are highly volatile. That often leads to massive swings in the prices of energy producers. Energy producers live in the upstream segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nThere are, however, two other segments, the midstream and downstream. Midstream companies own things like pipelines and collect fees from companies that use these assets to transport energy commodities. It is a relatively stable segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nMeanwhile, downstream companies use oil and natural gas to produce chemicals and other refined products. Downstream companies often benefit from lower energy prices, though it is important to note that chemicals and refined products are often commodity products themselves subject to their own, sometimes volatile, price dynamics.\n\nIntegrated energy companies like Exxon and Chevron have exposure to all three segments of the broader energy industry. Although oil and natural gas prices are still the driving force behind financial results, having exposure to the midstream and downstream helps to soften the peaks and valleys.\n\nFor most investors, going with an integrated energy company will be the best choice. And sticking to the industry giants, a list that includes Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies, will probably be the best individual option. In this regard, Exxon and Chevron are interchangeable with any of the others on the list.\n\nDividends that keep going up\n\nThat said, Exxon and Chevron stand out in a very important way. They have both increased their dividends annually for decades. BP and Shell cut their dividends during the early days of the pandemic in 2020. TotalEnergies didn't cut its dividend at that point, but it just doesn't have the same track record of regular dividend growth that Exxon and Chevron have. Exxon and Chevron have shown a material dedication to investors and that quickly winnows down the choice from five to two.\n\nBut Exxon's streak of annual dividend increases is better. The energy giant has hiked its dividend for 42 consecutive years. Chevron's streak is \"just\" 37 years long. Clearly, this is something of a fine distinction, since both are very impressive dividend streaks. However, Exxon still gets the edge, even if it is only a slight advantage.\n\nA higher yield with Chevron\n\nThe other side of the dividend, however, is the dividend yield. On this front, Chevron wins hands down with a 4.5% yield. Exxon's yield is a lower 3.7%. That may not seem like a huge difference on an absolute basis, but percentage wise Chevron's yield is 20% higher. That's a very big difference that will likely be of interest to income-focused investors.\n\nThat outcome, however, has to be juxtaposed against the risk of a dividend cut. Because energy prices, and thus earnings, are so volatile, the dividend payout ratio isn't a great indication of dividend sustainability in the energy sector. You have to focus on a mix of the company's commitment to the dividend (which is good for both Chevron and Exxon) and financial strength. In this case, Chevron and Exxon have similarly low debt-to-equity ratios, suggesting that their leverage is modest.\n\nIn fact, this is part of the long-term plan, as both add debt during industry downturns so they can continue to fund their businesses and dividends. When energy prices recover, as they always have historically, the companies pay down the debt they took on. Although you wouldn't be taking on massive risk with Exxon, the added yield from Chevron still wins out here from a risk/reward basis.\n\nTemporary headwinds at Chevron\n\nThe next question to ask when comparing Chevron and Exxon is why there is a dividend yield discrepancy. The answer is pretty simple -- Exxon is performing better right now on some key industry metrics, including return on capital employed. Chevron is also in the middle of buying Hess, but the deal is being held up because of business relationships Hess has with other companies, including Exxon. Investors are clearly worried that Chevron just isn't hitting on all cylinders right now.\n\nThat is a legitimate concern and, perhaps, it is appropriate that Chevron's yield is higher. However, if you think in decades and not days this could also be an opportunity. Given Chevron's long and successful history, financial strength, and diversified business model, it seems highly likely that it will eventually muddle through this patch of weakness. And even if the Hess deal falls apart, the $250 billion market cap company is large enough and financially strong enough to simply find another acquisition candidate if it wants to.\n\nAll in, Chevron is trailing behind Exxon today. But investors are getting paid for the added risk this poses via the higher dividend yield. That will probably be an attractive risk/reward trade-off for most investors.\n\nIt could go either way with Exxon and Chevron\n\nYou wouldn't be making a massive mistake if you bought Exxon over Chevron in 2025. But, at the same time, Chevron appears to offer some compelling advantages over Exxon, particularly if you are focused on maximizing the income your portfolio generates. With similar business models, similar financial strength profiles, and similar commitments to shareholder returns (highlighted by their strong dividend track records), choosing higher-yielding Chevron seems like the right call for 2025.",

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger\n\nA lawsuit filed by the state of Vermont against oil giants Exxon Mobil, Shell, Sunoco and others recently took a step forward after years of hurdles.\n\nA Chittenden County Superior Court judge has denied the oil companies\u2019 request to dismiss Vermont\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe complaint, which then-Attorney General TJ Donovan filed in 2021, alleges the companies have long known that their products cause climate change \u2014 which dramatically increases the risk of dangerous extreme weather \u2014 and have actively misrepresented the products\u2019 risks to Vermont consumers. Vermont is one of at least six states to sue the oil companies for misleading consumers about their products.\n\nThe oil companies argued against Vermont\u2019s case on grounds including statute of limitations, freedom of speech, and the state\u2019s jurisdictional authority to bring the lawsuit. Superior Court Judge Megan Shafritz wrote in a Dec. 10 decision that the companies did not present viable reasons to dismiss the case.\n\nPreviously, the oil companies had attempted to move the lawsuit from state to federal court, stalling the case for years. Last February, the federal district court in Burlington sided with the state, saying the case belongs in state court.\n\nLast week, the oil companies appealed the judge\u2019s Dec. 10 decision, said Attorney General Charity Clark, who took on the case when she assumed office in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the Superior Court has to say about that. We will obviously be opposing,\u201d she said.\n\nClark said she thinks the companies are \u201crunning out of tricks.\u201d Still, the lawsuit could go on for years, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that this is going to be resolved anytime soon, but we\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d she said.\n\nClark said she believes the issue is important to Vermonters, who care about the environment.\n\n\u201cThey express that value in the purchases they make, and in this instance, they were deprived of knowing the truth about fossil fuel companies because the fossil fuel companies actively deprived them of the truth. And that\u2019s what this case is about,\u201d she said.\n\nIncreasingly, states are taking action against oil giants in an effort to hold them accountable for climate change.\n\nSeparate from the consumer protection lawsuit, Vermont lawmakers passed a measure during the most recent legislative session that requires the world\u2019s biggest oil companies to pay for damages that their products have caused in the state by way of climate change, called the Climate Superfund Act.\n\nThe law directs each oil company to pay Vermont an amount calculated using those damages and the corresponding percentage of emissions that the company produced between 1995 and 2024. Vermont would use the money to pay for projects that protect its residdents from climate change and help the state adapt to it.\n\nVermont was the first state in the nation to pass such a law. New York became the second on Dec. 26, when Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a similar measure.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute filed a lawsuit against Vermont, calling the law unconstitutional, first reported by Bloomberg Law.\n\nClark declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying the state had not been served yet. The state is likely to file a response in the coming months.",

            "content": "Natural gas prices recently jumped 20% in a single day. That's a pretty shocking move but, frankly, not all that unusual when it comes to energy prices. If you are looking at the broader energy sector and trying to figure out which stock to buy as 2025 gets underway, your best option is probably going to be an integrated energy giant like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) or Chevron (NYSE: CVX).\n\nHere's how these two U.S. energy giants stack up and why you might want to pick Chevron.\n\nThe benefits of integration\n\nAs the natural gas example above highlights, energy prices are highly volatile. That often leads to massive swings in the prices of energy producers. Energy producers live in the upstream segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nThere are, however, two other segments, the midstream and downstream. Midstream companies own things like pipelines and collect fees from companies that use these assets to transport energy commodities. It is a relatively stable segment of the broader energy sector.\n\nMeanwhile, downstream companies use oil and natural gas to produce chemicals and other refined products. Downstream companies often benefit from lower energy prices, though it is important to note that chemicals and refined products are often commodity products themselves subject to their own, sometimes volatile, price dynamics.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIntegrated energy companies like Exxon and Chevron have exposure to all three segments of the broader energy industry. Although oil and natural gas prices are still the driving force behind financial results, having exposure to the midstream and downstream helps to soften the peaks and valleys.\n\nFor most investors, going with an integrated energy company will be the best choice. And sticking to the industry giants, a list that includes Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies, will probably be the best individual option. In this regard, Exxon and Chevron are interchangeable with any of the others on the list.\n\nDividends that keep going up\n\nThat said, Exxon and Chevron stand out in a very important way. They have both increased their dividends annually for decades. BP and Shell cut their dividends during the early days of the pandemic in 2020. TotalEnergies didn't cut its dividend at that point, but it just doesn't have the same track record of regular dividend growth that Exxon and Chevron have. Exxon and Chevron have shown a material dedication to investors and that quickly winnows down the choice from five to two.\n\nBut Exxon's streak of annual dividend increases is better. The energy giant has hiked its dividend for 42 consecutive years. Chevron's streak is \"just\" 37 years long. Clearly, this is something of a fine distinction, since both are very impressive dividend streaks. However, Exxon still gets the edge, even if it is only a slight advantage.",

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Exxon Mobil.\n\nView our latest analysis for Exxon Mobil\n\nNYSE:XOM Ownership Breakdown January 2nd 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Exxon Mobil?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Exxon Mobil does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Exxon Mobil's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:XOM Earnings and Revenue Growth January 2nd 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Exxon Mobil. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.0% and 5.0% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

The company is committing over $200 million to enhance its operations at sites in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas, with plans to process up to 1 billion pounds of plastic waste annually by 2027. This expansion will add 350 million pounds of recycling capacity, bringing ExxonMobil's total to 500 million pounds per year. The investment supports ExxonMobil\u2019s commitment to addressing the global plastic waste crisis by turning hard-to-recycle plastics into valuable raw materials, which can then be used to create everything from fuels and lubricants to high-performance chemicals and packaging materials. ExxonMobil\u2019s advanced recycling technology, already proven at scale in Baytown, plays a critical role in supporting a circular economy and reducing landfill waste.\n\nIn addition to enhancing its Texas operations, ExxonMobil is continuing to develop advanced recycling projects across North America, Europe, and Asia, with the goal of reaching 1 billion pounds of recycling capacity globally. This effort is part of the company\u2019s broader vision to tackle the world\u2019s plastic waste challenge through innovation and collaboration. ExxonMobil\u2019s work with Cyclyx, a joint venture created to improve plastic waste collection and sorting, underscores its role in driving solutions for circularity in plastic waste management. With demand for advanced recycling increasing across multiple sectors, including food-safe packaging and pet food, ExxonMobil is not only addressing environmental concerns but also helping customers meet their circularity goals, ensuring a more sustainable future for plastics.\n\nRead more",

Delayed efforts to contain the spill and naturally strong winds and waves dispersed nearly 11,000,000 gallons (41,640 kilolitres) of North Slope crude oil across the sound. The spill eventually polluted 1,300 miles (2,092 kilometres) of indented shoreline, as well as adjacent waters, as far south as the southern end of Shelikof Strait between Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula. Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens emerged as a strong proponent of securing federal funds to pay for the damage. Thousands of workers and volunteers helped to clean up after the oil spill, and Exxon provided $2.1 billion in funding. Despite these cleanup efforts, the spill exterminated much native wildlife, including salmon, herring, sea otters, bald eagles, and killer whales.\n\n1 of 2 Exxon Valdez oil spill: Naked Island Crews using water from high-pressure hoses to clean oil off rocks on a beach, Naked Island, Alaska, April 21, 1989.

The board also faulted the U.S. Coast Guard for an inadequate system of traffic regulation. After evidence suggested that Joseph J. Hazelwood, the ship\u2019s captain, had been drinking before the accident, Exxon terminated his employment. In 1990 the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act in direct response to the Exxon Valdez accident. Among other measures, the act created procedures for responding to future oil spills, established the legal liabilities of responsible parties, and set a schedule for banning single-hulled tankers from U.S. waters by 2015.\n\nThe Exxon Valdez itself was repaired and returned to service but was legally prohibited by a clause in the Oil Pollution Act from ever reentering Prince William Sound. Recommissioned the Exxon Mediterranean, it worked the Mediterranean Sea until single-hulled vessels were banned from European waters. In 2008 it was converted by a Hong Kong company to an ore carrier, and in 2012, under the name Oriental Nicety, it was sold for scrapping in Alang, India.",

I\u2019m bullish on the $466.5 billion energy giant based on its compelling and realistic plan for increasing earnings and cash flow over the medium term, its attractive dividend yield and strong history as a dividend stock, and its modest valuation.

Additionally, the energy giant has a long-held reputation as a reliable dividend stock. It has paid dividends to its shareholders for an impressive 42 consecutive years and has grown this payout for the past 26 years in a row, making it a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nIn addition to its dividend, Exxon Mobil is returning a lot of capital to shareholders via share repurchases. The Texas-based company plans to buy back $20 billion worth of shares in 2025 and expects to follow this up with a similar pace in 2026. Share buybacks can be accretive to shareholders as they reduce the number of shares outstanding (which increases earnings per share) and because they can be viewed as a signal that management views shares as undervalued.\n\nModest Valuation\n\nOn the subject of valuation, management might be on to something. Shares of Exxon Mobil are quite cheap, trading at just 13.3 times earnings, well below the average valuation for the S&P 500, which currently features an elevated average valuation of 25.2 times earnings.\n\nIn a market environment where many investors and observers are worried that stocks have gotten too expensive following gains of 23.8% for the S&P 500 and 29.8% for the Nasdaq (NDX) in 2024, there are no such concerns about Exxon Mobil. The stock is up just 5.8% this year, leaving it plenty of room to catch up with the broader market rally going forward.\n\nOwning a more defensive stock like Exxon Mobil with a cheap valuation, performance that has lagged the broader market in 2024, and enticing dividend yield could be an attractive place to be positioned if and when investors rotate from some of 2024\u2019s highly-valued winners into some of the market\u2019s laggards.",

These weren\u2019t the only buyers for the month, though; High Tower Advisors boosted theirs by 0.4% to get them to $138.5 million as well.\n\nRisk-to-Reward Setups Favor Oil Stocks\n\nOccidental Petroleum Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 2.11% Annual Dividend $0.96 Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth 180.20% Dividend Payout Ratio 39.34% Next Dividend Payment Apr. 15 OXY Dividend History\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Warren Buffett decided to buy up to 29% of Occidental Petroleum Co. (NYSE OXY): He realizes that the energy sector's upside potential is unmatched. Even hedge funds have started buying up oil futures to load on their inventory in case prices rally from their current cyclical lows.\n\nHowever, not all oil stocks are made the same. Exxon Mobil shares have an inherent advantage: They carry a lower beta, meaning they are less volatile and, therefore, more attractive during this rotation out of lower bond yields into the next best thing.\n\nThis lower beta exposure, coupled with Exxon\u2019s $3.96 a share payout, would make the stock\u2019s 3.7% dividend yield today an attractive proposition when the rotation out of bonds gets to the market. This is especially true as investors realize that it isn\u2019t only the low volatility and income potential but also the upside.\n\nWall Street analysts, particularly those from the UBS Group, were willing to publish their optimistic outlooks on Exxon Mobil stock. As of December 2024, they see Exxon Mobil as a buy and have placed a valuation of $147 a share on it, calling for up to 38% from where it trades today.\n\nA Discount in Whirlpool Stock Won\u2019t Last\n\nWhirlpool Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 7.89% Annual Dividend $7.00 Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth 8.70% Dividend Payout Ratio -119.45% Next Dividend Payment Mar. 15 WHR Dividend History\n\nAs the mortgage market index fell to a 1996 low, lateral names in the real estate sector followed, suggesting less demand and activity in housing. This is why investors can see Whirlpool stock trade at discounts to the rest of the consumer discretionary sector today.\n\nWith a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of only 2.5x, Whirlpool stock is significantly below the sector\u2019s average 5.6x multiple today. This discount, along with its 6.1% dividend payout, makes Whirlpool stock a potential buy for investors looking to successfully rotate out of bonds and into more attractive income-generating assets with some additional upside.\n\nThis theme is reflected in the recent institutional buying activity for Whirlpool stock, led by those from Charles Schwab at a 14.7% boost as of November 2024, getting them to a net $216.1 million position or 3.6% ownership in the company. If the stock is cheap enough for the bank that runs this dividend ETF, then it sure is cheap enough for investors today.\n\nBefore you consider Exxon Mobil, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Exxon Mobil wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Exxon Mobil currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation.\n\nImproved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024.\n\nDividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019\u2014a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates\u2014dividends contributed 75% to the market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nInvestors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company\u2019s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not.\n\nReflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers.",

            "content": "Looking for a top dividend stock to add to your portfolio as we head into 2025? How about energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM)? I\u2019m bullish on the $466.5 billion energy giant based on its compelling and realistic plan for increasing earnings and cash flow over the medium term, its attractive dividend yield and strong history as a dividend stock, and its modest valuation. Additionally, Wall Street analysts believe shares have potential upside of nearly 25% over the next 12 months.\n\nTried and True Dividend Stalwart\n\nExxon Mobil is a great dividend stock based on its yield, consistency, and dividend growth.\n\nFirst and foremost, shares of Exxon Mobil yield an attractive 3.7% on a forward basis, nearly triple the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX), which currently yields just 1.3%. Additionally, the energy giant has a long-held reputation as a reliable dividend stock. It has paid dividends to its shareholders for an impressive 42 consecutive years and has grown this payout for the past 26 years in a row, making it a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nIn addition to its dividend, Exxon Mobil is returning a lot of capital to shareholders via share repurchases. The Texas-based company plans to buy back $20 billion worth of shares in 2025 and expects to follow this up with a similar pace in 2026. Share buybacks can be accretive to shareholders as they reduce the number of shares outstanding (which increases earnings per share) and because they can be viewed as a signal that management views shares as undervalued.\n\nModest Valuation\n\nOn the subject of valuation, management might be on to something. Shares of Exxon Mobil are quite cheap, trading at just 13.3 times earnings, well below the average valuation for the S&P 500, which currently features an elevated average valuation of 25.2 times earnings.\n\nIn a market environment where many investors and observers are worried that stocks have gotten too expensive following gains of 23.8% for the S&P 500 and 29.8% for the Nasdaq (NDX) in 2024, there are no such concerns about Exxon Mobil. The stock is up just 5.8% this year, leaving it plenty of room to catch up with the broader market rally going forward.\n\nOwning a more defensive stock like Exxon Mobil with a cheap valuation, performance that has lagged the broader market in 2024, and enticing dividend yield could be an attractive place to be positioned if and when investors rotate from some of 2024\u2019s highly-valued winners into some of the market\u2019s laggards.\n\nExciting Vision for the Future\n\nWith this above-average yield and undemanding valuation, one might assume that Exxon Mobil doesn\u2019t have much growth ahead of it. However, the company is far from a melting ice cube with its best days behind it \u2014 management has a compelling vision for growing earnings and cash flow from today through 2030, which it recently outlined for investors.\n\nAccording to the plan, Exxon Mobil expects to add $20 billion in potential earnings growth and $30 billion in free cash flow growth between now and 2030. It plans to grow earnings at an attractive 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and cash flow at an 8% CAGR over this time frame.\n\nThe energy giant has many levers it can pull in order to achieve this, which it laid out in its strategic plan. Among other aspects of the plan, the company says it will wring out more synergies from its recent acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources to the tune of $3 billion annually and add $7 billion in structural cost savings compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNot All Cost Cutting\n\nIt\u2019s not all cost-cutting, though \u2013 Exxon Mobil also aims to increase production to 5.4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, with the at least 60% of this output coming from advantaged assets (projects with high returns and low cost of supply, like its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana). The great thing about these targets is that the company isn\u2019t relying on unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky forecasts for oil and natural gas prices in order to hit them. Rather, the company assumes a conservative $65 per barrel for Brent oil, which is actually well below today\u2019s price of about $74 a barrel.\n\nIt also assumes a conservative $3 price for natural gas, well below today\u2019s price of $3.72. Oil prices have languished for much of 2024, and it\u2019s hard to say what will happen between now and 2030, but these conservative forecasts leave plenty of margin for error, and if oil prices are higher between now and 2030, this could represent further upside for Exxon Mobil given these conservative assumptions.\n\nPerhaps best of all, given Exxon Mobil\u2019s longstanding propensity for shareholder returns, management also alluded to much of this extra cash being used to reward its shareholders, stating that \u201ccash flow and earnings growth generate a further $165 billion in surplus cash over the plan period driving increased shareholder distributions.\u201d\n\nIs XOM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XOM earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average analyst XOM stock price target of $131.20 implies 22% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more XOM analyst ratings\n\nA Top Choice for 2025\n\nAdding it all up, I\u2019m bullish on Exxon Mobil as a top dividend stock for 2025 and beyond based on its attractive dividend yield, long and proud history of paying and growing its dividends, inexpensive valuation, and its compelling, yet realistic, plans for delivering significant earnings and cash flow growth through the rest of the 2020s.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nVenezuela\u2019s economic crisis has careened out of control, creating ripple effects with implications for the entire Western Hemisphere. According to the United Nations, 3 million Venezuelans, or 10% of the population, have left Venezuela since 2015.1 An average of 5,000 Venezuelans are fleeing daily,2 and a new study by the Brookings Institution forecasts that a total of 8 million Venezuelans of diverse social classes will soon reside outside the country.3 This mass outflow is likely to surpass the magnitude of the Syrian exodus. It has led to a variety of regional security issues, including increased violence in Brazilian and Colombian border towns4 and proliferation of organized criminal activity like human and arms trafficking.5\n\nOn May 20, 2015, ExxonMobil announced that it had discovered crude oil inGuyana,6 aSouthAmericancountrywithapopulationof800,000peopleand the second weakest economy in the region.7 Guyana shares its western border with Venezuela, and the two countries have long been engaged in a legal battle stemming from Venezuela\u2019s claims to the Essequibo land tract that comprises 40% of Guyana\u2019s current territory.This dispute escalated again after ExxonMobil made first of nine significant discoveries in the Stabroek Block.8 This area off the coast of Guyana is estimated to hold at least 4 billion barrels of crude oil.9 The output is expected to exceed Saudi Arabia\u2019s per capita oil production within a decade10 and could provide a significant economic opportunity for Guyana.\n\nOIL DISCOVERY AND RESOURCE CURSE IN VENEZUELA AND GUYANA\n\nDeveloping countries like Guyana and Venezuela that are well endowed with extractable natural resources frequently fall victim to the \u201cresource curse.\u201d With little to no dependency on tax income and abundant resource revenues, the government fails to develop strong domestic institutions, properly direct investments, and diversify the economy. Oftentimes, the inflow of resource rents promotes corruption, creates economic instability, and increases conflict rates. Assuming Guyana can avoid this fate, the discovery provides an opportunity to reinvigorate and develop the domestic economy. Simultaneously, this discovery will likely exacerbate Venezuela\u2019s economic downfall by diminishing any remaining hope for the revival of its once proliferate oil industry.\n\nWith the largest proven oil reserves in the world,11 Venezuela is a prime example of the dangers of the resource curse. Once considered the crown jewel of Latin America, the country thrived on an oil economy for decades. The socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in his early years in power, capitalized on the high price of oil and extensively invested the revenues to finance a portfolio of social programs including welfare, housing projects, literacy, and healthcare initiatives. From 2003 to 2008, Venezuela experienced positive economic outcomes: the unemployment rate dropped significantly, from 16.75 percent to 6.85 percent,12 and the poverty rate halved from 54 percent to 27.7 percent.13 However, the Ch\u00e1vez regime concurrently became increasingly authoritarian and corrupt as he attempted to consolidate his grip on power. Ch\u00e1vez expanded his executive authority, allowing him to pass laws by decree, and subsequently dismantled the democratic checks and balances system.\n\nCh\u00e1vez also nationalized the oil industry, consolidating it into the state- owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA). PdVSA now operates all of Venezuela\u2019s crude production.14 Both Ch\u00e1vez and his successor, current president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, failed to invest an adequate amount of revenue into maintaining PdVSA and diversifying other sectors of the Venezuelan economy. Diversification would have safeguarded the economy, to some degree, against the global oil market\u2019s inevitable and volatile boom-bust cycles.\n\nIn 2014, a crash in oil prices ignited an economic tailspin in Venezuela as government revenues were wiped out, leading to a deep deficit in the state budget. In response to crashing oil prices and their influence on the Venezuelan economy, the Maduro regime began printing more money to cover costs, contributing to the hyperinflation we see today. In its 2018 World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that inflation in Venezuela could reach 1,370,000 percent by the end of 2018.15\n\nTo combat hyperinflation, the Maduro regime recently redenominated and launched its official currency as the \u201csovereign bol\u00edvar,\u201d slashing five zeros from the end. Then, in another move that baffled analysts, Venezuela announced the launch of a new cryptocurrency, the petro, supposedly backed by oil reserves.The idea behind petro is that it will raise enough money to allow Venezuela to meet its financial obligations and prevent a full-blown default. The Venezuelan government has approximately $150 billion in outstanding foreign debt with about $2.5 billion in default, according to Caracas Capital.16 At current prices, 100 million petros could theoretically raise about $6 billion. However, as a result of underinvestment in PdVSA, oil production has tanked since 201617 and the output is less than half of that in 1999 when Ch\u00e1vez came into power.18 According to oil expert Francisco Monaldi, Venezuela would need investments of at least $8 billion to extract the 5 billion barrels in reserves that are supposedly backing the petro,19 while PdVSA is currently $45 billion in debt. In March 2018, the United States government made it illegal for American companies and citizens to deal in the petro.20 Other countries followed the suit, limiting foreign investment in a climate where investors\u2019 confidence in Venezuela was already low. Furthermore, the petro is not presently found on any major currency exchanges. In a special report, Reuters found no evidence of the petro being used in Venezuela, nor of any efforts to tap into the oil reserves that supposedly back it.21 Thus, it is unlikely that this gamble will pay off.\n\nMoreover, Venezuela is currently experiencing explosive political unrest and one of the highest murder rates in Latin America.22 The United States and other countries have joined in sanctioning Venezuela for human rights violations, corruption, and economic mismanagement.23 In May, the Lima Group, comprised of 14 countries that include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Colombia, formally refused to recognize the Maduro government, citing illegitimacy in the electoral process.24 Today, Venezuela is a risky investment, especially when a more stable political environment and new oil reserves are right next door. As there is no security in the petro, and no one knows what it actually sells for, companies will likely prefer to do business with Guyana, which has a tradeable currency interlinked to the global economy.25\n\nAs a country located between Venezuela and Suriname, Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America. However, since its independence in 1966, the country has been plagued by political corruption and polarization between two parties oriented around ethnicity. As of 2017, over one-third of the country\u2019s population lives below the poverty line,26 with the unemployment rate at 12.5 percent.27 This tense political climate and lack of economic opportunities has led to a high degree of \u201cbrain drain,\u201d a phenomenon that occurs when high-skilled and educated people leave their country to pursue opportunities abroad. Endowed with natural resources, Guyana\u2019s economy has been based largely around exports of minerals and timber, with gold comprising 60 percent of the country\u2019s exports.28 With ExxonMobil\u2019s recent discovery of oil, the World Bank projects Guyana\u2019s annual GDP growth to skyrocket from 3.8 percent in 2019 to 29 percent in 2020.29\n\nConstruction of the first ExxonMobil development, Liza Phase 1, is already underway. Production is slated to commence in early 2020 and is expected to churn out 120,000 barrels of oil a day.30 According to the Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, Guyana\u2019s government is poised to annually accrue over $6 billion in royalties and taxes by the end of the 2020s.31\n\nGuyana should take concrete steps to learn from Venezuela\u2019s mistakes. The country\u2019s growth and development potential hinges on whether the influx of revenues can be accessed by its people and is used to develop domestic institutions and business environment. Guyana must prioritize investment of oil revenue in areas that will lift its population from poverty.This includes the health and education sectors to promote long-term growth, increase productivity, and reverse the country\u2019s \u201cbrain drain\u201d problem. It must also include social welfare programs to alleviate poverty and bolster human development. However, as evidenced by Venezuela, this is just one step in the process towards sustainable development. Guyana must also safeguard its economy from future bust cycles in global oil prices by maintaining economic diversity and continuing to invest in other natural resource and industrial sectors apart from oil and gas.\n\nDIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY\n\nWhen considering actionable economic measures, there are several cases Guyana could seek guidance from. Malaysia is one example of an oil-rich nation that has avoided the resource curse by diversifying its economy and investing in its institutions. Even after the 2014 decline in global oil prices, Malaysia still managed to sustain 5.9 percent growth in 201432, and sustained a positive growth rate for 2015. Where other oil-dependent countries took substantial hits to their economies after the 2014 bust, the IMF attributes the relative stability and maintenance of positive growth in Malaysia to the diversification of its economy. Guyana should look to Malaysia as a model for economic diversification and commit to investing in its mineral and timber sectors, as well as other underdeveloped sectors like manufacturing. Diversification will temper the country\u2019s reliance on oil, which is prone to boom-bust cycles. On the other hand, creation of new opportunities and incorporation of social programs will incentivize Guyana\u2019s top talent to remain there, counteracting the existing brain drain problem.\n\nENSURE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nGuyana is an admitted member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),33 an international oversight initiative that seeks to create openness and accountability in resource-rich countries. While in theory, EITI promotes transparency and accountability, there is no formal mechanism of enforcement to ensure that member states remain faithful to EITI regulations. Guyana must ensure government accountability by contracting an independent oil sector oversight committee to evaluate levels of transparency and corruption, especially as it relates to oil revenue. Guyana should publish an annual report announcing the fiscal year\u2019s earnings, the national budget, along with the sectors, offices, organizations, initiatives, and individuals which received funds derived from oil revenue.Transparency in the nation\u2019s budget and the allocation of oil money will push the government to consistently sustain investments in sectors and initiatives that promote development and benefit the public.\n\nALLOW EXXON TO CONTINUE INVESTMENT\n\nExxonMobil has a vested interest in ensuring that Guyana\u2019s oil industry is developed responsibly and sustainably, not only because stability and low corruption foster a more productive business environment, but also because the company is mitigating a host of reputational challenges. ExxonMobil\u2019s new CEO, Darren Woods, is trying to break away from his predecessor\u2019s legacy of billions of dollars in write-downs and a stock market performance that lags behind peers like Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell.34 The company is also coming off the heels of other reputational challenges, including the 2017 climate change controversy, where a study conducted by two Harvard professors suggested that Exxon had actively misled the public for 40 years about the effects of climate change.35 Thus, Guyana presents ExxonMobil with an opportunity to not only make a massive return on their investment, but also to build its reputational equity through leadership in the sustainable development of Guyana\u2019s energy sector. ExxonMobil has already begun to host workshops to educate Guyanese small business owners and the general public on how they can maximize their skills and advertise their businesses to access and profit from the new oil sector. Hopefully similar initiatives will follow, even after oil production is in full swing.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES\n\nThe U.S. must pay attention to Guyana\u2019s development in the interest of regional security. Guyana is currently a strategic partner in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), working with the United States to combat narcotics trafficking through the Caribbean.36 In its 2016 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the U.S. Department of State cited Guyana as a key transit country for South American cocaine shipments en route to the United States.37 Since the beginning of the surge of Venezuelan migrants to other Latin American countries, analysts have noticed increasing activity by Venezuelan transnational criminal organizations in receiving countries. Members of the so-called Venezuelan \u201cmega-gangs\u201d have been accused of kidnapping, extortion, murder, and narco-trafficking outside of Venezuela.38 Neighboring Guyana is especially at risk of infiltration by these criminal organizations. If resource curse persists in the region, Guyana could become more unstable and corrupt, rendering it less capable of cooperation with the United States on matters of transnational security.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n1 UNHCR, \u201cNumber of Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela Reaches 3 Million,\u201d November 8, 2018, https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2018 /11/5be4192b4/number-refugees-migrants-venezuela- reaches-3-million.html\n\n2 UNHCR, \u201cVenezuela Situation: Responding to the Needs of People Displaced from Venezuela,\u201d January-December 2018, http://reporting.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/unhcr%20venezuela%20 situation%202018%20supplementary%20appeal.pdf\n\n3 Dany Bahar, \u201cHow Many More Migrants and Refugees Can We Expect Out of Venezuela?\u201d Brookings Institution, December 10, 2018, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/12/10/how-many- more-migrants-and-refugees-can-we-expect-out-of-venezuela/\n\n4 Venezuela Investigative Unit, \u201cRestrictions on Venezuela Migrants Boost Criminal Networks,\u201d Insightcrime.org, September 11, 2018, https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/venezuela- migrant-restrictions-boost-criminal-networks/\n\n5 Anastasia Moloney, \u201cVenezuela\u2019s crisis boosts trafficking risk for women, children: experts,\u201d Reuters. com, August 30, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-migrants-trafficking/venezuelas- crisis-boosts-trafficking-risk-for-women-children-experts-idUSKCN1LF1XG\n\n6 Micah Maidenberg and Manuela Andreoni, \u201cThe Country that Wasn\u2019t Ready to Win the Lottery,\u201d Foreign Policy, June 2018, https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/19/the-country-that-wasnt-ready-to- win-the-lottery-guyana-oil/\n\n7 World Atlas, \u201cThe Poorest Countries in South America,\u201d March 26, 2018, https://www.worldatlas. com/articles/the-poorest-countries-in-south-america.html\n\n8 \"Exxon Mobil Declares Major Guyana Finding,\" Energy Monitor Worldwide (Amman, Jordan), January 8, 2018, Newsbank.com, https://infoweb-newsbank-com.proxygw.wrlc.org/apps/news/document-vie w?p=AWNB&docref=news/1694D3EB1D771B28.

However, the country will lose the money it has been earning at the expense of Moscow, the Slovak Ministry of Economy says.\n\n\u201cSlovakia is technically well prepared to stop gas supplies from Russia through Ukraine,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn particular, the state-owned SPP company stores 20% more gas in underground reservoirs than a year ago. In addition, the reservoirs contracted by SPP are almost 100% full even at the end of December, which is atypical for this period.\n\nSPP has a diversified portfolio of gas supplies from five other major international energy suppliers, such as BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, RWE, and ENI. At the same time, Slovakia has gas pipeline connections to each of its neighboring countries. Thus, natural gas can be transported in any direction, according to the Ministry of Economy of Slovakia.\n\nThus, the cessation of Russian gas transit from the east will have mainly financial consequences for Slovakia. Slovakia's gas companies will pay about 177 million euros more in transit fees for gas coming from the west rather than the east, the ministry said.\n\n\u201cSlovakia will lose tens of millions more euros by ceasing to charge for gas transit to third countries,\u201d the Slovak Ministry of Economy added.\n\nUkraine's Naftogaz's gas transit contract with Gazprom expires on January 1, 2025. Ukraine will cut off gas at 7 a.m. Kyiv time, depriving Moscow of about $5-7 billion in revenue a year.\n\nSlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico threatens to cut off electricity supplies to Ukraine because Kyiv does not plan to extend its contract with Moscow. However, Poland has already stated that it is ready to increase electricity supplies to Kyiv, which will cause Slovakia to lose revenue from this business as well.",

The words \"Imagine Peace\" frame Lennon and the art features the guitar and dove icon from the historic Woodstock posters.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I love the message of peace as much as I love John Lennon. (And I spent countless hours in middle and high school biking down Swimming River Road while listening to Beatles CDs.) The location of the mural and the choice of subject left me scratching my head, though.\n\nREAD MORE: History of the Evil Clown of Middletown\n\nWhat do John Lennon and gas stations and New Jersey have in common?\n\nWhy Is There a John Lennon Mural at the Lincroft Exxon?\n\nI'm pretty late to the party when it comes to the John Lennon mural. I grew up in Middletown but moved to the Hudson Valley 10 years ago, so I tend to only come back home for holidays and family events. In the midst of that, I managed to never see cross paths with the mural, which has been on the site for over four years.\n\nWhen I broached the topic on Threads, I got a big response and information about the mural's origin. (Nice job, algorithm.)\n\nREAD MORE: You Know You Hung Out as a Teen in Red Bank in the '90s If...\n\nThe story behind the mural is heartwarming. In the midst of the 2020 quarantine, Exxon owner Scott Brownfeld wanted to find a way to give back and spread a positive message, according to an article in the Two River Times. The mural was designed by Jersey Shore graffiti artist Jay Mack.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 If you love learning about the history of quirky New Jersey road signs, keep reading to learn the origin story of the Evil Clown of Middletown \ud83d\udc47",

At the same time, countries with high year-on-year growth in job postings included Sweden and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to the GlobalData Job Analytics Database.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that even though the US continues to account for a majority of jobs posted by several key players, other countries across different continents are also seeing hiring activity by these companies,\u201d said Sherla Sriprada, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.\n\nMost of the job openings at Exxon and Chevron were for the United States, but the supermajors also posted a significant number of jobs for the Philippines, Argentina, and several India locations.\n\nRelated: Senegal\u2019s First Oil Exports Push Economic Growth to Record High\n\nExxon\u2019s job ads are focusing on EM lithium products in the U.S. and lube operations in Argentina, while Chevron is looking to hire talent for supply and trading bulk operations in Argentina and complying with GHG/methane regulations in the United States, the GlobalData research found.\n\n\u201cEmployment trend analysis at Exxon and Chevron from GlobalData\u2019s Company Filings Analytics Database also reveals that Exxon\u2019s worldwide employee counts have declined over the last five years, while Chevron has seen an increase in 2023,\u201d Sriprada said.\n\n\u201cHowever, Exxon US employee counts have seen a marginal increase in 2023 while Chevron US employee counts had a much healthier growth.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. upstream, Exxon and Chevron, as well as other producers, have been looking to do more with less and have boosted their output even as rig counts have remained relatively flat over the past few months.\n\nDespite the coming administration of a President with friendly policies toward the industry, U.S. producers are not expected to embark on a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d campaign to boost oil and gas output significantly.\n\nCommodity prices and market fundamentals will be much more important signals for the work and production activity that the companies will be doing in 2025 and beyond, although deregulation and faster permitting for energy infrastructure could help, analysts say.\n\nThe priorities of the U.S. oil industry have drastically changed since Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nThe U.S. shale patch is drilling, but it is drilling because it wants to distribute more of the profits to shareholders. It has made huge progress in capital discipline and efficiency gains and is getting more bang for its buck. Priorities are now returns to investors and financial frames capable of withstanding oil price volatility.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to see anybody in 'drill, baby, drill' mode,\" ExxonMobil Upstream President Liam Mallon said at the end of last month.\n\n\u201cA radical change (in production) is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is focused on the economics of what they're doing,\u201d Mallon added.\n\nThe other supermajor, Chevron, announced in early December that its 2025 capital expenditure (capex) would be lower than in 2024.\n\nChevron expects its upstream spending next year to be about $13 billion, of which roughly two-thirds will go to develop its U.S. portfolio.\n\n\u201cPermian Basin spend is lower than the 2024 budget and anticipated to be between $4.5 and $5.0 billion as production growth is reduced in favor of free cash flow,\u201d Chevron said.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

            "content": "Dublin, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"N-Hexane Market Report Global Forecast By Application, Countries and Company Analysis\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global n-Hexane market is projected to surge from US$2.45 billion in 2024 to US$3.46 billion by 2033 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.91% from 2025 to 2033.\n\nThe rise in demand for pharmaceuticals, adhesives, and chemical extraction is the key driver for the n-hexane market growth. N-hexane is primarily used as a solvent, particularly in extracting edible oils, thereby adding up to its market growth. With growing industrial applications, further growth will be shown in the market in the forecast period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Factors Driving the n-Hexane Market Growth\n\nGrowing Demand in the Edible Oil Extraction Industry\n\n\n\nn-Hexane's ability to effectively extract oil from seeds and vegetables makes it a vital component in the edible oil industry. As global consumption of cooking oils, particularly soybean and sunflower, rises, the demand for n-Hexane follows suit. Its efficiency in separating oils from organic matter has made it indispensable in large-scale food processing industries worldwide. With increasing population and urbanization, emerging markets also contribute to this growth as they seek cost-effective solutions for oil extraction to meet growing consumer demands for edible oils.\n\n\n\nExpanding Use in Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industry\n\n\n\nApplications of n-Hexane in drug formulation and solvent manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries play a very important role in the market. The fact that it is non-polar means it acts effectively for the solubilization of compounds otherwise hard to handle. This diversity, combined with increased pharmaceutical production around the world, has fueled demand. More importantly, n-Hexane is applied in a number of chemical extraction processes that are important to industry applications and continue to drive growth in the market as those industries expand and evolve.\n\n\n\nRising Demand in Adhesives, Inks, and Rubber Manufacturing\n\n\n\nWith solvent properties, n-Hexane is used extensively in the manufacture of adhesives, printing inks, and rubber. Such an application gives way to effective bonding and processing of materials. Increasing global industrialization and construction call for demand for such products. Additionally, the growing automobile industries provide for a higher demand on rubber and adhesives, which are produced using n-Hexane. Therefore, industrial growth would further augment steady market growth in the coming years.\n\n\n\nUnited States n-Hexane Market\n\n\n\nThe n-Hexane market in the United States remains strong since it is broadly applied in all sectors involved in oil extraction, pharmaceuticals, and adhesives. Its demand is also significantly contributed by the strong agricultural sector of the country, particularly soybean and corn oil extraction. There is also the growing pharmaceutical industry that uses it as a solvent in drug production. Industrial applications such as rubber and adhesive manufacturing increase its market even more.\n\nHowever, long-term growth in the market may be impacted by increasing regulatory scrutiny amid concerns for the environment and health. The United States Department of Agriculture forecasts that global production of vegetable oil would be 222.85 million metric tons between 2023 and 2024. Of the palm oil total, an estimated 90% is consumed as food, while the remaining 10% is for industrial purposes: cosmetics, fuel, and diesel. The soybean oil was primarily consumed, followed by 61.68 million tons in 2022 globally. Considering all these facts mentioned above, edible oil extraction application is most likely to lead the n-hexane market for the forecast period. The n-Hexane industry of Germany is gaining at a moderate growth rate primarily owing to the production of oil extraction, pharmaceutical industries, and various other industrial applications.\n\n\n\nGermany n-Hexane Industry\n\n\n\nGermany is the hub of Europe's industrial centers and has a high requirement for n-Hexane to provide various manufacturing industries that are adhesives, rubber, and chemical manufacturing. Pharmaceutical manufacturers also require n-Hexane as a solvent in drug formulation. Again, strict environmental compliances regarding VOCs within the European Union might later affect the industry in terms of having safer and more eco-friendly alternatives. The n-Hexane industry grows well in Indonesia mainly since it has been consuming quite large portions in the extraction process of vegetable oils, mainly for palm oil which is one of the leading sectors in the country.\n\n\n\nIndonesia n-Hexane Industry\n\n\n\nIndonesia, being one of the world's leading producers of palm oil, has consequently high demand for n-Hexane since there are highly efficient processes that use such solvents in extractions of oils. n-Hexane also finds uses in manufacturing adhesives and rubber industries in addition to chemical industries, hence catalyzing the growth in the development of the country's industrial sectors. According to estimates made by the US Department of Agriculture, total oil produced by Indonesia in the year 2023-2024 was around 53.32 million metric tons.\n\n\n\nGlobal n-Hexane Company Analysis\n\n\n\nThe key players in n-hexane industry are ExxonMobil, Shell, Indian Oil Corporation, Chevron, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, DHC Solvent Chemie, Sak Chaisidhi Company and Liaoning Yufeng Chemical Co.\n\n\n\nGlobal n-Hexane Company News\n\nMay 2024: A joint venture between Chandra Asri Capital Pte. Ltd. and Glencore Asian Holdings Pte. Ltd., CAPGC Pte. Ltd., will purchase Singapore's Energy and Chemicals Park from Royal Dutch Shell PLC. Through the deal, CAPGC will acquire Shell's entire stake in Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore.\n\nMay 2024: The Exxon Mobil Corporation said that the Pioneer Natural Resources Company transaction had been completed. With the largest, highest-return development potential in the Permian Basin, an unconventional business will be created by the merging of ExxonMobil and Pioneer.\n\nMay 2024: A framework agreement for strategic partnership was signed in Paris by Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO and chairman of TotalEnergies, and Ma Yongsheng, the chairman of Sinopec. The agreement states that the two parties would look for more opportunities for collaboration in a range of industries, such as the development of oil and gas, the LNG value chain, chemicals and refining, engineering and trading, new energy, and so forth.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 100 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $2.45 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $3.46 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 3.9% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "The EXIM board approved about $527 million in financing for an ExxonMobil-supported gas-to-power project that the export credit agency said would double Guyana's installed generation capacity.\n\nThe board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has approved about $527 million in financing for an Exxon Mobil Corp.-supported gas-to-power project in Guyana that the export credit agency said would double the South American country\u2019s installed generation capacity.\n\nThe loan to the Guyanese Finance Ministry will aid the construction of a natural gas separation plant and a 300-megawatt combined-cycle gas turbine power plant, as well as support services related to the gas pipeline near the capital Georgetown.\n\n\u201cThis project will allow Guyana to transition to more reliable and cleaner energy for consumers and businesses by using natural gas-powered turbines to generate electricity\u201d, EXIM said in an online statement. \u201cWithout this gas-to-energy project, Guyana will continue to import fuel oil, one of the highest polluting fossil fuels, and be unable to decommission hundreds of less efficient local generators\u201d.\n\nThe project will avoid over 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year, the equivalent of consuming over one million barrels of oil, according to EXIM.\n\nEXIM president and chair Reta Jo Lewis said, \u201cI am especially proud to continue to support Bank priorities and charter mandates along with projects that align with the administration\u2019s economic, energy, and national security priorities\u201d.\n\nEXIM added, \u201cThe financing will support a U.S. joint venture involving Lindsayca, a Texas-based company, and CH4 Systems, a Puerto Rican small business, and services provided by ExxonMobil\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe financing will also support more than one dozen U.S. companies\u201d, it said, adding the project will provide about 1,500 jobs across 11 U.S. states and territories.\n\nThe loan is also an implementation of EXIM\u2019s China and Transformational Exports Program, a mandate for the agency to aid U.S. exporters facing competition from Chinese counterparts, EXIM said.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), the Guyanese project would only contribute to grid overbuild at the expense of the project being bailed out due to debt.\n\n\u201cExxonMobil would gain the most from the Gas to Energy Project, through profits from pipeline construction, lending money to Guyana, and selling natural gas\u201d, the Lakewood, Ohio-based think tank said in an analysis published October 4, 2023.\n\n\u201cInstead of spending billions for an overbuilt, fossil fuel-reliant grid that will leave Guyana in debt for years, IEEFA found that Guyana could use its oil profits for a reliable, low-cost rooftop solar solution that would save billions while providing low-carbon electricity to the entire country\u201d, IEEFA added.\n\nGuyana\u2019s Department of Public Information (DPI) said in a separate statement about the loan approval that an independent technical and environmental feasibility study had been conducted and a review by the U.S. Congress passed before the loan approval.\n\nOn criticisms that the loan supports a fossil fuel project, Guyanese Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo, in comments relayed in the DPI statement, pointed to EXIM\u2019s statement that the project will result in emission reduction.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the government will be saving approximately $100 million annually on fuel costs, while electricity costs will be slashed by 50 percent, leading to an annual saving of $250 million\u201d, the DPI statement added.\n\nJagdeo said, \u201cIt has an impact on both balance of payment of the country and also in the pockets of Guyanese companies and individuals\u201d. Jadeo noted the EXIM loan would cover only 25 percent of the project.\n\nThe DPI said, \u201cApproximately $2 billion is required to construct the major facility, with the government expending its own resources to finance the rest of the project, including through a partnership with ExxonMobil\u201d.\n\nIn a response to a comment request by Rigzone about the concerns raised by IEEFA, an EXIM spokesperson referred to comments from U.S. authorities that said the project would result in fewer emissions by using gas to produce power, lower bills for Guyanese consumers and create jobs for Americans.\n\nExxonMobil and Guyana\u2019s Finance Ministry and DPI have not responded to Rigzone's comment requests about IEEFA's warnings.\n\nTo contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com",

            "content": "The new Trump administration is primed to usher in a more business-friendly approach to mergers and acquisitions, boosting a key practice area for many top law firms.\n\nAndrew Ferguson, Trump\u2019s pick to chair the Federal Trade Commission, has already said he plans to roll back Biden-era regulations and \u201cstop Lina Khan\u2019s war on mergers.\u201d That\u2019s welcome news for companies, but it doesn\u2019t mean regulators are going to completely stop enforcing the law, said Philip Richter, co-head of the M&A practice at Fried Frank.\n\n\u201cThe general view is that there will be traditional antitrust enforcement, like there has always been,\u201d Richter said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should think this is going to be an open door and any deal can get through\u2014and there will always be different industries where there\u2019s focus, whether that\u2019s going to be healthcare or technology.\u201d\n\nFerguson and Mark Meador, whom Trump plans to nominate for another FTC seat, have signaled they want to crack down on large tech companies. So has the president-elect: \u201cBig Tech has run wild for years,\u201d Trump said in a Dec. 4 social media post announcing Gail Slater as his choice to lead the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\n\nTrump has also expressed disapproval of United States Steel Corp\u2019s sale to Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel Corp.\n\nHere are three sectors the Big Law dealmakers are closely watching in 2025.\n\nEnergy\n\nTrump\u2019s goal to boost energy production could mean looser oversight of the oil and gas industry, which has already seen significant consolidation.\n\nSeveral large energy deals were slowed by Biden administration antitrust regulators who used \u201csecond requests\u201d to prevent certain transactions from closing during investigations. The FTC allowed high-profile energy deals to go through following the reviews, but some Republicans criticized the agency for needlessly scrutinizing the transactions..\n\nThe agency in May cleared Exxon Mobil Corp.'s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., on the condition that Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield not join Exxon\u2019s board. The FTC also green-lit Chevron Corp.'s $53 billion purchase of oil rival Hess Corp. in September. ConocoPhillips completed its $17 billion deal to buy Marathon Oil Corp. two months later.\n\nPending energy deals include oilfield services company SLB\u2019s $7.75 billion acquisition of rival ChampionX, which received a second request for more information from the Justice Department in July. It is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.\n\nBanking\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House is likely to pave the way for Capital One Financial Corp.'s takeover of Discover Financial Services, which will create the world\u2019s largest credit card issuer by loan volume. Both companies saw shares spike following Trump\u2019s November win.\n\nThe deal is pending approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, while the DOJ could still weigh in.\n\nRegulators will also inherit several existing cases, including the Justice Department\u2019s September lawsuit against Visa, which alleges that Visa has a monopoly over debit network markets. Meador worked on DOJ antitrust investigations in the first Trump administration, including the department\u2019s challenge of Visa\u2019s proposed $5.3 billion merger with Plaid. The companies walked away from the deal after the department sued to block it.\n\n\n\nTech\n\nTrump and his backers have been vocal critics of the industry, promising on the campaign trail to put tech companies under a microscope in his second term.\n\nAntitrust regulators will inherit ongoing cases against Amazon, Google, and Meta, as well as an investigation into Microsoft. They will have big decisions to make, including whether to continue the Biden DOJ\u2019s push to break up Google.\n\nMeador was an adviser to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) when he introduced a bill that would have forced Google to break up its digital advertising business.\n\nTrump and other Republicans also have long complained about perceived censorship by Big Tech companies.\n\n\u201cAt the FTC, we will end Big Tech\u2019s vendetta against competition and free speech,\u201d Ferguson wrote in a memo circulated after Trump announced Ferguson would be tapped to lead the agency.",

            "content": "President Irfaan Ali has defended the government\u2019s support to the recently held Global Super League T20 tournament and justified it in the context of the drive for more tourists to the country.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the financing of the league which had been hinted at earlier this year by Ali and formally announced at the finals of the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) tournament here.\n\nDuring his `In The Seat\u2019 interview programme on December 20, Ali was asked by Stabroek News whether cash or other support was provided to the tournament and whether it was being run by a company and who the principals were.\n\nThe President said: \u201cI made it very clear that sports must be an important plan of our tourism product. It must be an important plan of our diversification plan, sports all over the world. If you look at what is happening in Saudi Arabia, if you look at what is happening in UAE, in Qatar, in in India, sports is an important part of the whole industry itself. When you look at the wealth the CPL has been able to create, it became important for us to build an international event that will fill the hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building all of these hotels. Who\u2019s going to full it? What is going to fill it? If we don\u2019t build these events and build these important international standard events, then how are we going to support these industries? So the government must create an enabling environment. The government must support an enabling environment. The government must pursue policies that stimulate investment in these types of events. And that is what we did. We created an ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stimulating, encouraging investments. We support, of course, the government must, must support, not we haven\u2019t put any cash into it, but in-kind support. We have to have a stadium. We have to have facility. You have to have security, you have to have roadways\u2026 We have to have these things to support a major event like that, any international event, any government, must have these facilities, must invest in these facilities.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to build something, we have to build something we are proud of. We have to build something that is of international standard. And I\u2019m hoping that the investment can go further. Could build out a sports infrastructure with new stadiums, world class facility that will bring more events to Guyana. That is my aim. I want to see the Guyana Motor Racing (and Sports Club), and I told them, come up with a plan as to how we can bring international racing here, because it brings traffic into the country. My concern is, how do we invest in opportunity? How do we bring traffic into the country?\u201d\n\nMaking a virtual presentation on April 25th this year at a CARICOM meeting in Trinidad on cricket, Ali said \u201cI believe that we need to examine whether we need to move West Indies cricket from the West Indies Cricket Board to the American Cricket Board. Because we have to work towards owning cricket in the Americas. So how do we develop a strategy where West Indies Cricket becomes the owner of cricket within the Americas? These are things we have to address.\u201d\n\nTaking note of the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) as an opportunity for the region to advance its cricketing structure, Ali said \u201cwe have to work and see how we can expand and build on this opportunity to lead us into the best form of franchise cricket. In Guyana we are working with CWI (Cricket West indies), CPL and ICC (International Cricket Council) to launch a new product for the region that will position the region in the global market and that is the World Premier League\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe World Premier League we\u2019re hoping can replace what used to be the Champions League. That league would have had the best sides coming together to play to recognize the best franchise team\u201d, he had said.\n\nOn October 6th this year, as the curtains came down on the 2024 season of the Republic Bank-sponsored Caribbean Premier League, legendary Guyanese and West Indies cricketer Sir Clive Lloyd announced the launch of the Global Super League with a prize fund of US$1 million. Sir Clive went on to thank Ali \u201cfor his vision of a new cricket event for Guyana, one that will captivate the world.\u201d\n\nQuestions were immediately asked as to who was funding the prize money as there were suggestions that it might be Guyana but no answer was provided.\n\nLater in October, it was announced that ExxonMobil Guyana would serve as the title sponsor for the inaugural Global Super League. Chairman of the GSL Sir Clive said, \u201cExxonMobil Guyana has a long history of supporting cricket in Guyana. They are an ideal title sponsor \u2013 we appreciate their continued investment in Guyana.\u201d\n\nExxonMobil Guyana President Alistair Routledge said, \u201cWe are thrilled to deepen our commitment to cricket and the community in Guyana through our partnership with the Global Super League. We look forward to an electrifying series of matches and celebrating the spirit of cricket with fans around the world.\u201d\n\nThe first instalment of the league from November 26th-December 7th has had mixed reviews and crowd attendance on some days was sparse. No information is available on the company running it and whether financials will be provided to the public show the various inputs by Guyana and others, payment to employees of the company and a profit and loss statement.",
