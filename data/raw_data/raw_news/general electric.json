            "content": "Investors in General Electric Co (Symbol: GE) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the GE options chain for the new May 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $190.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $182.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of GE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $191.99/share today.\n\nBecause the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.87% return on the cash commitment, or 28.24% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for General Electric Co, and highlighting in green where the $190.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of GE stock at the current price level of $191.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.92% if the stock gets called away at the May 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GE shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for General Electric Co, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GE's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 31.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 37%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 36%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $191.99) to be 32%.

(Picture source: Raimo Roonet Aviation Photography via Facebook/Flygvapnet)\n\nColombia\u2019s consideration of the Saab Gripen dates back nearly a decade, with Saab actively engaging the country\u2019s defense institutions as early as 2016. Initial offers included the Gripen C/D and the future Gripen E variant, with Saab highlighting technology transfer, low maintenance costs, and rapid delivery timelines. The company also positioned the Gripen as a cost-effective solution aligned with Colombia\u2019s budget constraints, emphasizing the aircraft\u2019s operational performance from austere bases and its adaptability to asymmetric conflict environments. Despite these efforts, the Colombian Air Force (FAC) consistently ranked the Gripen below other candidates, including the F-16, Rafale, and Eurofighter Typhoon, during earlier evaluation phases. Saab\u2019s proposition gained renewed momentum following President Gustavo Petro\u2019s 2022 election and a shift in political priorities. In June 2024, Petro visited Sweden and met with Saab executives, with discussions including offset proposals and financing terms. The Colombian presidency later confirmed that Saab had offered favorable conditions, including an eight-year interest-free grace period and Swedish bank financing, along with industrial offsets tied to renewable energy, healthcare, and water infrastructure. This is all the more surprising given that Colombia previously sent a Letter of Request (LOR) to the U.S. in 2018 (during Trump's first term) to inquire about the availability and pricing of 18 F-16C/D fighter jets from U.S. Air Force inventories. The U.S. later expanded its offer to include a mix of donated and new F-16s, potentially totaling 24 aircraft. Despite this, the Colombian Air Force did not proceed with the acquisition. Factors influencing that decision included maintenance costs, infrastructure readiness, and evolving political considerations under the current administration. Although Saab and the Colombian government have denied that the Gripen deal has been formally blocked by a potential veto from the United States concerning the re-export of the General Electric F414 engine, multiple sources suggest that the U.S. administration has intervened to steer Colombia toward American alternatives, particularly the F-16V. U.S. efforts have reportedly included not only political pressure but also economic tariffs. These actions, perceived as an attempt to influence Colombia's decisions solely in favor of the U.S., could have been perceived in Colombia as a threat on its strategic independence, potentially influencing the country to diversify its defense partnerships. Therefore, while the formal contract has not yet been signed with Saab, the decision marks a shift away from traditional U.S.-aligned procurement and positions Colombia to become the second Latin American operator of the Gripen, after Brazil.\n\nDeveloped in cooperation with Brazil, which ordered 36 aircraft, the Gripen E, previously referred to as Gripen NG (Next Generation), represents the latest and most advanced evolution of the Gripen. (Picture source: Brazilian Air Force)\n\nColombia's prospective acquisition of the same aircraft would place it within the Brazilian logistical and maintenance framework, as both the Super Tucano A-29 and Gripen are assembled or manufactured in Brazil. Colombian defense officials have raised concerns that such dependence could limit national autonomy in future operations. Moreover, while Brazil has had a lengthy experience integrating the Gripen \u2014 from contract signing in 2014 to first delivery in 2022 \u2014 it is now reportedly exploring additional acquisitions. On September 11, 2024, Brazilian Air Force Commander, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno, confirmed that the country intends to maintain a fleet of no fewer than two and no more than three types of fighter aircraft. As the F-5 is phased out, the known candidates include the Indian Tejas, the Chinese Chengdu J-10CE, the American F-16V, the French Rafale, and even the Russian Su-35. Designed for short-field performance and ease of maintenance, the Swedish JAS 39 Gripen is a single-engine multirole fighter aircraft developed by Saab in the late 1980s to replace the Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force. Designed from the outset to operate from rudimentary road bases under the Swedish Bas 90 system, the initial Gripen A/B entered service in the 1990s, followed by the C/D models, which improved NATO interoperability and updated the combat systems. Developed in cooperation with Brazil, which ordered 36 aircraft, the Gripen E, previously referred to as Gripen NG (Next Generation), represents the latest and most advanced evolution of the Gripen. It includes a larger fuselage, an upgraded engine, major upgrades in avionics, and expanded weapons capabilities. Powered by the General Electric F414G engine, shared with the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the Gripen E offers a maximum thrust of 98 kN, a combat radius of more than 1,300 km without refueling, a maximum take-off weight of 16,500 kilograms, and can reach speeds up to Mach 2. The aircraft\u2019s delta wing and canard configuration, combined with fly-by-wire controls and embedded AI for human-machine collaboration, contribute to its maneuverability. It supports air-to-air refueling to extend its operational range. Its design allows for operations in both conventional and close-range aerial engagements and is configured for dispersed deployments, including short or unprepared runways. The Gripen E\u2019s electronic warfare suite is one of its defining features. Offering 360-degree spherical coverage, the system integrates radar warning receivers, missile approach warners, and jamming pods. The aircraft\u2019s electronic countermeasure capabilities allow it to degrade or suppress enemy sensors and communications, providing survivability in contested airspace. Saab emphasizes that these features make the Gripen E suitable for penetrating enemy air defenses while also supporting real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. Combined with a modular avionics system that supports rapid mission updates, these features provide electronic support, attack, and protection functions, including signal detection, countermeasures management, and electromagnetic signal analysis. The Gripen E incorporates an open architecture system that separates mission systems from flight-critical software, allowing new capabilities to be integrated without affecting the certification of the core flight software. This modular design permits quicker software updates and adaptation to new operational requirements. The aircraft is configured for rapid turnaround, with air-to-air rearming and refueling achievable in under 20 minutes using a limited number of ground personnel and minimal equipment. It can operate in austere environments and from short, unprepared runways, making it suitable for Colombia\u2019s geographically dispersed and rugged operational landscape. The aircraft has ten external hardpoints that support a range of weapons and external pods. For air-to-air operations, it can carry up to seven Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and two IRIS-T within-visual-range missiles. For ground attack missions, the Gripen E supports various air-to-ground munitions, including guided bombs. It is also equipped with a Mauser BK-27 mm internal gun. The Gripen E is capable of performing air-to-air, air-to-ground, and reconnaissance missions, depending on payload configuration. These features allow the aircraft to fulfill multiple operational roles using a common platform. This efficiency supports high sortie rates and makes it ideal for dispersed operations, such as those required in remote Colombian regions facing insurgent or narcotics trafficking threats. Its compatibility with austere airstrips gives it a unique edge in scenarios requiring rapid deployment and mobility, which the F-16 cannot do. Whether the deal overcomes current obstacles (like those posed by the US) remains uncertain, but the Gripen E, if acquired, is poised to play a central role in Colombia's future air power projection.",

Starting in April, customers can expect to see a rebate of about $12 on average.\n\nIn October, the PUC ordered Xcel to pay back the $48 million it charged customers after the 2011 failure. The company was found to be partially negligent in operating and maintaining Sherco 3 and 48% at fault for the costs.\n\nThe accident at the giant generator inside Sherco 3 caused the massive turbine blades to be ripped from their mountings, whipping huge metal shards across the plant and sparking a fire. No one was hurt, but the generator was shut down for almost two years while $239 million in repairs were conducted.\n\nInsurance paid for most of that, but the utility had to find a way to replace power at Sherco from its other plants. The PUC let Xcel charge its customers for it.\n\nXcel sued turbine manufacturer General Electric in 2013, saying corrosion and stress cracks in the blades were to blame and that the company had known about the deficiencies for years but did nothing to address them. The two sides settled in 2018, and Xcel directed the money back to its customers, but the utility\u2019s insurance companies continued to fight it out in court with GE.\n\nAll the litigation was settled in 2020, but there has been a fight over replacement power costs ever since. The Minnesota Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Department of Commerce said customers were due a refund, but Xcel said no. Power replacement costs from 2011 to 2013, plus interest, totaled $71.5 million.\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2025 Leighton Media. All rights reserved.

            "content": "The General Motors EV1 pioneered technology you can still find in electric vehicles today. Just over 1,000 were built, and the cars were only available for lease in a few states.\n\nHere in Los Angeles: You can see one of only 40 EV1s still intact at the Petersen Automotive Museum.\n\nWhy it matters: GM built just over 1,000 EV1s before ending production in 1999, spawning a community of passionate super fans eager to join the EV revolution. But the EV1 was controversial, and short-lived. Many Americans never knew the EV1 existed \u2014 and the fight to keep it alive ended with GM crushing nearly all the cars into scrap.\n\nThe backstory: The EV1's origins can be traced to 1990, when California passed sweeping regulations aimed at curbing the state's air pollution. The plan mandated automakers build zero-emission vehicles. By 1996, General Motors EV1 hit the market.\n\nRead the full story\n\nIt was the most reliable car he had ever driven \u2014 that's how Kris Trexler remembered his General Motors EV1.\n\n\"It was just a car that I took home, plugged in at night, got up the next morning \u2014 it was like having a gasoline station in the garage,\" he told NPR Member station Michigan Public in 2010.\n\nTrexler was one of the hundreds of people who got to drive an EV1 \u2014 the first modern, mass-produced electric vehicle from a major automaker. The little two-door car looked like a cross between a flying saucer and a computer mouse, and it pioneered technology you can still find in today's EVs.\n\nGM built just over 1,000 EV1s before ending production in 1999, spawning a community of passionate super fans eager to join the EV revolution. But the EV1 was controversial, and short-lived. It was on the road for less than a decade. Many Americans never knew the EV1 existed \u2014 and the fight to keep it alive ended with GM crushing nearly all the cars into scrap.\n\n\"When it all happened, we just stood there and said, 'What are you guys doing?' \" filmmaker and EV advocate Chris Paine told NPR in a 2006 interview about his documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? \"The sight of seeing them destroyed before most people ever got to experience them was really quite a shocking moment for us.\"\n\nThe EV1's origins\n\nThe story of the EV1 began in 1990, when California passed sweeping regulations aimed at curbing the state's air pollution. The plan mandated automakers build zero-emission vehicles.\n\n\"It's a very radical strategy, but it's one that looks well into the next century,\" California Air Resources Board member Brian Bilbray said at the time. \"And it's really going to set the standard for air-quality strategies, not in just this state or this nation, but in the world.\"\n\nUnder pressure, automakers researched electric vehicles, hybrids and even hydrogen fuel cells to comply with the mandate. In 1992, reporter Paul Eisenstein was assigned by NPR to check out the early results, traveling to Arizona to test drive a GM prototype called the Impact.\n\n\"As you turn the key, nothing seems to be happening \u2014 until you stomp on the Impact's accelerator,\" Eisenstein reported. \"Then with a sudden lurch and an eerie whine, the Impact bursts to life, the speedometer ticking off five, 15, 30, 45 miles an hour.\"\n\nThis is the car that by 1996 hit the market as the EV1. It had zippy acceleration, aerodynamic bodywork that partially covered the rear tires, and an innovative braking system that helped recharge the battery.\n\n\"Regenerative braking works by using the motors \u2014 the drive motors \u2014 in reverse, and they act as generators,\" GM engineer Larry Oswald said. \"So when you apply the brake pedal, essentially what you're doing is generating electricity and putting it back into the battery and storing it for the next acceleration.\"\n\nThe car's battery could take you about 70 miles on a full charge. Battery technology improved over the years, increasing the EV1's range to about 100 miles. But the EV1 gave rise to a new consumer concern: \"range anxiety.\"\n\n\"The fear of being stranded; running out of power,\" Consumer Reports researcher Ron Conlin told NPR in 1997. \"The anxiety of the consumer is reflected in our studies.\"\n\nThe EV1 was only available in a few states. And it was expensive: The suggested retail price was $35,000 (more than $70,000 in today's money) but it never actually was for sale \u2014 it was only available for lease.\n\n\"The car's being marketed to an upscale consumer \u2014 very educated, very affluent, as potentially a third vehicle in the household,\" Conlin said.\n\nOnly about 800 drivers leased an EV1, according to an Associated Press article from 2005. However, reports indicated thousands more people put their name on a wait list. GM spokesperson Dave Barthmuss told NPR that the company followed up with those people, and found \"less than 50 customers\" on the wait list were willing to lease a vehicle.\n\nMany who did get the chance to lease an EV1 grew to love the way the car \u2014 with its plug-in charging and appliance-like charm \u2014 made them feel \"like we were in the 21st century,\" said documentarian Chris Paine.\n\nA little car with a big legacy\n\nGM had spent more than $1 billion on EV development. But over time, California weakened the mandate to build zero-emission vehicles. The EV1 became an unnecessary cost.\n\nThe cars' three-year lease agreements expired in the early 2000s, but GM canceled the program and took its EV1s back. In 2005, NPR reporter Luke Burbank visited a GM facility in Southern California storing dozens of repossessed EV1s. The car's supporters held vigil outside.\n\n\"We call that EV1 death row,\" said Chelsea Sexton, a former GM employee who worked on the EV1 program and was critical of the company's move to stop making electric vehicles.\n\n\"It absolutely breaks my heart,\" Sexton told NPR. \"I helped put these cars on the road in the first place, and now they're taking them away from me and from all the other drivers that had them at one point.\"\n\nChelsea Sexton hugs Paul Scott during a vigil held outside the General Motors Training Center in Burbank, Calif., protesting GM's plans to crush its EV1 electric vehicles located in the facility's parking lot. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times / Getty Images )\n\nGM loaded the EV1s onto semi trucks, hauled them to Mesa, Ariz., and crushed them. Photos showed flattened EV1s stacked on top of each other. GM said the cars were destroyed because a lack of replacement parts made the EV1 unsafe.\n\n\"There are 2,000 unique parts to this vehicle,\" Barthmuss said. \"Some of them are computer control modules that control the braking on the vehicle. If that part fails, there are some serious safety concerns.\"\n\nThe EV1 was ahead of its time\n\nTwenty-five years after EV1 production ended, every major automaker is building EVs \u2014 including GM. In October the company said it's on track to build about 200,000 EVs this year. GM set a goal to phase out gas-powered vehicles by 2035.\n\nAs for the EV1, some of the little cars escaped the crusher. In 2010, former EV1 driver Kris Trexler visited the very car he once plugged in to charge each night. It was in a new home: the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles \u2014 one of only 40 EV1s still intact, according to the museum.\n\n\"Wow, this brings back some serious memories,\" Trexler said. \"This is just amazing to see this car again.\"",

The initial October 2023 contract was valued at $2.2 billion, and modified in August 2024 with a further $1.3 billion.\n\nThe contract is due to be completed by September 2035, with the largest portion of the work to be completed in Sunnyvale, Calif. Sites in 10 other states are also set to contribute.\n\nVirginia-class subs are fast-attack, missile-armed vessels designed for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering operations. The program has been underway for over two decades, and the U.S. Navy anticipates they will replace the Los Angeles-class subs over the coming decades.\n\nThe Block VI series, anticipated to cover nine or 10 vessels, will introduce a series of new warfare capabilities, including hypersonic weapon technologies, enhanced stealth capabilities for undersea warfare, and abilities to launch and recover undersea drones.\n\nReports suggest the new Block VI series also will offer advanced undersea data networking systems for real-time information sharing with air, surface, and land platforms.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat is the program\u2019s prime contractor and lead design yard, which also builds the vessels in a teaming arrangement with Huntington Ingalls Industries\u2019 Newport News Shipbuilding.\n\n\"This contract modification drives continuation of the crucial demand signal that the submarine industrial base needs to invest in the capacity and materials required to increase production volume,\" stated Mark Rayha, president of General Dynamics Electric Boat. \"Consistent funding for the supply base is essential to achieve the high-rate production the Navy requires of the entire submarine enterprise.\"",

            "content": "MIT and GE Vernova today announced the creation of the MIT-GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance to help develop and scale sustainable energy systems across the globe.\n\nThe alliance launches a five-year collaboration between MIT and GE Vernova, a global energy company that spun off from General Electric\u2019s energy business in 2024. The endeavor will encompass research, education, and career opportunities for students, faculty, and staff across MIT\u2019s five schools and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. It will focus on three main themes: decarbonization, electrification, and renewables acceleration.\n\n\u201cThis alliance will provide MIT students and researchers with a tremendous opportunity to work on energy solutions that could have real-world impact,\u201d says Anantha Chandrakasan, MIT\u2019s chief innovation and strategy officer and dean of the School of Engineering. \u201cGE Vernova brings domain knowledge and expertise deploying these at scale. When our researchers develop new innovative technologies, GE Vernova is strongly positioned to bring them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThrough the alliance, GE Vernova is sponsoring research projects at MIT and providing philanthropic support for MIT research fellowships. The company will also engage with MIT\u2019s community through participation in corporate membership programs and professional education.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to combine forces with MIT\u2019s world-class faculty and students as we work together to realize an optimistic, innovation-driven approach to solving the world\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d says Scott Strazik, GE Vernova CEO. \u201cThrough this alliance, we are proud to be able to help drive new technologies while at the same time inspire future leaders to play a meaningful role in deploying technology to improve the planet at companies like GE Vernova.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis alliance embodies the spirit of the MIT Climate Project \u2014 combining cutting-edge research, a shared drive to tackle today\u2019s toughest energy challenges, and a deep sense of optimism about what we can achieve together,\u201d says Sally Kornbluth, president of MIT. \u201cWith the combined strengths of MIT and GE Vernova, we have a unique opportunity to make transformative progress in the flagship areas of electrification, decarbonization, and renewables acceleration.\u201d\n\nThe alliance, comprising a $50 million commitment, will operate within MIT\u2019s Office of Innovation and Strategy. It will fund approximately 12 annual research projects relating to the three themes, as well as three master\u2019s student projects in MIT\u2019s Technology and Policy Program. The research projects will address challenges like developing and storing clean energy, as well as the creation of robust system architectures that help sustainable energy sources like solar, wind, advanced nuclear reactors, green hydrogen, and more compete with carbon-emitting sources.\n\nThe projects will be selected by a joint steering committee composed of representatives from MIT and GE Vernova, following an annual Institute-wide call for proposals.\n\nThe collaboration will also create approximately eight endowed GE Vernova research fellowships for MIT students, to be selected by faculty and beginning in the fall. There will also be 10 student internships that will span GE Vernova\u2019s global operations, and GE Vernova will also sponsor programming through MIT\u2019s New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET), which equips students with career-oriented experiential opportunities. Additionally, the alliance will create professional education programming for GE Vernova employees.\n\n\u201cThe internships and fellowships will be designed to bring students into our ecosystem,\u201d says GE Vernova Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Roger Martella. \u201cStudents will walk our factory floor, come to our labs, be a part of our management teams, and see how we operate as business leaders. They\u2019ll get a sense for how what they\u2019re learning in the classroom is being applied in the real world.\u201d\n\nPhilanthropic support from GE Vernova will also support projects in MIT\u2019s Human Insight Collaborative (MITHIC), which launched last fall to elevate human-centered research and teaching. The projects will allow faculty to explore how areas like energy and cybersecurity influence human behavior and experiences.\n\nIn connection with the alliance, GE Vernova is expected to join several MIT consortia and membership programs, helping foster collaborations and dialogue between industry experts and researchers and educators across campus.\n\nWith operations across more than 100 countries, GE Vernova designs, manufactures, and services technologies to generate, transfer, and store electricity with a mission to decarbonize the world. The company is headquartered in Kendall Square, right down the road from MIT, which its leaders say is not a coincidence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really good at taking proven technologies and commercializing them and scaling them up through our labs,\u201d Martella says. \u201cMIT excels at coming up with those ideas and being a sort of time machine that thinks outside the box to create the future. That\u2019s why this such a great fit: We both have a commitment to research, innovation, and technology.\u201d\n\nThe alliance is the latest in MIT\u2019s rapidly growing portfolio of research and innovation initiatives around sustainable energy systems, which also includes the Climate Project at MIT. Separate from, but complementary to, the MIT-GE Vernova Alliance, the Climate Project is a campus-wide effort to develop technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to some of the toughest problems impeding an effective global climate response.",

            "content": "HUDSON VALLEY, NY \u2013 Senators Michelle Hinchey and Rob Rolison sent a bipartisan letter, signed by 28 of their State Senate colleagues, to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Regional Administrator Mike Martucci, urging the EPA to declare that further PCB clean-up in the upper Hudson River is necessary. They\u2019ve requested the EPA declare a \u2018not protective\u2019 determination as part of its current five-year report, including committing to a clear timeline for a full Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study. The study would assess the full extent of PCB contamination in the lower Hudson's sediments, water, and wildlife\u2014a portion that has been severely overlooked.\n\n\n\nOver the course of more than 30 years, General Electric (GE) discharged more than 1.3 million pounds of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson River, transforming a 200-mile stretch of the river into one of the largest Superfund sites in the nation. GE\u2019s mandated cleanup of its pollution ended in 2015, but data consistently shows that current measures do not sufficiently protect human health and the environment, demonstrating the urgency of continued remediation.\n\n\n\nSenator Michelle Hinchey said, \u201cGeneral Electric dumped toxic chemicals into our Hudson River for decades, and it\u2019s an injustice of epic proportions that this billion-dollar corporation is still to this day allowed to sidestep responsibility. Full remediation falls squarely on the polluter, not the Hudson Valley and not our Environmental Justice communities. The EPA must mandate General Electric to immediately resume clean-up and restore the health of our Hudson River.\u201d\n\n\n\nSenator Rob Rolison said, \u201cThe Hudson River is the backbone of our region\u2019s economy and environment, yet PCB contamination continues to jeopardize public health, waterfront development, and economic opportunities for our communities along the river. This isn\u2019t just about cleanup, it\u2019s about restoring a river that the people and businesses that rely on the river can live, work, and play in safely and every year of inaction holds back economic growth, public health, and recreational access. The EPA must step up now to ensure a full cleanup, so the Hudson can be a thriving resource for all who depend on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe scientific evidence is clear, the Hudson River PCB cleanup is failing to protect public health and the environment. Every day of inaction allows these toxic chemicals to continue harming our communities, our waters, our wildlife, and our economy,\u201d said Tracy Brown, President of Riverkeeper. \u201cThe Hudson is a vital resource for millions of New Yorkers, yet lingering PCB 'forever chemical\u2019 contamination continues to limit its potential. The EPA must take stronger action to address PCB pollution across the entire Superfund Site, including the Lower Hudson River and the Upper Hudson River floodplains. We stand with our state legislators in calling on the EPA to take immediate and decisive action to hold polluters accountable and restore the Hudson to a truly healthy and thriving state.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cScenic Hudson thanks Senators Hinchey and Rolison for their leadership in requesting that EPA take long overdue actions at the Hudson River Superfund Site. EPA has the data it needs to acknowledge that the cleanup has failed to meet the fundamental Superfund standard: \u2018protective of human health and the environment,\u2019\u201d said Scenic Hudson President Ned Sullivan. \"We ask EPA to begin work on the addendum to the Third Five-Year Review immediately, analyze the data for 2023 and 2024, and release its decision by the end of this calendar year. At this critical juncture, EPA leadership has an important opportunity to provide long-overdue relief to the millions of people and the many businesses that rely on the Hudson River.\u201d\n\nThe full text of the letter to EPA Administrator Zeldin and Region 2 Administrator Martucci can be found below:\n\nMarch 27, 2025\n\nDear Administrator Zeldin and Regional Administrator Martucci,\n\nAs members of the New York State Senate, we urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formally acknowledge that the cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the upper Hudson River\u2014from Hudson Falls, NY to Troy, NY\u2014is failing to protect human health and the environment.\n\nIn January 2025, the EPA released its third five-year review report on the Hudson River PCB Superfund site (the FYR). The FYR concludes that a protectiveness determination for the upper Hudson River cleanup cannot be made until additional fish and sediment data is collected and analyzed. We strongly disagree. The EPA has ample scientific evidence to determine that the cleanup is not functioning as intended and is falling short of its original goals. As the newly-confirmed EPA Administrator\u2014and as a fellow New Yorker\u2014we urge you to take immediate action by issuing an addendum to the FYR that explicitly states that the cleanup is not protective of human health and the environment.\n\nThe continued presence of PCBs discharged by General Electric poses a significant and ongoing threat. These toxic compounds persist at dangerous levels throughout the Hudson River ecosystem\u2014in soils and sediments within the river and the surrounding floodplains, in the tissues of wildlife, and in the river itself. For nearly seventy years, our constituents have borne the burden of living near a Superfund site, suffering the public health and economic consequences of PCB contamination.\n\nThe Hudson River is one of New York\u2019s most vital natural and economic resources. From the foothills of the Adirondacks to New York Harbor, the river serves as a corridor where diverse localities, industries, and ecosystems intersect. Its scenic beauty and ecological health are essential to the prosperity of the many communities that rely on it. As state legislators, we have worked tirelessly to revitalize the Hudson Valley through legislation and budgetary investments, but those efforts are continually undermined by lingering PCB contamination.\n\nThe failure to fully remediate the Hudson River jeopardizes not only public health but also economic growth. PCB pollution deters private and public investment, stifles development, and limits recreational and commercial opportunities along the waterfront. Without decisive action, these negative impacts will persist for generations.\n\nAdditionally, long-overdue action is needed in the lower Hudson River, south of Troy. The EPA must commit to a clear schedule for conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to assess the full extent of PCB contamination in the lower Hudson's sediments, water, and wildlife. Without this critical study, the EPA lacks the necessary data to take the next steps toward remediation. The communities along this 160-mile stretch of the river have waited nearly forty years for meaningful progress, while PCB pollution has continued to harm wildlife, decimate the fishing industry, deter economic activity, and endanger public health.\n\nThe time for delay is over. We respectfully call on the EPA to take the following urgent actions:\n\nImmediately initiate an addendum to the third five-year review report, recognizing that the current cleanup is not protective of human health and the environment;\n\nInitiate a full RI/FS for the lower Hudson River to assess contamination levels and evaluate necessary remediation measures;\n\nAdopt a Record of Decision for the upper Hudson River floodplain to evaluate and select cleanup approaches to address PCB contamination in the floodplain; and\n\nEnsure the Hudson River Superfund Office maintains its current staff to continue working towards a clean and healthy Hudson River.\n\nThese steps are critical to ensuring that the Hudson River is finally restored to a condition that protects both public health and the economic vitality of the region. We appreciate your prompt attention to this pressing matter and look forward to your leadership in advancing real solutions.\n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\nSenator Michelle Hinchey\n\n41st Senate District\n\nSenator Rob Rolison\n\n39th Senate District\n\n\n\nHinchey and Rolison\u2019s letter was signed by:\n\n\n\nSenator James Skoufis (D-SD42)\n\nSenator Monica R.

            "content": "(Read Lee Iacocca\u2019s Britannica entry on Chrysler.)\n\nNardelli served in the Reserve Officers Training Corp while earning a B.S. (1971) in business. After graduation he joined General Electric (GE), where his father had worked as an engineer and middle manager. While working at GE, Nardelli earned an M.B.A. (1975) from the University of Louisville, in Kentucky. By 1988 he had become a company vice president, but when GE failed to move him into a general management position, he left to take a position as a division leader with Case Equipment Co. He returned to GE as the head (1991\u201392) of its appliance-manufacturing subsidiary in Canada and then held the top jobs at GE Transportation Systems (1992\u201395) and GE Power Systems (1995\u20132000); under his leadership GE Power Systems\u2019 sales grew from $5 billion to $20 billion.\n\nAlthough it appeared Nardelli had become a leading contender for the job that he had spent his career pursuing\u2014the CEO of GE\u2014he was passed over for that job in November 2000. Within one week he was offered the CEO position at the home-improvement superstore Home Depot\u2014a company growing so rapidly that its board of directors welcomed the structure and fiscal discipline that the GE alumnus would bring. Nardelli reduced costs, revamped purchasing systems, upgraded communications and information-technology infrastructure, and opened numerous stores. He lacked a background in retail management, however, and some of his initiatives drove customers away. Rivals cut into Home Depot\u2019s market share, and as the company\u2019s competitors increased in value, Home Depot\u2019s value sank. Nardelli became increasingly unpopular, and in 2007 he resigned in order to become CEO of Chrysler, which was owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Some analysts (and shareholders) sharply criticized his $210-million severance package.\n\nAfter taking the helm at Chrysler, Nardelli selected his new management team, luring the head of Toyota\u2019s North American operations to lead sales and marketing. Chrysler weathered a brief labour strike in October 2007, put several large pieces of property on the block to generate an expected $1 billion in cash, and began eliminating weaker vehicle models while laying off thousands of workers in North America. Despite Nardelli\u2019s hopes to turn the struggling firm into a profitable car manufacturer, Chrysler\u2019s sales continued to show declines in 2008, and at the end of the year the company received a government loan from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). After negotiations with creditors were unsuccessful, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2009. Two months later\u2014after Chrysler finalized a deal with the Italian automaker Fiat SpA that created a new company, Chrysler Group LLC\u2014Nardelli stepped down as CEO.\n\nNardelli continued to work for Cerberus, serving in various capacities. In 2010 he became CEO of Freedom Group, a holding company that specialized in firearms and was owned by Cerberus. Two years later he resigned as CEO and stepped down from his management positions at Cerberus.",

And GM is reportedly offering tens of thousands of dollars in rebates on the largest model.\n\nThe struggles come less than a year after GM folded the commercial vans into its Chevrolet brand in a bid to boost its performance as GM tries to gain ground against competitors, including Ford and Rivian, in the electric van space.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights, said the extended range of BrightDrop vans far surpasses its market competitors \u2014 but so does its price tag. Before incentives, the vehicles cost about $74,000. Ford's E-Transit van with extended battery range, for example, is $51,600 \u2014 more than $20,000 cheaper \u2014 even before applying incentives.\n\n\u201cThere is a market for electric vans,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cJust not at that price point.\u201d\n\nA Free Press photographer captured images last week of hundreds of vehicles lining a Flint, Michigan storage lot. Reuters published similar photos from CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario.\n\nGeneral Motors innovation: GM partners with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia on AI, self-driving\n\nThe cause is low demand, according to a union official, as GM has struggled to sell its electric commercial vehicles in the U.S.\n\nChevrolet, the brand under which BrightDrop is now sold in the U.S., is reportedly offering rebates that add up to a 40% discount on the larger van.\n\nGM produces BrightDrop vehicles at Canada\u2019s \u2014 and GM\u2019s \u2014 first full-scale all-electric vehicle manufacturing plant, which required massive investment to retool for EV production, including funding support from both governments.\n\nHeavy rebates offered this year\n\nCAMI Assembly closed during a scheduled two-week shutdown to \u201calign production schedules and balance inventory,\u201d a GM spokesperson said in a statement. Production restarted last week.\n\nRepresentatives at Unifor Local 88 said the BrightDrop vehicles in Flint had always been slated for the U.S. market and have nothing to do with President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats. Their rapid appearance is due to refining border-crossing transportation to include shipments by rail. If the vehicles remain in Flint, one union official said, it's likely because dealers aren't buying them.\n\nBrightDrop's sales figures fall far short of its immediate competitors. GM sold 1,529 BrightDrop commercial electric vans in the U.S. last year, compared with Ford's 12,610 E-Transit vehicles and Rivian's 13,243 EDV. BrightDrop does, however, outsell Mercedes-Benz, which sold only 828 eSprinter vans in the U.S. last year.\n\nAccording to a bulletin that CarsDirect said was sent to dealers, 2025 BrightDrop incentives surged on Feb.24,. Through June 30, the BrightDrop 400 and BrightDrop 600 are available with $25,500 purchase rebates throughout the country as part of the 2025MY BrightDrop Consumer Cash Program.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, these savings appear to be stackable, bringing up to $31,000 in potential savings,\u201d CarsDirect reported.\n\nGeneral Motors said in a statement that it remains committed to the success of Chevrolet BrightDrop, \u201cand we remain optimistic about its future.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustomers continue to add BrightDrop products to their fleet thanks to its best-in-class available range and complete suite of driver safety solutions,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe company this week hired a new vice president to oversee GM Envolve, its fleet and commercial business software platform. Ian Hucker, who was previously with GM, most recently was chief commercial officer for Hyundai Capital Europe.\n\nSince consolidating BrightDrop under the Chevrolet name, GM has more than 340 dealers selling the commercial vans, up from seven BrightDrop-specific dealers. Chevrolet BrightDrop has more than 250 unique commercial customers, the spokesperson also said, and \u201cwe continue to earn new ones regularly.\u201d\n\nLong range means big expense\n\nBrightDrop's superior range is what pushes prices above the others. Ford\u2019s vehicle has about 140 miles at full charge, and Rivian\u2019s is slightly higher. The BrightDrop van goes nearly double the distance, at 272 miles with maximum range battery pack and all-wheel drive.\n\nBut industry experts say long range isn't enough enticement for buyers to forget about added cost. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Wall Street last month retail customers already demonstrate they won\u2019t pay a premium for large EVs, making them \u201ca really tough business case given the expense of the batteries.\u201d\n\nWithout naming names, Farley said some of Ford's competitors continue to bring expensive EVs to the market \u201cthat are not going to work.\u201d\n\nCost concerns hit fleet customers more than a traditional retail customer, and paying more for a bigger battery may not seem prudent as work and delivery vans tend to travel fewer than 70 miles a day, Abuelsamid said. About 60% of Ford's fleet customers return to corporate lots or garages at night where they can recharge for the next day\u2019s driving, he said, making larger batteries with long ranges less important.\n\nProducing vans that can be configured to meet different customer needs is another driver of Ford's success. The E-Transit, for example, has \u201cmore configurations than any other all-electric commercial van from a full-line automaker, offering two lengths, three roof heights, three body styles and up to 487 cubic feet of cargo volume,\u201d according to the company's website.\n\nGM launched BrightDrop in 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary with expectations its revenue would top $10 billion by 2030 with low-20% profit margins. BrightDrop offers two commercial electric delivery vehicles: the Zevo 600, which resembles a UPS-style truck, and a smaller EV410 midsize truck.\n\nThe automaker made an $800 million investment to convert the CAMI Assembly to an EV factory to build the vans \u2014 a factory that previously made 300,000 Equinox vehicles per year, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions. Adding Chevrolet to the BrightDrop name hasn\u2019t improved sales, either.\n\nAutomotive industry: GM car buyers most loyal in 2024; Ford wins pickup and SUV categories\n\n\u201cBrightDrop has to establish itself as a brand and a source of these products. It\u2019s a whole new network that you have to build, where Chevrolet is established and knows the market,\u201d Fiorani said.\n\nUsing electric vehicles for stop-and-go delivery usage is practical and amounts to significant cost savings from gas-powered vehicles. BrightDrop's EVs can save a fleet $10,000 to $12,000 per vehicle each year, the company said.\n\nBrightDrop CEO Travis Katz said in 2022 that the company expected to be making 50,000 trucks a year starting in 2025 and bring in \u201ca lot of revenue.\u201d\n\nKatz left the company in late 2023 without specifying why as GM began reorganizing BrightDrop to function less independently and reduce costs.\n\n\u201cGM was going down the path that the corporation laid out for a market they anticipated to go heavily into electric vehicles. They are way ahead of the curve at the moment, and sales aren\u2019t meeting them there. Are GM executives anticipating 70,000 or 80,000 BrightDrop sales to break even, or can they work toward producing 10,000 a year?\u201d Fiorani said. \u201cThat\u2019s a much more practical number for this type of vehicle than the sales you see from the Express.\u201d\n\nCAMI's future\n\nIt's unclear what low BrightDrop sales in the U.S. could mean for the future of CAMI, a question complicated by possible loss of U.S. tax incentives and the potential for tariffs adding additional expense to these vehicles, Abuelsamid said.\n\nIf Trump successfully reverses aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law on Aug. 16, 2022, to provide up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs through 2032, then costs for all EVs, not just fleet, will rise, and make importing these types of vehicles less enticing.\n\nMeanwhile, community members in Ingersoll expressed concern over job stability in the current landscape, with the plant\u2019s 1,300 employees comprising a significant chunk of the area's roughly 11,000 residents.\n\n\u201cCAMI is the biggest employer in town and thousands of spinoff jobs across the region are attached to its future,\u201d read a report from the London Free Press ahead of the planned shutdown. The paper also reported auto and auto parts plants could shut down within a week of U.S. tariffs being imposed.\n\nStill, General Motors has deep ties to Canada that go back almost a century and would not move out of the country lightly. Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian Business History at the University of Toronto, said that walking away from the major investments GM has made in the country just to start from scratch stateside would be lunacy.\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling in the industry \u2014 and on Wall Street \u2014 that (Trump) wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Anastakis said. \u201cNo sane individual would bring down their own industry in this way. The uncertainty he is causing is going to impact Canada, but not in the way that he wants it. And it\u2019s going to hit Americans just as hard.\u201d\n\nMove to Michigan?\n\nGM CFO Paul Jacobson hinted that the company\u2019s playbook to manage tariffs could entail moving production back to the U.S. in its earnings call and other recent public appearances.\n\n\u201cThere's plays that we can do on that perspective to minimize the impact if there are tariffs either on Canada or Mexico,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cWe're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull.\u201d\n\nThose plans weren\u2019t meant to move forward, he said, until a permanent level of tariffs seemed unavoidable.\n\nIn total, Ingersoll-based companies in 2022 exported about $2.1 billion worth of goods. About $1.4 billion of that came from auto, food processing, defense, packaging and other advanced manufacturing, according to Lightcast, a labor market analytics company.\n\nRetooling a plant for EV production is costly and time-consuming, yet it\u2019s not as though GM doesn\u2019t have another option \u2014 and in Michigan, no less.\n\n\u201cThey could conceivably build these at Factory Zero,\u201d Abuelsamid said.\n\nFree Press staff writer Jamie LaReau contributed to this report.\n\nJackie Charniga covers General Motors for the Free Press.

So when the idea for the University of Idaho\u2019s Energy Institute arose, Kumm\u2019s name was at the top of the list of candidates for the founding director. After three months in his new role, Kumm\u2019s excitement to build programs for students and relationships with U of I partners hasn\u2019t dimmed. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool entrepreneurship opportunity to build the Energy Institute,\u201d said Kumm. \u201cWe have a huge team supporting this and everyone is on board with the ideas. We want to teach students more about the energy economy, build additional research in energy areas and engage with external partners, have conversations about their needs and the ways they would like to participate with us.\u201d As a U of I electrical engineering student in the 1980s, Kumm dreamed of building airplanes, but with limited job prospects in aeronautics, he took a job at \u2014 what was at the time \u2014 a small startup in Pullman called Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). \u201cI had no idea the risk I was taking working for a new company, but it set me on an entirely different course and worked out great,\u201d Kumm said. \u201cHelping provide a resource like electricity that is fundamental to the way we live \u2014 whether it\u2019s education, health care, entertainment, communications or work \u2014 I get to help with that and it\u2019s a thrill.\u201d He ventured out on his own to found System Protection Services in 1999 and then spent more than 17 years at POWER Engineers after POWER acquired his firm. Now at the U of I, Kumm is developing an energy certificate program, new courses and eventually degrees to bolster the energy industry workforce. He\u2019s looking at ways to use the campus community as a living laboratory for research on energy opportunities. While he is housed in the College of Engineering, Kumm is working with a wide range of campus partners. For instance, he foresees partnering with students and faculty members in the College of Art and Architecture to improve energy efficiency in campus buildings. And he\u2019s already engaged with the College of Natural Resources on a project with Portland General Electric to mitigate wildfire ignition risk. Kumm is putting together an energy industry advisory board to provide advice, advocacy and project development ideas. While building on relationships with Idaho National Laboratory, Avista, Idaho Power, SEL, POWER Engineers, and other companies, Kumm hopes to develop a network of faculty members and professionals that can solve problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed great relationships and we want to work with other industry areas at the university to meet their needs,\u201d Kumm said. \u201cIn my career I\u2019ve found that good things happen when you find people with things in common and you make those connections.\u201d We\u2019re excited to launch the U of I Energy Institute to serve as a hub for research, education and practical problem solving in a sector that is critical to our state. Kumm\u2019s experience, expertise and passion are a tremendous asset as we aim to increase energy literacy and grow the workforce needed for Idaho\u2019s energy future.",

With more than 950 fish passed upstream of Round Butte Dam, the Upper Deschutes Basin is now home to more steelhead than at any time since the 1960s. Scientists attribute this year\u2019s returns to beneficial ocean conditions and improvements in fish management practices.\n\nThe Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs (the Tribes) and Portland General Electric \u2013 co-owners of the three-dam Pelton Round Butte hydropower complex \u2013 began an ambitious effort in 2010 to reintroduce ocean-going salmon and steelhead to the Deschutes River after more than 50 years without passage for these species. Scientific modeling completed in the 1990s established an annual goal of 955 steelhead adults upstream, based on the available habitat for fish.\n\n\u201cWhile the return of steelhead fish to the watershed marks a significant milestone, the journey toward full restoration continues,\u201d said Austin Smith Jr., natural resources manager for the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. \u201cThe Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs remain committed to ongoing conservation efforts, adaptive management, and education.\u201d\n\nOf the 950 adult steelhead passed upstream, 675 traveled through Pelton Round Butte\u2019s fish collection facility as juveniles. Young fish from the Upper Deschutes, Crooked, and Metolius Rivers are collected in Lake Billy Chinook at the Selective Water Withdrawal (SWW), a structure that enables fish to be safely transported around three dams to continue their migration to the ocean. The SWW also facilitates more natural conditions in the Lower Deschutes River by reducing temperature impacts from the dams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to welcome these steelhead back to the Upper Deschutes Basin. Their journey is remarkable,\u201d said Megan Hill, senior environmental science manager at PGE. \u201cMost of these fish passed through the SWW, traveled 100 miles down the Deschutes to the Columbia River, then migrated another 200 miles past Bonneville Dam to the ocean. After spending about two years at sea, they made the 300-mile journey back. This year\u2019s run highlights the power of strong ocean conditions combined with our collaborative efforts to improve fish passage and reintroduction strategies.\u201d\n\nSteelhead released upstream of Round Butte Dam since the reintroduction program began. Totals include reintroduction fish as well as excess hatchery broodstock.\n\nMost of the returning steelhead traveled through the SWW as juveniles in 2022, a record-breaking year for juvenile collection. Since 2010, the Tribes and PGE have improved their ability to safely capture more fish through science-based strategies. These include the installation of a net that guides fish toward the collection area, a new stress-relief pond to allow fish time to recover after handling, and collaboration with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in the practice of smolt acclimation: holding young fish in-stream for a period of time to imprint and adjust to the river\u2019s conditions.\n\nAdditionally, with more than two thirds of the steelhead lifecycle spent in the Pacific, recent beneficial ocean conditions likely played a significant role in steelhead survival and return rates.\n\nIn addition to the 675 reintroduction program fish, 275 Deschutes River hatchery-origin steelhead were also released upstream \u2013 a reintroduction strategy adopted in recent years. These adults, referred to as excess broodstock, are screened for disease, monitored post-release, and are genetically identical to the other steelhead from the upper basin.\n\nConservation organizations and agencies celebrate the record steelhead run:\n\n\u201cThe DRC and its partners have been working over the last 15 years to restore streamflow and improve habitat in the Crooked River, Whychus Creek, and Metolius system to benefit these fish coming home. This marks the largest return since the efforts to reintroduce fish above the Pelton Round Butte Dam Complex began, and shows the promise of restoring anadromous runs back to their home waters in the upper basin.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Kate Fitzpatrick, executive director for the Deschutes River Conservancy\n\n\u201cThe steelhead return to the Upper Deschutes Basin during the 2024-2025 run has been much stronger than we anticipated, and we are seeing evidence of widespread spawning. The adaptive management changes we\u2019ve made in the reintroduction program have undoubtedly contributed to this strong return. Additional factors such as favorable ocean conditions and freshwater migration conditions also play a significant role.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Terry Shrader, Pelton Round Butte mitigation coordinator for Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s large return of adult steelhead from the reintroduction program has been exciting to see, and a tremendous amount of work has been expended to make this happen. NOAA Fisheries appreciates the conservation efforts of the Deschutes River Conservancy, Deschutes Land Trust, local watershed councils, and irrigation districts. The Bureau of Reclamation has also been a great partner by storing and releasing water to assist with reintroduction. PGE and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs have made improvements to their operations and collection facility, resulting in many more juvenile salmon and steelhead being passed downstream. Additionally, adjustments by the Tribes and the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife have contributed to larger numbers of juveniles being passed downstream. We look forward to ongoing collaboration and more salmon and steelhead adults returning to the Deschutes River.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Scott Carlon, fish biologist for NOAA Fisheries\n\nUsing radio tracking technology, biologists will continue to monitor the adult steelhead released upstream to gather data about their movement and spawning activity. A subset of the adults, known as kelts, will travel through the SWW and to the ocean a second time. Others will remain in the upper basin to lay their eggs in gravel nests called redds, which have already been discovered in the Upper Deschutes Basin. In a few years, the offspring of these adults will begin their own journey to the ocean, following the current downstream to start the cycle over again.\n\nMore information about the Deschutes fish reintroduction program can be found at portlandgeneral.com/healthydeschutes.\n\nAbout the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs\n\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon is a federally-recognized, sovereign Indian tribe, representing the Wasco, Warm Springs and Paiute peoples. The Tribes occupy the Warm Springs Reservation, which stretches from the summits of the Cascade Mountains to the cliffs of the Deschutes River in Central Oregon. The Reservation is reserved for the Tribes\u2019 exclusive benefit by an 1855 Treaty with the United States. To this day, the Tribes retain treaty rights across their ceded lands and usual and accustomed areas that ensure the Tribes can fish, hunt and gather its resources throughout the John Day, Hood River and the majority of the Deschutes Basin.\n\nAbout Portland General Electric Company\n\nPortland General Electric (NYSE: POR) is an integrated energy company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity to nearly 950,000 customers serving an area of 1.9 million Oregonians.

The decline aligns with broader market challenges, including inflation concerns and weaker consumer sentiment impacting major indexes. During this period, GE Vernova's involvement with RWE in Texas energy projects and its partnership with PyroGenesis reflected a focus on sustainability and emission reduction in the energy sector. These developments indicate GE Vernova's continued commitment to innovative energy solutions, yet market conditions and external economic factors might have played a role in last month's overall stock performance.\n\nNYSE:GEV Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past year, GE Vernova achieved a total shareholder return of 121.74%, significantly surpassing both the US Electrical industry, which saw a 0.5% return, and the broader US market, which returned 7.8%. This impressive performance came amid a series of key developments. The company reported an increase in full-year revenue and net income for 2024, highlighted by a net income of US$1.55 billion compared to a net loss the previous year. Additionally, GE Vernova announced a new cash dividend and completed a share buyback, which likely contributed to investor confidence and overall returns.\n\nFurther enhancing its market position, GE Vernova actively engaged in projects aligned with sustainability, demonstrated in its agreement with Tosyali for a solar power project and a collaboration with Technip Energies on the Net Zero Teesside Power project. Following its spin-off from General Electric, GE Vernova began trading on major indexes, potentially increasing its visibility and attractiveness to investors. These factors collectively played a substantial role in the company's notable stock performance over the past year.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "Mary Barra, shown in 2012, became CEO of General Motors in 2014 and has the distinction of being the first female chief executive in the automotive industry.\n\nMary Barra, n\u00e9e Mary Teresa Makela (born December 24, 1961, Waterford, Michigan), is chief executive officer (CEO) and chair of the board of General Motors Company (GM). When she was appointed CEO in 2014, Barra became the first woman to head a global automaker.\n\nEarly models had reliability issues and lacked the power and handling expected of a sports car, which hurt its reputation. GM made improvements to the Fiero during its production, but after five years on the market, the company discontinued it in 1988. Despite its short model run, the Fiero remains notable for its innovative design and as one of GM\u2019s early mid-engine experiments.\n\nAs a senior engineer at the Pontiac Fiero plant, Mary Barra gained hands-on experience in manufacturing and quality control. The Fiero, introduced in 1983 as an \u201984 model, was GM\u2019s first mass-produced mid-engine car and an ambitious attempt to blend fuel efficiency with sports car design. It featured plastic body panels over a steel frame, a lightweight structure that was ahead of its time.\n\nGrowing up in suburban Detroit, Barra was immersed in the automotive industry from an early age. Her father worked as a skilled die maker for GM for 39 years, and the new vehicles he would occasionally bring home helped spark her early interest in engineering and the company. At age 10, she was captivated by a cousin\u2019s late-\u201960s red Chevrolet Camaro convertible, later describing it as \u201ca beautiful, beautiful vehicle.\u201d\n\nBarra began her career with GM in 1980 at age 18. Through the company\u2019s cooperative education program, she worked while attending college, inspecting fenders and hoods at a GM plant in Pontiac, Michigan. In return, the company helped pay her tuition at General Motors Institute (now Kettering University) in Flint. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1985. She and her older brother, Paul, were the first generation of their family to attend college.\n\nAfter graduating, Barra became a senior engineer at GM\u2019s Pontiac Fiero plant. Recognizing her leadership potential, General Motors awarded her a fellowship to attend the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Barra graduated with an MBA in 1990 and returned to GM, where she led manufacturing planning.\n\nClimbing the ranks: Leadership roles at GM\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Barra headed GM\u2019s internal communications team. In 2003, she became the plant manager for the Detroit Hamtramck assembly plant. The following year, she was selected to serve as the company\u2019s executive director of vehicle manufacturing engineering, and in 2008 she advanced to the position of vice president for GM\u2019s global manufacturing engineering division.\n\nShe continued to gain experience in diverse sectors within the company, working as GM\u2019s vice president for global human resources beginning in 2009. In 2011, she returned to the product and engineering side as senior vice president of global product development, overseeing the design, engineering, program management, and quality of the company\u2019s vehicles worldwide.\n\nSales rose 13% under her leadership, earning praise from industry leaders and making her the highest-ranking woman in the automotive industry. Two years later, she was promoted to executive vice president for global product development, purchasing, and supply chain.\n\nBreaking barriers as CEO and navigating crisis\n\nBarra was named the automaker\u2019s CEO on December 10, 2013, and officially began her role January 15, 2014. At the time, Barra was just one of 23 women to head a Fortune 500 company. Her rise through the ranks of product development marked a shift from GM\u2019s tradition of appointing CEOs from its finance division.",

This approach also lets the customer avoid the additional overhead of paying for yet another synonymous third party solution (e.g. utility corporate standard tool is X, but EMS vendor only supports Y on its EMS, and DMS vendor only supports Z on the DMS) necessary to monitor threats, vulnerabilities and patches, and log security information and event management.Yes, cyber security is a moving target.

            "content": "The Gazette offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\n\nWATERLOO \u2014 Watch parties are being held around the state during the first weekend in April \u2014 and not just for the Final Four of the NCAA basketball tournaments.\n\nThis \u201cbig dance\u201d is a sure thing for everyone in the state: a coming-out party for the state\u2019s newest namesake ship.\n\nThe submarine named for the state of Iowa officially will be accepted into service at 9 a.m. Iowa time April 5 into the U.S. Navy.\n\nThat\u2019s when the commissioning ceremonies for the USS Iowa submarine, hull number SSN-797, will be held in Groton, Conn., where it was constructed. Watch parties are being held around the state, including one at the Grout Museum District\u2019s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum in Waterloo.\n\nThe Virginia-class submarine, six years in the making, was christened in June 2023 by former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack, the ship\u2019s sponsor. It was still in dry dock then but substantially completed.\n\nFormer Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack christens the Pre-Commissioning Unit Iowa in a June 2023 ceremony while the submarine was dry docked in Groton, Conn. The sub now will be commissioned April 5 into the U.S. Navy, where it officially will obtain the name of USS Iowa. (Supplied photo)\n\nWatch parties were held around the state for that event. This time, there\u2019s more than twice as many watch parties for the commissioning, said 20-year Navy veteran Tom Hudson of Des Moines, chair of the commissioning committee.\n\n\u201cWe had about a dozen for the christening two years ago and I think we\u2019re at 26 or 27 for the commissioning,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get out there quite a bit further and broader for the watch parties.\u201d Those parties were well-attended, and organizers sensed more watch parties would have been.\n\n\u201cWe knew there were whole parts of these state we just didn\u2019t have very well covered last time.\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe just made a little bit more concerted effort to get a little bit more of the nooks and crannies of the state. \u201cWe probably expect anywhere from 10-15 to maybe 20-25 per location.\u201d\n\nAlso, he said, \u201cWe also have almost 600 people from the state of Iowa who have requested tickets who plan to travel out and attend the ceremony in person.\u201d\n\nThe 2023 christening was by invitation only in the shipyard.\n\n\u201cWe have industry leaders, donors from various industries across Iowa. We have about 115-120 people in that category. And then individual private citizens, almost 500, which will be great to have such a huge showing from the state of Iowa,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike the christening, the commissioning is open to the public. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to attend. It\u2019s part of their constitutional right as a taxpayer, basically,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nAlso attending will be about 65 to 70 Navy veterans who served on the battleship USS Iowa, hull number BB-61, which served from World War II through the 1980s and now is a museum ship at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif. David Way, curator of the Battleship Iowa Museum there, said four of its staff members will attend the commissioning of the submarine.\n\nThe USS Iowa submarine is the latest of several ships named for Iowa in the nation\u2019s history. An Iowa steamship was used to transport troops in the Civil War. The battleship USS Iowa BB-4 saw service in the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the USS Iowa BB-61, \u201cThe Gray Ghost,\u201d served in World War II, Korea and in the 1980s through 1990 patrolling the Persian Gulf. The state of Iowa paid $3 million toward the BB-61\u2019s preservation before it was opened for public tours in 2012. Visiting Iowans may tour \u201cThe Gray Ghost\u201d for free by displaying an Iowa driver's license or state identification.\n\nThe Sullivan Brothers museum in Waterloo has a permanent exhibit on the BB-61, and is putting one together on its predecessor, the USS Iowa BB-4.\n\nThe submarine actually is at sea now, said Hudson, a submarine sailor for half his Navy career. \u201cIt\u2019s in the water and they\u2019re actually out to sea, completing various certifications and testing and trials. They won\u2019t get back to Groton until the very end of March, and they\u2019ve been underway since the first week of January. They\u2019ll have almost 90 days of underwater time even before the commissioning.\u201d\n\nThe crew of the Pre-Commissioning Unit Iowa stand in ranks June 16, 2023, next to their ship during a christening ceremony at General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard facility in Groton, Conn. (U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Wesley Towner)\n\nThe christening is when the ship officially gets its United States Ship, or \u201cUSS\u201d designation, and actually becomes part of the active Navy fleet, Hudson explained. \u201cIt\u2019s technically right now called \u2018PCU Iowa\u2019\u201d \u2014 or pre-commissioning unit \u2014 and \u201cthe commissioning is when the ship officially joins the fleet as an active U.S. warship.\u201d\n\nThe crew runs on board and \u201cbrings the ship to life\u201d as part of the commissioning ceremony, upon the command of ship sponsor Vilsack, Hudson explained.\n\n\u201cThe crew will be alongside the pier, they\u2019ll all be in their dress uniforms, and during the ceremony the commanding officer will read his orders, received from the admiral of submarine Atlantic fleet forces,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThe ship\u2019s executive officer will be ordered to raise the commissioning pennant to officially commission the ship.\n\n\u201cThe sponsor will yell, \u2018Captain, man your ship!\u2019 and the crew will run down the pier a short distance and along the gangway, and all assemble topside,\u201d he said. About a third of the crew will participate in that and others will have to be standing on watch inside the nuclear-powered craft. The total crew numbers about 135.\n\nKelly Sullivan, granddaughter and grandniece of the five Sullivan brothers from Iowa who died together during World War II, is part of the commissioning committee. The submarine\u2019s seal bears a shamrock in memory of the brothers and their Irish heritage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to see this coming to a close pretty soon,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nPre-commissioning events include a barbecue by Big Moe Cason of Des Moines, a U.S. Navy veteran who served on the USS Iowa BB-61\u2019s sister ship, the USS Missouri, and a post commissioning celebration will include many foods from the Iowa State Fair \u2014 including, of course, various delicacies on a stick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really just going to try to turn this thing into as much \u2018Iowa\u2019 as we can on the pier that morning,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cAbout the only thing we aren\u2019t doing is hauling out the Butter Cow.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, commissioning committee members are looking into having a butter USS Iowa submarine sculpted for the 2025 Iowa State Fair.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds will be the featured speaker for the commissioning event along with various naval officers.\n\nMore information on the ship and the commissioning may be found at ssn797.com/events.

(Chris Dehnel/Patch )\n\nSTORRS, CT \u2014 The University of Connecticut and the University of Rhode Island have been jointly awarded a five-year contract from General Dynamics and it's Electric Boat division to \"provide regional workforce development support to the Maritime Industrial Base,\" UConn officials said.\n\nThe contract will support ongoing activities and drastically expand the work of the UConn-URI Navy STEM Coalition, which, since 2017, has developed a K-16 pipeline across southern New England to encourage both the skilled trades and engineering careers needed to build submarines, officials said. The UConn-URI Navy STEM Coalition was established in 2017 through the leadership of Michael\n\nAccorsi at UConn and David Taggart at URI via funding from the Office of Naval Research. In 2021,\n\nthe program was expanded under the current leadership of Alexandra Hain at UConn and Valerie\n\nMaier-Speredelozzi at URI, through a grant from the DoDSTEM National Defense Education Program.\n\nHain and Maier-Speredelozzi will continue as the institutional leads of the ANCHOR, or Advancing Naval Careers through Higher-ed Outreach and Research contract. \"The UConn-URI Navy STEM Coalition recognizes the critical support from the ANCHOR contract,\n\nmanaged by General Dynamics Electric Boat and funded by the U.S. Navy through the Maritime\n\nIndustrial Base Program, which enables continued investment in workforce development and STEM\n\neducation\" said Erica Logan, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Maritime Industrial Base Deputy Director of Workforce.\n\n\"By working alongside URI and General Dynamics Electric Boat, we are not only advancing naval\n\nengineering and skilled trades but also inspiring a pipeline of talent to meet the demands of this vital\n\nsector,\" said UConn Engineering Dean JC Zhao. \"The coalition's efforts will have a substantial impact on southern New England and beyond, ensuring that our students and workforce are equipped to lead in submarine production and innovation for decades to come.\" Over the past three years, the coalition has steadily increased its presence across southern New England, engaging more than 13,000 students in the fundamentals of naval science and engineering. The Navy STEM Coalition's staff and engineering university student members have taught Connecticut and Rhode Island students the fundamentals of buoyancy, additive manufacturing, and the core trades essential to submarine production through more than 75 regional classroom visits and more than 20 large-scale outreach events nationwide.\n\nThe coalition has also engaged and trained dozens of teachers through programs ranging from day-long workshops to year-long residencies. Maier-Speredelozzi said, \"Inspiring undergraduates and K-12 students to pursue STEM careers is always rewarding, and we are excited to expand our outreach with K-12 teachers. When we work with\n\nteachers, we magnify the impact to include not only the students in their classes today, but also for\n\nyears to come.\"\n\nThe ANCHOR contract will enable the coalition to significantly increase activities in the region, including the development of multiple new summer programs at both campuses for K-12 students, undergraduate summer researchers, and pre-service teachers. Regarding the growth of K-12 summer programming, Hain said, \"Through targeted summer programs in engineering and skilled trades, we are committed to preparing students for careers in the submarine industrial base. By offering partial and full scholarships, along with free options, we\u2019re dedicated to inspiring and equipping the next generation of talent, breaking down barriers to ensure that a skilled workforce is ready to meet the unique demands of submarine production and innovation.\" The coalition will also offer significant funding for those already working within the industrial base to come back to either UConn or URI for graduate school in a partnership with the National Institute for Undersea Vehicle Technology, the premier fundamental research facility for submarine development in the region. \"The eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island region \u2013 which includes two public flagship research\n\nuniversities, GDEB's campuses in Groton and Quonset Point, and U.S. Navy operations in New London and Newport \u2013 is the undisputed global epicenter of submarine research, development and\n\nmanufacturing,\" URI Engineering Dean Anthony Marchese said. \"For decades, UConn and URI have\n\nresponded to the research and workforce development needs of our regional Maritime Industrial Base partners and we are proud to continue to fulfill that mission through the ANCHOR program.\" In expanding to support GDEB and the wider industrial base, the coalition will establish a comprehensive pipeline for submarine production from elementary education to graduate school, ensuring students in southern New England are supported in their path to building the future of the underwater fleet.",

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nIn the biggest development for U.S. Air Force tactical air power in more than two decades, Boeing has been announced as the winner of the service\u2019s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) \u2018fighter\u2019 initiative. As the centerpiece of the NGAD effort, the new crewed sixth-generation stealth combat jet, now designated the F-47, is set to change air combat forever, with the Air Force hoping to begin fielding it in the next decade.\n\nBoeing and Lockheed Martin had been facing off to build the NGAD combat jet, but neither company had formally confirmed it was competing. Northrop Grumman dropped out of the bidding process on its own accord to focus on other opportunities. Just the fact that the fighter component of NGAD is moving forward at all is news as the program has been put on hold for the better part of a year, with concerns over cost and relevance being examined. The Biden administration punted the program to the Trump administration due to this ongoing uncertainty.\n\nFrom the legacy of yesterday to the future of combat, your @USAirForce will continue to own the skies with the world\u2019s first 6th-generation fighter jet: the F-47. pic.twitter.com/TcFHEdEbGq \u2014 General David Allvin (@OfficialCSAF) March 21, 2025\n\nThe announcement was made personally by U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office today, alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin.\n\nThe Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for NGAD is expected to be worth approximately $20 billion, although, across the life of the program, the company is in line to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in orders. Each copy of the jet, once series production commences, has been estimated in the past to cost upwards of $300 million. That is if the original concept for the aircraft has not changed.\n\nA Lockheed Martin rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet. Lockheed Martin\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling that, while the NGAD terminology is frequently used to refer to the crewed combat jet that will be at the center of the effort, the program of the same name is a much broader initiative. As such, it includes the development of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones with high degrees of autonomy, as well as new jet engines, weapons, electronic warfare suites, sensors, networking ecosystems, battle management capabilities, and more.\n\nThe NGAD combat jet program evolved from plans for what was originally referred to as a Penetrating Counter-Air (PCA) platform, which emerged publicly in the mid-2010s. The PCA concept was an outgrowth of previous work the Air Force had done in cooperation with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). That includes the Aerospace Innovation Initiative, which was publicly announced in 2015 and produced at least one classified flying demonstrator design.\n\nIn contrast to previous fighter competitions, NGAD has been cloaked in secrecy from the outset. Indeed, for a long time, the Air Force didn\u2019t even disclose which companies were in the running for NGAD.\n\nHowever, the likely candidates were always going to be Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman \u2014 the established heavyweights in terms of U.S. combat aircraft manufacturers. As noted, Northrop Grumman removed itself from the running for NGAD in July 2023, as you can read about here. The firm is also highly focused on fulfilling the high-stakes B-21 Raider contract. The three defense contractors are understood to have flown up to three NGAD demonstrators \u2014 possibly one from each company, although this, too, is unconfirmed. The fact that a full-scale flight demonstrator for NGAD had flown at all was first revealed back in September 2020.\n\nA screen capture from a Northrop Grumman promotional video showing a rendering of an advanced combat jet concept, at left, among other aircraft. Northrop Grumman capture\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting Lockheed Martin was reportedly recently dropped from the separate competition to build the U.S. Navy\u2019s F/A-XX next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter, which is part of the service\u2019s own (and somewhat confusingly named) NGAD effort.\n\nIn contrast, Boeing has recently suffered some notable setbacks in both its commercial and defense businesses. Trump had previously slammed the company over its contract to build two new Air Force One planes, which are running behind schedule. In the context of NGAD, however, the company\u2019s entire future as a fighter-builder could be at stake. Notably, the company announced back in 2023 that it was going to shutter the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet line and indicated it would refocus in part on advanced combat jet efforts. The firm has made significant investments in its St. Louis, Missouri, facility to prepare it for sixth-generation fighter production. Boeing \u2014 alongside Northrop Grumman \u2014 is still in the running for the Navy\u2019s F/A-XX. As for tactical jet production, Boeing is currently building F-15 Advanced Eagles and the Air Force\u2019s T-7 jet trainer and will be for foreseeable future.\n\nSince pausing #NGAD, USAF has continued to fund both Boeing & Lockheed led teams in case the program is cleared to move forward. Boeing has continued to invest in advanced capabilities in anticipation of a next gen fighter award (It is a finalist on both AF and Navy programs). pic.twitter.com/5nLVpammNl \u2014 AirPower 2.0 (MIL_STD) (@AirPowerNEW1) March 21, 2025\n\nA Boeing rendering of notional U.S. Navy sixth-generation combat jets flying past an aircraft carrier. Boeing\n\nLockheed Martin is already highly active in the fighter business, with its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in production for three U.S. services and multiple foreign countries and with manufacturing of the latest Block 70/72 versions of the F-16 also ongoing. It also continues to sustain the F-22 Raptor. Its Skunk Works advanced projects division is famous for pushing the technological envelope, especially when it comes to tactical airpower-related programs.\n\nTrump\u2019s Air Force NGAD announcement comes at a time at which the president has been seeking to cut costs throughout the U.S. government, including slashing tens of billions of dollars from existing defense programs. NGAD has been a significant source of uncertainty over the past year, having been put on pause in May 2024 as the service reviewed its requirements amid concerns about the affordability of the aircraft, capability needs, and shifting priorities.\n\nUltimately, it seems the service\u2019s need for a sixth-generation fighter in a potential Indo-Pacific conflict secured the future of the program.\n\nA rendering of a notional sixth-generation combat jet refueling in flight. Lockheed Martin\n\nEnvisioned ostensibly as a successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, the NGAD combat jet was always intended to provide airpower capabilities sufficient to counter near-peer adversaries such as China and Russia. Although the fighter remains highly classified, it\u2019s widely assumed to be tailored to counter future high-end fights in the Indo-Pacific theater, in particular.\n\n\u201cWe tried a whole bunch of different options, and there was no more viable option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment,\u201d Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, director of Force Design, Integration, and Wargaming within the office of the deputy chief of staff for Air Force Futures, said earlier this month.\n\nA rendering of a notional sixth-generation crewed stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace\n\nAs such, the fighter will emphasize significant range and payload capabilities but will also boast a host of exotic features and subsystems, among them, broadband stealth, advanced electronic, and other \u2018spectral\u2019 warfare capabilities.\n\nTWZ has previously looked in detail at what kind of performance the aircraft might have in the end.\n\nOnce again, the NGAD combat jet is intended to work within a broader air combat \u2018ecosystem\u2019 \u2014 one in which CCA drones will play a critical part. The NGAD aircraft has always been envisioned as serving, in part, as a forward drone controller and otherwise operating closely together with companion drones. Reflecting the combat role of the CCAs, the Air Force recently announced new \u2018fighter drone\u2019 designations for the designs that General Atomics and Anduril are currently developing in the first phase, or Increment 1, of the CCA program. Boeing now joins these two companies as they set about completing the development of a new family of air combat systems for the Air Force.\n\nA composite rendering of the CCA designs that General Atomics (top) and Anduril (bottom) are currently developing, along with their new formal designations. General Atomics/Anduril/TWZ\n\nWhile there are still many questions to be answered about the NGAD aircraft, today\u2019s historic announcement means we do now know, at least, that the Air Force\u2019s sixth-generation stealth combat jet will be a Boeing product.\n\nStay tuned for full analysis and updates that we will post below.\n\nUPDATE: 12:18 PM EDT\u2014\n\nThe only image we have of the newly minted F-47 design shows the design from a head-on perspective. While limited in what it shows, some major features are clearly visible. Most notable are the wings.\n\nF-47 from Boeing. (USAF) Anna Moneymaker\n\nWe see a wing with a very high dihedral and downward swept tips. This immediately is reminiscent of Boeing\u2019s famed YF-118G Bird Of Prey technology demonstrator that flew clandestinely out of Area 51 in the 1990s. Another loosely similar high-dihedral design has come into the picture more recently in the form of Scaled Composites\u2019 Model 401 demonstrators. One positive aspect of this design element is that sensors and communications antennas on the bottom of the aircraft\u2019s fuselage can maintain line-of-sight to targets even when the aircraft is banking at steeper angles.\n\nThe YF-118G proved out a number of technologies, including advanced stealth and tailless design, to new breakthroughs in manufacturing and even visual stealth. It was a far lower performing machine compared to what the F-47 is set up to be, but clearly lessons learned from Bird of Prey are very much alive in Boeing\u2019s NGAD design. We will likely be hearing more about this historical linkage in the future.\n\nThere appears to be some sort of canard foreplanes visible in the image provided. These structures are usually not optimal for low-observability (stealth), although we have seen them in some artwork related to future NGAD-like concepts, especially from Boeing. Adding them would allow for better maneuverability and stability, especially for an inherently very unstable tailless design. We will have to wait and see if this feature is included in the final product or not. There is always the possibility that features are included in the concept art shown to throw off foreign intelligence.\n\nWe also see a very broad, shovel-like nose, which could house a very large radar array and a large bubble canopy. We don\u2019t know if the aircraft will feature one or two crew. We see a single nose wheel, as well. Beyond that, not much can be concluded, including the jet\u2019s inlet configuration, although the fuselage appears notably svelte, at least from this angle.\n\nUPDATE: 1:00 P.M. EDT\u2014\n\nIn the Oval Office presser today, Trump said he was \u201cthrilled to announce\u201d the NGAD fighter contract award to Boeing, describing the aircraft as \u201cthe world\u2019s first sixth-generation fighter jet.\u201d\n\nThe aircraft has received the Mission Design Series designation F-47, for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear. F-47 was previously used for the World War II-era P-47 Thunderbolt after the designation system was revised in 1947. It may simply be a happy coincidence that Trump is the 47th U.S. president.\n\nAn F-47 Thunderbolt. U.S. Air Force\n\nTrump noted that the F-47 \u201chas been in the works for a long period of time,\u201d and that the Boeing design was selected \u201cafter a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America\u2019s top aerospace companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something the likes of which nobody has seen before,\u201d Trump continued, as he outlined the F-47 in broad strokes. \u201cIn terms of all of the attributes of a fighter jet, there\u2019s never been anything even close to it, from speed to maneuverability, to what it can have to payload \u2026 The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built.\u201d\n\nTrump said he was confident that the F-47 \u201cmassively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation. There\u2019s no other nation, we know every other plane, I\u2019ve seen every one of them, and it\u2019s not even close. This is the next level.\u201d\n\nAs well as being \u201cequipped with state-of-the-art stealth technologies,\u201d which will make it \u201cvirtually unseeable,\u201d the F-47 has \u201cthe most power of any jet of its kind ever made,\u201d Trump claims. \u201cManeuverability \u2026 there\u2019s never been anything like it, despite the power and speed,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump said that the F-47\u2019s \u201cspeed is top, over two, which is something that you don\u2019t hear very often.\u201d This would seem to imply a top speed in the region of Mach 2.\n\nAccording to Trump, an experimental version of the F-47 \u201chas secretly been flying for almost five years.\u201d This is in line with the announcement of September 2020, from Dr. Will Roper, then Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, that a previously undisclosed NGAD demonstrator had begun flight testing. Since then, it\u2019s been reported that at least three NGAD-related demonstrators have flown.\n\nThe president also announced an aspiration to have the F-47 enter series production before the end of his term in office, which ends in January 2029.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already built much of what has to be built in terms of production, including the sheds,\u201d Trump said, in reference to investments in infrastructure at Boeing\u2019s St. Louis, Missouri, plant.\n\nAs for the unit cost of the new fighter, \u201cwe can\u2019t tell you the price, because it would give it would give way to some of the technology and some of the size of the plane,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Trump said that U.S. allies \u201care calling constantly\u201d with a view to obtaining an export version of the NGAD fighter. He said that the United States would be selling them to \u201ccertain allies \u2026 perhaps toned-down versions. We\u2019d like to tone them down about 10 percent which probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they\u2019re not our allies, right?\u201d\n\nHaving the F-47 cleared for export, even in a downgraded version, would be a significant difference from the F-22 stealth fighter, which the NGAD jet was originally schemed to supersede. Despite foreign interest, the F-22 was never approved for sale to other nations, due to the sensitive nature of its technologies. It will be intriguing to see how this issue would be resolved in the even more cutting-edge F-47.\n\nWatch as @POTUS, @SecDef and @OfficialCSAF share major news for the Air Force and our country! https://t.co/cdhTc4GV33 \u2014 U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) March 21, 2025\n\nAllvin, in his statement on the F-47, branded the new aircraft \u201cthe most advanced, lethal, and adaptable fighter ever developed \u2014 designed to outpace, outmaneuver, and outmatch any adversary that dares to challenge our brave airmen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAllvin also referred to a flight test campaign related to the NGAD fighter having been carried out over the past five years, noting that more than one X-plane has been involved, flying hundreds of hours.\n\n\u201cThese experimental aircraft have demonstrated the innovations necessary to mature the F-47\u2019s capabilities, ensuring that when we committed to building this fighter, we knew we were making the right investment for America,\u201d Allvin said.\n\nThis test work has apparently resulted in a fighter that is very close to the series-production configuration, which should ensure it flies in this form during Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\nThe Air Force chief also provided an interesting comparison with the F-22, stating that the F-47 will cost less and be \u201cmore adaptable to future threats.\u201d Furthermore, the Air Force will have more F-47s than the current fleet of just over 180 Raptors. Furthermore, the new fighter will have a \u201csignificantly longer range, more advanced stealth, be more sustainable, supportable, and have higher availability than our fifth-generation fighters.\u201d It will also take \u201csignificantly less manpower and infrastructure to deploy.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: 1:30 PM EDT\u2014\n\nAnother image we now have of the F-47 concept shows a very interesting and downright puzzling angle. We see that indeed this aircraft has a very broad shovel-like nose and its Bird of Prey-like wing dihedral is also apparent. The canopy looks quite wide as well and a better look at the fuselage is also seen here.\n\nThe overall design of the fuselage appears very loosely similar to Boeing\u2019s X-45 UCAV demonstrators and it also has a superficial likeness to the NASA/Boeing X-36 Tailless Fighter Agility Research Aircraft.\n\nTwo X-45A Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAV) are shown to members of the news media on July 11, 2002, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The X-45A, developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Boeing Company, is the first unmanned system designed from inception for combat missions. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) David McNew\n\nThe most puzzling part of this image is the canards, which look more like smaller forward root extensions here. We also see what appears to be a blockish intake on one side but not the other. This incongruity is curious, but as we stated earlier, the imagery could be altered in key ways to help throw off foreign intelligence.\n\nWe also have an official high-resolution image of the head-on view, which shows the canards more clearly. Here is what the Air Force said about the head-on image:\n\n\u201cShown is a graphical artist rendering of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Platform. The rendering highlights the Air Force\u2019s sixth-generation fighter, the F-47.

We are committed to advancing the state of the art in air dominance to ensure America has the most revolutionary systems to counter the rapidly evolving threat environment. While disappointed with this outcome, we are confident we delivered a competitive solution. We will await further discussions with the U.S. Air Force.\u201d\n\nThe last sentence of that statement would appear to suggest that some sort of protest against the contract award could be on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, engine manufacturer General Electric posted the following to X:\n\nA statement from GE Aerospace on today's Next Generation Air Dominance Program Announcement: pic.twitter.com/hKtt25sM7D \u2014 GE Aerospace (@GE_Aerospace) March 21, 2025\n\nEarlier this year, Air Force contracts with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney had their ceilings increased to $3.5 billion, for the companies to continue work on prototype next-generation jet engines. This is part of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, which is focused primarily on developing new engines to power the NGAD fighter. The NGAD combat jet\u2019s future is now an open question, but NGAP might also feed into other advanced aviation programs.\n\nToday\u2019s big winner is, of course, Boeing. As John Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current, notes, this is the first time that the company has won a contract for a clean-sheet jet fighter design. Otherwise, successful Boeing products in this field have been inherited from McDonnell Douglas, with which it was merged in 1997, including the F-15, AV-8B, F/A-18, and EA-18.\n\nOkay, I checked my encylopedias on my bookshelf, and Boeing's NGAD win is the first clean-sheet jet fighter awarded in its entire history. theaircurrent.com/dispatches/\u2026 \u2014 Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower.com) 2025-03-21T17:29:36.783Z\n\nSecretary of the Air Force Public Affairs has provided a few more details on where the F-47 program will go next.\n\nToday\u2019s contract award will fund the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase, which includes maturing, integrating, and testing all aspects of the F-47. This phase will produce a small number of test aircraft for evaluation, the Air Force says. The contract also includes competitively priced options for low-rate initial production.\n\nComing soon to our Air Dominance Combined Test Force! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #AFMC https://t.co/VER2YqXDbB \u2014 Edwards Air Force Base (@EdwardsAFB) March 21, 2025\n\nUPDATE: 4:00 PM EDT\u2014\n\nBoeing has issued an official statement on its award, with the following quote from Steve Parker, interim president, and chief executive officer of its Defense, Space & Security division.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of designing, building, and delivering a sixth-generation fighter capability for the United States Air Force. In preparation for this mission, we made the most significant investment in the history of our defense business, and we are ready to provide the most advanced and innovative NGAD aircraft needed to support the mission.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: 12:00 PM EDT 3-22-25\u2014\n\nA couple things to follow up with now that the initial announcement day has passed.\n\nFirst off, the DoD posted a high-resolution version of the F-47 flying render. We do see the canards oddly obscured by clouds, but they are there. Tough to say exactly what the final aircraft configuration will look like. Canards are a very interesting if not puzzling choice for many reasons, low observability being the biggest. We will be exploring this further soon. Also, as noted repeatedly above, how accurate or purposefully misleading these images are is unknown.\n\n(U.S. Air Force graphic) Secretary of the Air Force Publi\n\nShown is a graphical artist rendering of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Platform.

            "content": "General Electric (GE)\n\nIn the late 1990s, General Electric (GE), the American multinational conglomerate focusing on energy solutions, power, and healthcare technologies, embarked on an ambitious push into the growing world of e-commerce. Lloyd G. Trotter, a senior executive at the company, faced an uncomfortable truth: he had limited knowledge of the internet.\n\n\u201cI knew it existed,\u201d Trotter admitted candidly. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t exactly a frequent user.\u201d At 54, his engagement with the digital world was minimal, even for the simplest of tasks.\n\nRecognising the challenge faced by Trotter and many of his contemporaries , Jack Welch, GE\u2019s legendary CEO devised an ingenious solution: Reverse mentoring.\n\nAlthough mentoring had long been part of GE\u2019s corporate culture, this innovative scheme turned the traditional concept around. Instead of experienced veterans guiding younger employees, the reverse mentoring initiative paired younger, tech-savvy workers with senior managers.\n\nThe goal was simple but transformative\u2014to help seasoned leaders develop the digital skills needed to navigate a rapidly changing business landscape.\n\nThis forward-thinking concept, which would later gain traction with other companies, has its precedents to Welch\u2019s visionary leadership. Initially, the programme focused on bridging the technology gap, equipping senior executives with the tools to leverage the internet effectively. Over time, it evolved into a broader exercise, reshaping the way senior leaders approached strategic challenges, leadership practices, and their overall mindset.\n\nThe difficulty faced by Trotter wasn\u2019t unique to GE. Across industries, older executives were grappling with the unfamiliar terrain of the digital age. Yet they understood that staying relevant required embracing technological progress; leaders needed to adapt quickly.\n\nAs part of the reverse mentoring programme, GE\u2019s managers met regularly with their younger mentors to evaluate competitors\u2019 websites, dissect assigned reading materials, and exchange ideas. Trotter valued the collaborative approach, reflecting, \u201cWe can put our thoughts on the table, discuss them openly, and work through them together.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of the scheme extended both ways. For younger employees serving as mentors, the experience offered a rare opportunity to build confidence, interact with senior executives, and gain insight into the complexities of managing a large organisation. These dynamics created a mutually enriching environment, fostering growth and innovation at every level of the company.\n\nThis tool evolved into a powerful tool for cultural transformation, skills development, and inclusivity within the modern workplace.\n\nThrough reverse mentoring, GE not only equipped its executives for the digital era but also set a precedent for organisations striving to navigate the ever-evolving demands of modern business.\n\nRead also: General Electric proposes fastest pathway to low carbon future\n\nAbout reverse mentoring\n\nJennifer Jordan, a professor of leadership and organisational behaviour at IMD, highlights four significant advantages of such programmes in her research:\n\n\u00b7 Boosting millennial retention\n\nAt BNY Mellon\u2019s Pershing, former CEO Ron DeCicco partnered with his millennial mentor, Jamilynn Camino, to introduce \u201cfireside chats.\u201d These sessions provided a platform for DeCicco to engage with employees, address key issues, and seek feedback\u201d. Within three years, the chats became the company\u2019s most attended event, contributing to an impressive 96 percent retention rate among the first cohort of millennial mentors.\n\n\u00b7 Enhancing digital skills\n\nReverse mentoring has also been instrumental in bridging technological gaps. DeCicco, during his tenure as COO, used the guidance of his mentor to embrace social media. He became one of the firm\u2019s most active users on such platforms.\n\n\u00b7 Driving cultural change\n\nFabrizio Freda, Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s CEO acknowledged that the company\u2019s future strategies required fresh perspectives. Through their reverse-mentoring initiative, millennial mentors educated senior leaders on the role of social media influencers in shaping modern shopping experiences. The programme also gave rise to \u201cDreamspace,\u201d an internal portal for sharing ideas, with executive leaders receiving regular updates on trending topics discussed there.\n\nIn 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) launched its reverse-mentoring initiative to champion diversity and inclusion. The programme eventually paired 122 millennial mentors with 200 partners and directors across the globe, fostering cross-generational collaboration.\n\nJordan also highlights the following points which need to be considered to realise the benefits of reverse mentoring.\n\nStrategic pairing\n\nSuccessful reverse-mentoring initiatives hinge on thoughtful and strategic pairing, with matches spanning regions, departments, and even personality types. Pairing an introvert with an extrovert, for example, often yields better results than matching two introverts, according to Jordan.\n\nBefore finalising pairings, it\u2019s essential to involve mentees in the process. While younger mentors tend to be flexible, senior executive mentees often exhibit greater selectivity, cautious about potential or perceived conflicts of interest.\n\nOvercoming fear and building trust\n\nA common barrier to effective reverse mentoring is the apprehension senior executives feel about exposing their knowledge gaps to junior colleagues. However, addressing these fears openly can create a foundation of trust and lead to mutually rewarding exchanges.\n\nCommitment\n\nOne of the primary reasons reverse-mentoring programmes falter is a lack of commitment from executive mentees. When sessions are repeatedly cancelled, momentum quickly dissipates, undermining the initiative. To ensure sustainability, younger mentors are encouraged to take an active role in maintaining engagement.\n\nNgozi Ekugo Ngozi Ekugo is a Senior Labour Market Analyst and Correspondent, specializing in the research and analysis of workplace dynamics, labour market trends, immigration reports, employment law and legal cases in general.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nDuring the latest episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised his viewers to closely monitor the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and the earnings reports from companies. However, he also cautioned that irrespective of what the earnings reveal, the direction of the market will largely be determined by President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe also mentioned that Tuesday will bring the release of February housing data, which Cramer emphasized as significant. He stressed that a strong housing market is essential in preventing a recession, which he described as \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 7 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer Talked About These 7 Stocks Recently\n\n\u201cAny kind of slowdown is quickly reflected in housing, which then gets reflected in retail. It\u2019s a delicate chain that starts with housing, which is why I\u2019ll be watching these numbers like a hawk.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s events are also of importance, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee will meet, and the market will hear from Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chair. Cramer noted that the most recent inflation data, including both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index, have been relatively favorable, which might suggest that inflation is under control. However, he cautioned that certain areas of the economy still experience persistent high prices.\n\nFurthermore, as per Cramer, there is a looming possibility of a new round of tariffs, potentially as soon as next week, which could include a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, perhaps on those from Germany, Japan, and South Korea. He then added:\n\n\u201cI fear the president will choose Wednesday to lower the boom so be prepared. Sure, the market\u2019s oversold. It may stay oversold by Wednesday so it could possibly handle any auto-related tariff news, but you have to be ready for them.\u201d\n\nFinally, Cramer reiterated that the fate of the market this week will hinge more on actions from the White House and the Federal Reserve than on the earnings reports of individual companies.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 22, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 22, 2024, market close to March 14th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nPlease note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 101\n\nA caller asked Jim Cramer about his opinion on GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), referred to as General Electric at the time. Here\u2019s what he replied with:\n\n\u201cPeople are saying the stock is overextended and I totally get that; it\u2019s one of the greatest charts in the book. But because Boeing is so screwed up, people are saying give me an aerospace play, and they keep going back to GE. So I\u2019m not going to tell you to sell the stock. I can tell you can hold it if it drops down buy more. But I can\u2019t tell you to sell it, it\u2019s too good.\u201d\n\nThe stock is up by 44.29% since then.\n\nOn March 14th this year, Cramer was asked if GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) could take more share from Boeing and Cramer replied with:\n\n\u201cOh man. Okay\u2026 I think the answer is they can take a ton. They, and you have to, you have to buy it and buy it like mad because what\u2019s gonna happen is there\u2019s going to be so much servicing of these planes and that\u2019s where they make their biggest money. And don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re getting Larry Culp who\u2019s one of the greatest executives in America.\u201d\n\nOverall, GE ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of GE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

            "content": "Hyundai Motor Company and General Motors are in the final stages of a strategic agreement for Hyundai to share two electric van models with GM while rebranding and selling GM\u2019s pickup trucks in the North American market, Reuters reported on Friday.\n\nHyundai plans to produce vans for both its own brand and GM, initially importing them from South Korea and is exploring options to manufacture the vehicles in North America either by using its local plant, outsourcing production or constructing a new facility.\n\nIn exchange, GM is expected to share its midsized trucks, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, with Hyundai in the US market. Although Hyundai is also interested in selling GM\u2019s full-sized pickups -- presumably, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra \u2013 the American carmaker has excluded this option from the discussions, according to a source quoted by Reuters. As a result, the pickup arrangements are anticipated to require more time to finalize than the commercial van deal.\n\nHyundai and GM are also discussing whether Hyundai will supply compact SUVs for GM as fresh editions to its car lineup in Brazil, the source noted. Beyond vehicle-sharing, the automakers are mulling over joint purchasing or development of computing chips, next-generation batteries and battery materials.\n\n\u201cThe two companies are continuing discussions, but nothing has been decided at this time,\u201d said an official from Hyundai Motor Company\u2019s Seoul headquarters.\n\nIndustry insiders here suggest that Hyundai could leverage GM\u2019s well-established pickup lineups to expand its presence in the US, a major market for pickup trucks, while countering potential auto tariffs from the second Trump administration. GM seeks to market Hyundai\u2019s electrified models, which are gaining traction in the country.\n\n\u201cHyundai sells midsized pickup, the Santa Cruz, in the US. However, it looks to include large-sized pickups in its offerings, as they are much more popular in the market,\u201d said Kim Pil-su, a car engineering professor at Daelim University. \u201cIt would be best for the automaker to successfully negotiate the full-sized fleet with GM.\u201d\n\nThe strategic partnership between Hyundai Motor Group and GM -- the world\u2019s third- and sixth-largest automakers by sales last year, respectively -- came out last year when Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Euisun and GM CEO Mary Barra signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on key strategic areas in the global automotive industry.\n\nBy Byun Hye-jin (hyejin2@heraldcorp.com)",

And GM is reportedly offering tens of thousands of dollars in rebates on the largest model.\n\nThe struggles come less than a year after GM folded the commercial vans into its Chevrolet brand in a bid to boost its performance as GM tries to gain ground against competitors, including Ford and Rivian, in the electric van space.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights, said the extended range of BrightDrop vans far surpasses its market competitors \u2014 but so does its price tag. Before incentives, the vehicles cost about $74,000. Ford's E-Transit van with extended battery range, for example, is $51,600 \u2014 more than $20,000 cheaper \u2014 even before applying incentives.\n\n\u201cThere is a market for electric vans,\u201d Abuelsamid said. \u201cJust not at that price point.\u201d\n\nA Free Press photographer captured images last week of hundreds of vehicles lining a Flint storage lot. Reuters published similar photos from CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario.\n\nChief of Maps: GM's Dave Craig knows the road \u2014 and works to fix them\n\nMore: GM partners with Silicon Valley chip maker NVIDIA on AI, self-driving\n\nThe cause is low demand, according to a union official, as GM has struggled to sell its electric commercial vehicles in the U.S.\n\nChevrolet, the brand under which BrightDrop is now sold in the U.S., is reportedly offering rebates that add up to a 40% discount on the larger van.\n\nGM produces BrightDrop vehicles at Canada\u2019s \u2014 and GM\u2019s \u2014 first full-scale all-electric vehicle manufacturing plant, which required massive investment to retool for EV production, including funding support from both governments.\n\nHeavy rebates offered this year\n\nCAMI Assembly closed during a scheduled two-week shutdown to \u201calign production schedules and balance inventory,\u201d a GM spokesperson said in a statement. Production restarted Monday.\n\nRepresentatives at Unifor Local 88 said the BrightDrop vehicles in Flint had always been slated for the U.S. market and have nothing to do with President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats. Their rapid appearance is due to refining border-crossing transportation to include shipments by rail. If the vehicles remain in Flint, one union official said, it's likely because dealers aren't buying them.\n\nBrightDrop's sales figures fall far short of its immediate competitors. GM sold 1,529 BrightDrop commercial electric vans in the U.S. last year, compared with Ford's 12,610 E-Transit vehicles and Rivian's 13,243 EDV. BrightDrop does, however, outsell Mercedes-Benz, which sold only 828 eSprinter vans in the U.S. last year.\n\nAccording to a bulletin that CarsDirect said was sent to dealers, 2025 BrightDrop incentives surged on Feb.24,. Through June 30, the BrightDrop 400 and BrightDrop 600 are available with $25,500 purchase rebates throughout the country as part of the 2025MY BrightDrop Consumer Cash Program.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, these savings appear to be stackable, bringing up to $31,000 in potential savings,\u201d CarsDirect reported.\n\nGeneral Motors said in a statement that it remains committed to the success of Chevrolet BrightDrop, \u201cand we remain optimistic about its future.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustomers continue to add BrightDrop products to their fleet thanks to its best-in-class available range and complete suite of driver safety solutions,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe company this week hired a new vice president to oversee GM Envolve, its fleet and commercial business software platform. Ian Hucker, who was previously with GM, most recently was chief commercial officer for Hyundai Capital Europe.\n\nSince consolidating BrightDrop under the Chevrolet name, GM has more than 340 dealers selling the commercial vans, up from seven BrightDrop-specific dealers. Chevrolet BrightDrop has more than 250 unique commercial customers, the spokesperson also said, and \u201cwe continue to earn new ones regularly.\u201d\n\nLong range means big expense\n\nBrightDrop's superior range is what pushes prices above the others. Ford\u2019s vehicle has about 140 miles at full charge, and Rivian\u2019s is slightly higher. The BrightDrop van goes nearly double the distance, at 272 miles with maximum range battery pack and all-wheel drive.\n\nBut industry experts say long range isn't enough enticement for buyers to forget about added cost. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Wall Street last month retail customers already demonstrate they won\u2019t pay a premium for large EVs, making them \u201ca really tough business case given the expense of the batteries.\u201d\n\nWithout naming names, Farley said some of Ford's competitors continue to bring expensive EVs to the market \u201cthat are not going to work.\u201d\n\nCost concerns hit fleet customers more than a traditional retail customer, and paying more for a bigger battery may not seem prudent as work and delivery vans tend to travel fewer than 70 miles a day, Abuelsamid said. About 60% of Ford's fleet customers return to corporate lots or garages at night where they can recharge for the next day\u2019s driving, he said, making larger batteries with long ranges less important.\n\nProducing vans that can be configured to meet different customer needs is another driver of Ford's success. The E-Transit, for example, has \u201cmore configurations than any other all-electric commercial van from a full-line automaker, offering two lengths, three roof heights, three body styles and up to 487 cubic feet of cargo volume,\u201d according to the company's website.\n\nGM launched BrightDrop in 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary with expectations its revenue would top $10 billion by 2030 with low-20% profit margins. BrightDrop offers two commercial electric delivery vehicles: the Zevo 600, which resembles a UPS-style truck, and a smaller EV410 midsize truck.\n\nThe automaker made an $800 million investment to convert the CAMI Assembly to an EV factory to build the vans \u2014 a factory that previously made 300,000 Equinox vehicles per year, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions. Adding Chevrolet to the BrightDrop name hasn\u2019t improved sales, either.\n\n\u201cBrightDrop has to establish itself as a brand and a source of these products. It\u2019s a whole new network that you have to build, where Chevrolet is established and knows the market,\u201d Fiorani said.\n\nUsing electric vehicles for stop-and-go delivery usage is practical and amounts to significant cost savings from gas-powered vehicles. BrightDrop's EVs can save a fleet $10,000 to $12,000 per vehicle each year, the company said.\n\nBrightDrop CEO Travis Katz said in 2022 that the company expected to be making 50,000 trucks a year starting in 2025 and bring in \u201ca lot of revenue.\u201d\n\nKatz left the company in late 2023 without specifying why as GM began reorganizing BrightDrop to function less independently and reduce costs.\n\n\u201cGM was going down the path that the corporation laid out for a market they anticipated to go heavily into electric vehicles. They are way ahead of the curve at the moment, and sales aren\u2019t meeting them there. Are GM executives anticipating 70,000 or 80,000 BrightDrop sales to break even, or can they work toward producing 10,000 a year?\u201d Fiorani said. \u201cThat\u2019s a much more practical number for this type of vehicle than the sales you see from the Express.\u201d\n\nCAMI's future\n\nIt's unclear what low BrightDrop sales in the U.S. could mean for the future of CAMI, a question complicated by possible loss of U.S. tax incentives and the potential for tariffs adding additional expense to these vehicles, Abuelsamid said.\n\nIf Trump successfully reverses aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law on Aug. 16, 2022, to provide up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs through 2032, then costs for all EVs, not just fleet, will rise, and make importing these types of vehicles less enticing.\n\nMeanwhile, community members in Ingersoll expressed concern over job stability in the current landscape, with the plant\u2019s 1,300 employees comprising a significant chunk of the area's roughly 11,000 residents.\n\n\u201cCAMI is the biggest employer in town and thousands of spinoff jobs across the region are attached to its future,\u201d read a report from the London Free Press ahead of the planned shutdown. The paper also reported auto and auto parts plants could shut down within a week of U.S. tariffs being imposed.\n\nStill, General Motors has deep ties to Canada that go back almost a century and would not move out of the country lightly. Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian Business History at the University of Toronto, said that walking away from the major investments GM has made in the country just to start from scratch stateside would be lunacy.\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling in the industry \u2014 and on Wall Street \u2014 that (Trump) wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Anastakis said. \u201cNo sane individual would bring down their own industry in this way. The uncertainty he is causing is going to impact Canada, but not in the way that he wants it. And it\u2019s going to hit Americans just as hard.\u201d\n\nMove to Michigan?\n\nGM CFO Paul Jacobson hinted that the company\u2019s playbook to manage tariffs could entail moving production back to the U.S. in its earnings call and other recent public appearances.\n\n\u201cThere's plays that we can do on that perspective to minimize the impact if there are tariffs either on Canada or Mexico,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cWe're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull.\u201d\n\nThose plans weren\u2019t meant to move forward, he said, until a permanent level of tariffs seemed unavoidable.\n\nIn total, Ingersoll-based companies in 2022 exported about $2.1 billion worth of goods. About $1.4 billion of that came from auto, food processing, defense, packaging and other advanced manufacturing, according to Lightcast, a labor market analytics company.\n\nRetooling a plant for EV production is costly and time-consuming, yet it\u2019s not as though GM doesn\u2019t have another option \u2014 and in Michigan, no less.\n\n\u201cThey could conceivably build these at Factory Zero,\u201d Abuelsamid said.\n\nFree Press staff writer Jamie LaReau contributed to this report.\n\nJackie Charniga covers General Motors for the Free Press.

So we would like Democrats to also come out and condemn this heinous violence that we have seen,\" Leavitt said.\n\nThe statements from Bondi and Leavitt came after the latest incident in which five Tesla vehicles were damaged when a fire was started at a Tesla Collision Center in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. That was the latest in a wave of incidents aimed at the electric vehicle company, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n\"This was a targeted attack against a Tesla facility,\" said Dori Koren, assistant sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nAlong with the burning vehicles, officials said the word \"RESIST\" was spray-painted across the doors of the facility and three rounds of shots were fired at the additional Teslas. The suspect approached the business wearing black clothing and is believed to have used Molotov cocktails and a firearm to conduct his attack, police said.\n\nOfficials received notice that an individual had \"set several vehicles on fire in the parking lot and caused damage to the property.\"\n\nPolice and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating this incident, which they believe was an isolated attack. Authorities are still searching for a suspect.\n\nA grab from a video released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department shows the word \"RESIST\" on the doors of a Tesla facility. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\n\nTwo Tesla Cybertrucks also caught on fire at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening, according to the Kansas City Police Department.\n\nTesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been vandalized, suffered arson and faced protests in recent weeks since the company's CEO Elon Musk began his work at the White House spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nIn the statement Tuesday, Bondi said, \"The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" In some of the cases, she said the Justice Department is charging perpetrators with crimes that carry five-year mandatory minimum sentences.\n\n\"We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" she said in the statement.\n\nIn the Kansas incident, a police officer in the area spotted smoke coming from one Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership on State Line Road shortly before midnight. The officer attempted to put out the flames using a fire extinguisher, but the fire spread to a second Cybertruck parked next to the original one, police said.\n\nThe Kansas City Fire Department ordered the bomb and arson unit to assist on the scene, the fire department said. Officials were able to put out the flames and the vehicles were \"covered with a fire blanket to prevent reignition,\" the fire department said.\n\n\"The circumstances are under investigation but preliminarily the fire is being investigated for the potential of being an arson,\" police said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThere have been no arrests made for this incident, police said. The FBI is assisting the Kansas City Police Department in this investigation.\n\nThis follows a spree of similar incidents that have occurred across the country in the last few weeks.\n\nLast week, \"more than a dozen\" shots were fired at a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon, according to Kelsey Anderson, the public information officer at the Tigard Police Department.\n\nAdditionally, three Teslas were vandalized in Dedham, Massachusetts on March 11, according to the Dedham Police Department. Officials said \"words had been spray-painted\" on two Tesla Cybertrucks, with all four tires of the trucks and a Tesla Model S being \"reportedly damaged.\"\n\nChalk graffiti is displayed on the outside of a Tesla dealership during a rally in San Francisco, March 15, 2025.

Just over 1,000 were built, and the cars were only available for lease in a few states.\n\nHere in Los Angeles: You can see one of only 40 EV1s still intact at the Petersen Automotive Museum.\n\nWhy it matters: GM built just over 1,000 EV1s before ending production in 1999, spawning a community of passionate super fans eager to join the EV revolution. But the EV1 was controversial, and short-lived. Many Americans never knew the EV1 existed \u2014 and the fight to keep it alive ended with GM crushing nearly all the cars into scrap.\n\nThe backstory: The EV1's origins can be traced to 1990, when California passed sweeping regulations aimed at curbing the state's air pollution. The plan mandated automakers build zero-emission vehicles. By 1996, General Motors EV1 hit the market.\n\nRead the full story\n\nIt was the most reliable car he had ever driven \u2014 that's how Kris Trexler remembered his General Motors EV1.\n\n\"It was just a car that I took home, plugged in at night, got up the next morning \u2014 it was like having a gasoline station in the garage,\" he told NPR Member station Michigan Public in 2010.\n\nTrexler was one of the hundreds of people who got to drive an EV1 \u2014 the first modern, mass-produced electric vehicle from a major automaker. The little two-door car looked like a cross between a flying saucer and a computer mouse, and it pioneered technology you can still find in today's EVs.\n\nGM built just over 1,000 EV1s before ending production in 1999, spawning a community of passionate super fans eager to join the EV revolution. But the EV1 was controversial, and short-lived. It was on the road for less than a decade. Many Americans never knew the EV1 existed \u2014 and the fight to keep it alive ended with GM crushing nearly all the cars into scrap.\n\n\"When it all happened, we just stood there and said, 'What are you guys doing?' \" filmmaker and EV advocate Chris Paine told NPR in a 2006 interview about his documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? \"The sight of seeing them destroyed before most people ever got to experience them was really quite a shocking moment for us.\"\n\nThe EV1's origins\n\nThe story of the EV1 began in 1990, when California passed sweeping regulations aimed at curbing the state's air pollution. The plan mandated automakers build zero-emission vehicles.\n\n\"It's a very radical strategy, but it's one that looks well into the next century,\" California Air Resources Board member Brian Bilbray said at the time. \"And it's really going to set the standard for air-quality strategies, not in just this state or this nation, but in the world.\"\n\nUnder pressure, automakers researched electric vehicles, hybrids and even hydrogen fuel cells to comply with the mandate. In 1992, reporter Paul Eisenstein was assigned by NPR to check out the early results, traveling to Arizona to test drive a GM prototype called the Impact.\n\n\"As you turn the key, nothing seems to be happening \u2014 until you stomp on the Impact's accelerator,\" Eisenstein reported. \"Then with a sudden lurch and an eerie whine, the Impact bursts to life, the speedometer ticking off five, 15, 30, 45 miles an hour.\"\n\nThis is the car that by 1996 hit the market as the EV1. It had zippy acceleration, aerodynamic bodywork that partially covered the rear tires, and an innovative braking system that helped recharge the battery.\n\n\"Regenerative braking works by using the motors \u2014 the drive motors \u2014 in reverse, and they act as generators,\" GM engineer Larry Oswald said. \"So when you apply the brake pedal, essentially what you're doing is generating electricity and putting it back into the battery and storing it for the next acceleration.\"\n\nThe car's battery could take you about 70 miles on a full charge. Battery technology improved over the years, increasing the EV1's range to about 100 miles. But the EV1 gave rise to a new consumer concern: \"range anxiety.\"\n\n\"The fear of being stranded; running out of power,\" Consumer Reports researcher Ron Conlin told NPR in 1997. \"The anxiety of the consumer is reflected in our studies.\"\n\nThe EV1 was only available in a few states. And it was expensive: The suggested retail price was $35,000 (more than $70,000 in today's money) but it never actually was for sale \u2014 it was only available for lease.\n\n\"The car's being marketed to an upscale consumer \u2014 very educated, very affluent, as potentially a third vehicle in the household,\" Conlin said.\n\nOnly about 800 drivers leased an EV1, according to an Associated Press article from 2005. However, reports indicated thousands more people put their name on a wait list. GM spokesperson Dave Barthmuss told NPR that the company followed up with those people, and found \"less than 50 customers\" on the wait list were willing to lease a vehicle.\n\nMany who did get the chance to lease an EV1 grew to love the way the car \u2014 with its plug-in charging and appliance-like charm \u2014 made them feel \"like we were in the 21st century,\" said documentarian Chris Paine.\n\nA little car with a big legacy\n\nGM had spent more than $1 billion on EV development. But over time, California weakened the mandate to build zero-emission vehicles. The EV1 became an unnecessary cost.\n\nThe cars' three-year lease agreements expired in the early 2000s, but GM canceled the program and took its EV1s back. In 2005, NPR reporter Luke Burbank visited a GM facility in Southern California storing dozens of repossessed EV1s. The car's supporters held vigil outside.\n\n\"We call that EV1 death row,\" said Chelsea Sexton, a former GM employee who worked on the EV1 program and was critical of the company's move to stop making electric vehicles.\n\n\"It absolutely breaks my heart,\" Sexton told NPR. \"I helped put these cars on the road in the first place, and now they're taking them away from me and from all the other drivers that had them at one point.\"\n\nChelsea Sexton hugs Paul Scott during a vigil held outside the General Motors Training Center in Burbank, Calif., protesting GM's plans to crush its EV1 electric vehicles located in the facility's parking lot. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times / Getty Images )\n\nGM loaded the EV1s onto semi trucks, hauled them to Mesa, Ariz., and crushed them. Photos showed flattened EV1s stacked on top of each other. GM said the cars were destroyed because a lack of replacement parts made the EV1 unsafe.\n\n\"There are 2,000 unique parts to this vehicle,\" Barthmuss said. \"Some of them are computer control modules that control the braking on the vehicle. If that part fails, there are some serious safety concerns.\"\n\nThe EV1 was ahead of its time\n\nTwenty-five years after EV1 production ended, every major automaker is building EVs \u2014 including GM. In October the company said it's on track to build about 200,000 EVs this year. GM set a goal to phase out gas-powered vehicles by 2035.\n\nAs for the EV1, some of the little cars escaped the crusher. In 2010, former EV1 driver Kris Trexler visited the very car he once plugged in to charge each night. It was in a new home: the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles \u2014 one of only 40 EV1s still intact, according to the museum.\n\n\"Wow, this brings back some serious memories,\" Trexler said. \"This is just amazing to see this car again.\"",

The document is composed of eight chapters detailing the following: (a) general conditions applicable to ESS for their integration into the SEN; (b) modalities of ESS for their integration into the SEN; and (c) general requirements and interconnection and/or connection procedures for parties interested in integrating their ESS into the SEN.\n\nESS Modalities\n\nThe Provisions establish the following types of ESS, each with certain legal and technical requirements described below:\n\nESS associated to a Power Plant (\"ESS-Power Plant\"); ESS associated to a Load Center (\"ESS-Load Center\"); ESS associated to an Isolated Supply scheme (\"ESS-Isolated Supply\"); ESS are not associated with a power plant or load center (\"Non-Associated ESS\"); and ESS associated to an Exempt Generator (\"ESS-Exempt Generator\").\n\nESS-Power Plant modality\n\nIn this modality the ESS-Power Plant is considered part of the power plant and must be represented by the same market participant in the Wholesale Electricity Market (Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista, \" MEM \").\n\n\"). New intermittent power plants intending to include an ESS must apply to the CRE for a generation permit. Existing intermittent power plants must request a modification to their existing power generation permit to incorporate an ESS.\n\nThe ESS-Power Plant must comply with the corresponding interconnection process.\n\nESS-Load Center modality\n\nIn this modality, the ESS-Load Center shares the same connection point with the load center and must be represented by the same market participant in the MEM.\n\nESS-Load Center does not require a power generation permit from the CRE but must be registered with the CRE within 90 business days after their installation.\n\nThe ESS-Load Center must comply with the corresponding connection process.\n\nESS-Isolated Supply modality\n\nThe ESS-Isolated Supply is integrated with a power plant and a load center operating in the isolated supply modality.\n\nNew power plants intending to include an ESS must request a generation permit from the CRE. For existing intermittent power plants, a modification of the corresponding electric power generation permit must be requested.\n\nThe ESS-Isolated Supply is regulated by the current provisions regarding isolated supply.\n\nNon-Associated ESS modality\n\nNon-Associated ESS operate independently, not integrated into a power plant or load center. They require an electric power generation permit from the CRE.\n\nNon-Associated ESS must comply with the corresponding interconnection and connection processes. Their offers to purchase and sale energy in the MEM are made like any power plant or load center.\n\nESS-Generator Exempt modality\n\nESS-Exempt Generator is regulated in accordance with the provisions on distributed generation.\n\nESS and legacy interconnection agreements\n\nPower plants and load centers included in a Legacy Interconnection Contract cannot incorporate an ESS unless they are fully excluded from it and from the corresponding permits obtained under the now-repealed Public Electricity Service Law (Ley del Servicio P\u00fablico de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica).\n\n1 Available at: https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5751230&fecha=07/03/2025",

            "content": "Market expansion, however, may be impacted by variables like shifting raw material prices, environmental laws, and competition from more recent technologies like coolers and other preservation techniques. All things considered, it is anticipated that the domestic refrigerator and freezer market will keep developing due to technological breakthroughs, environmental movements, and shifting customer tastes. Growth Drivers for the Household Refrigerators and Freezers Market\n\nOne major motivator has been the move toward contemporary, energy-efficient appliances that are intended to lower energy usage and their negative effects on the environment. In order to increase convenience and efficiency, consumers are also looking for smart refrigerators with integrated features like temperature control through smartphone apps and connectivity with home automation systems. Larger refrigeration units are also in greater demand as a result of the growing trend of food preservation and storage brought on by hectic lifestyles and the growth of online grocery shopping. To adapt to shifting consumer demands, manufacturers are implementing cutting-edge technologies, such as frost-free designs, quick-freeze alternatives, and more customizable shelving. With consumers favoring refrigerators and freezers with eco-friendly refrigerants and energy-saving features, the industry is also witnessing a shift towards more sustainable products.\n\nThe market for residential freezers and refrigerators has grown steadily as a result of growing consumer demand for dependable, technologically sophisticated, and efficient appliances. The market is expanding as consumers can now buy better refrigerators and freezers due to rising disposable incomes worldwide. Additionally, the need for tiny, space-efficient refrigeration solutions has increased due to urbanization and smaller living areas.\n\nDublin, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Household Refrigerators and Freezers Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Household Refrigerators and Freezers market is expected to reach US$ 150.78 billion by 2033 from US$ 109.86 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.58% from 2025 to 2033\n\nThe main driver of the market's encouraging growth prospects during the forecast period is consumers' growing desire for smart equipment that makes daily food storage duties easier. Additionally, the industry is being driven by factors including customers' expanding purchasing power, the number of nuclear families, the popularity of modular kitchen spaces, and shifting nutritional habits.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Eco-Friendly Preferences\n\n\n\nConsumers are placing a higher value on eco-friendly and energy-efficient home equipment, such as freezers and refrigerators, as environmental consciousness rises. Concerns about climate change, growing energy prices, and the environmental effects of conventional refrigeration technology have all contributed to a sharp increase in demand for models with reduced energy use.\n\nIn response, producers are creating freezers and refrigerators with eco-friendly refrigerants, more effective compressors, and improved insulation in an effort to lessen their carbon footprints. Additionally, as consumers look to reduce their energy use and utility expenditures, appliances bearing Energy Star ratings or comparable certifications are becoming more and more popular. In addition to being good for the environment, this move toward sustainability also reflects consumer desires to use less energy in the home and help create a more environmentally friendly future.\n\n\n\nRise in Online Shopping and E-commerce\n\n\n\nThe market for home freezers and refrigerators has been greatly impacted by the growth of online grocery shopping and home delivery services. The necessity for refrigeration systems to store perishable goods including fresh produce, dairy, and frozen foods has increased as more people buy groceries online. Customers are looking for refrigerators and freezers with more capacity and cutting-edge storage capabilities as home delivery services deliver more groceries.\n\nDemand for models with greater room, improved organization, and separate sections for various food types has increased as a result of this trend. Modern refrigeration systems that meet changing storage needs and shopping patterns are in high demand as a result of consumers' growing need for smart, energy-efficient equipment that can be managed remotely due to the ease of online shopping.\n\n\n\nImproved Affordability and Financing Options\n\n\n\nA greater spectrum of consumers may now purchase domestic refrigerators and freezers due to improved affordability and flexible financing options. Customers of all income levels can now purchase dependable, energy-efficient refrigeration systems as manufacturers release more reasonably priced versions. Additionally, retailers and appliance manufacturers are allowing customers to buy higher-quality devices without the financial burden of a lump-sum payment by providing financing plans, monthly payments, and easy credit alternatives.\n\nCustomers on a tight budget who might have been hesitant to make big purchases in the past will find this strategy appealing. The market for home refrigerators and freezers is growing as a result of consumers finding it simpler to invest in new models or upgrade their current appliances thanks to flexible financing options and reasonable prices.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Household Refrigerators and Freezers Market\n\nHigh Energy Consumption\n\n\n\nMany older home refrigerators and freezers continue to use large quantities of energy despite improvements in energy-efficient technologies, which raises users' electricity costs. These antiquated machines frequently lack contemporary energy-saving features that are present in more recent models, such as improved insulation, sophisticated compressors, and intelligent temperature controls.\n\nThey are therefore less effective, which raises operating expenses and carbon footprints. Due to the higher initial cost, some consumers may put off upgrading to newer, more energy-efficient models, making it difficult to move the market toward more sustainable solutions while existing energy-hungry items are still in use. This problem highlights the need for more advancements in energy-saving equipment as well as more customer knowledge of the long-term financial and environmental advantages.\n\n\n\nIntense Competition\n\n\n\nThe market for home freezers and refrigerators is extremely competitive, with many companies selling comparable goods, making it difficult for producers to differentiate themselves and stay profitable. In order to differentiate their products in terms of features, design, energy efficiency, and technology, businesses must continuously innovate. Customers can readily compare models because to the abundance of options, which makes them price sensitive and makes it challenging for producers to charge premium prices.\n\nAdditionally, businesses are under more pressure to provide premium goods at competitive pricing due to competition from both domestic and international brands. Manufacturers must manage production and operating costs in a crowded market while concentrating on brand loyalty, successful marketing tactics, and ongoing product advancements if they want to be profitable.\n\nCompany Analysis: Overview, Key Person, Recent Development & Strategies, Financial Insights\n\nGeneral Electric\n\nHaier Group\n\nLG Electronics\n\nRobert Bosch GmbH\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corporation\n\nSAMSUNG\n\nWhirlpool Corporation\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $109.86 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $150.78 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 3.5% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

While it has not had near the trouble that Ford (F) has had in that vein, it is still running into some issues as well. However, new reports suggest its Cadillac line will be electric in a big way, by the end of this year. Shareholders were oddly displeased, and sent shares ticking down fractionally in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nCadillac, GM\u2019s luxury brand, looks for a lot of buyers to go electric this year. In fact, it looks for between 30% and 35% of its United States sales to come from electric cars. This is a significant departure from the rest of the industry, as wide-spread sales of electric vehicles have certainly not caught on. This was absolutely not the case at Ford, where electric vehicle sales are a meager percentage of total sales.\n\nBut with the Cadillac line offering five different electric models by the end of this year, from the comparatively basic\u2014for a Cadillac\u2014Optiq to the full-on Escalade IQ, there may be a potential explanation for those sales. Cadillac buyers seem particularly interested in electric models. Moreover, GM looks to sell these models not to replace their internal combustion models, but rather to supplement them, offering a growth vector for GM as a whole.\n\nA Page out of Ford\n\nMeanwhile, GM likely also took notice when Ford offered up its home charging plans, because GM seems interested in doing something similar. GM is looking to offer up home charging capabilities as well, and focusing on Californian drivers to start with.\n\nGM is running a \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d project in California, in which GM customers get $4,500 off GM Energy \u201cbidirectional home charging equipment\u201d if they join up with a PG&E project. Basically, the project calls for electric GM vehicles to serve as supplementary power grids, supplying power back to the grid during peak hours, and recovering that power when rates are lower, during off-peak hours.\n\nIs GM a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on GM stock based on 10 Buys, three Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 18.39% rally in its share price over the past year, the average GM price target of $64.64 per share implies 32.7% upside potential.\n\nSee more GM analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "image credits: oregoncub.org\n\nOregon\u2019s energy future is being reshaped by an explosion in energy demand from data centers. These energy-hungry facilities are driving up costs across the grid, but here\u2019s the kicker: it\u2019s everyday Oregonians who would be footing the bill, if the companies don\u2019t.\n\nTo address this imbalance, the Citizens\u2019 Utility Board (CUB) and other advocacy groups are supporting House Bill 3546, also known as the Protecting Oregonians With Energy Responsibility (POWER) Act. This proposed legislation aims to ensure that large commercial energy users cover the costs directly associated with their energy consumption.\n\nThe aim of the POWER Act is to ensure that these large customers of for-profit electric utilities are paying their fair share. The bill will impact Portland General Electric, Pacific Power, and Idaho Power customers in Oregon.\n\nTo illustrate the scale of the issue:\n\nOregon Citizen\u2019s Utility Board notes that within just the last five years, data centers\u2019 growth for just Portland General Electric has been the equivalent of adding 162,400 families to PGE\u2019s system. Since 2016, PGE has seen more than a 95% growth in energy demand from industrial customers, where data centers are currently classified. Meanwhile, PGE\u2019s residential customers\u2019 energy demand has only increased 3.5% since 2016.\n\nThe rapid expansion of data centers has coincided with a sharp rise in energy bills for Oregon households. Since 2021, residential customers of Portland General Electric and Pacific Power have seen their electricity costs climb by nearly 50%. By October 2024, the two utilities had disconnected service to almost 53,000 households, the highest number reported since 2018.\n\nThis trend highlights a troubling imbalance: while energy demand from data centers has surged, these large-scale users, currently categorized under industrial rates, have not experienced comparable increases in their energy costs. In other words, ordinary customers are absorbing the financial impact, while the largest energy consumers continue to benefit from outdated rate structures.\n\nimage credits: oregoncub.org\n\nWhat the POWER Act Does\n\nHB 3546 creates new rules for regulators and large energy-using customers that meet a set of criteria. For a customer to qualify for this new customer category, they must be a business using 20 megawatts or more and meet certain tech industry classifications*. Data centers and cryptocurrency businesses are the primary businesses impacted.\n\nOregon Public Utility Commission: Protecting Households and Small Businesses\n\nCreate a new customer category for data centers and cryptocurrency shops starting at 20MW customers\n\nProtect families and small businesses from costs when bringing these new large energy users onto the grid\n\nPrevent risk for families and small businesses from paying for the costs of these large energy users\n\nSelected Large Energy Users: Ensuring Energy Investments Are Used & Paid For\n\nSign contracts for at least 10 years to ensure expensive investments are worth it\n\nPay for the investments that were made to connect them to the grid, even if they use less energy than expected\n\nPay an extra fee if they use too much, ensuring excess costs don\u2019t go to households",

            "content": "GE Aerospace (GE, Financial) saw its stock rise by 2.5%, reaching a price of $202.03. This increase follows the company's announcement of a notable contract with the U.S. Air Force, which is valued at up to $5 billion for supplying F110-GE-129 engines. These engines are integral to F-15 and F-16 aircraft used by the U.S. and its allies globally.\n\nGE Aerospace, a leader in aerospace and defense and a core component of the broader General Electric, boasts an impressive market cap of $215.48 billion. The company's F110 engine, with over 11 million flight hours, underscores its longstanding reliability and performance. This aligns well with recent company comments emphasizing the F110 as a preferred choice for military fleets.\n\nDespite the stock's upward movement, certain valuation metrics suggest caution. GE Aerospace's current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stands at 33.73, and its price-to-book (PB) ratio is close to a 10-year high at 11.22. Furthermore, the GF Value indicates that GE is \"Significantly Overvalued,\" with a GF Value estimate of $130.92. You can explore this further on the GF Value page.\n\nIn terms of financial health, GE Aerospace's financial strength and profitability scores reveal a mixed picture. The Altman Z-score of 2.76 suggests some financial stress, albeit not critical. On the positive side, its operating margin is expanding, and the dividend yield is near a 2-year high, highlighting potential for income-focused investors.\n\nLooking at growth metrics, GE Aerospace's revenue growth has faced challenges, with a decline in revenue per share over the past five years. Nonetheless, the company's recent 44% EBIT growth and significant earnings boost signal potential operational improvements.\n\nOverall, GE Aerospace (GE, Financial) remains a prominent player in the aerospace and defense sector. However, investors should weigh the company's strong operational features against its current overvaluation and financial warning signs.",

LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nPower loss affecting millions in Cuba\n\nHAVANA -- Millions of people in Cuba remained without power Saturday after a failure of the nation's electric grid left the island in the dark the previous night.\n\nThe blackout is the fourth in the last six months as a severe economic crisis plagues the Caribbean country. The Ministry of Energy and Mines, in a statement on social media, attributed the latest outage to a failure at a substation in the suburbs of Havana, the capital.\n\nInternet and telephone service were intermittent about 18 hours after power went out around 8 p.m. local time Friday.\n\nL\u00e1zaro Guerra, director of electricity at the ministry, said on national television that power was already being generated to support vital services such as hospitals.\n\nA statement from the Cuban Electricity Union released Saturday said the strategy was to create \"microsystems\" that will connect to each other to gradually restore electricity across the country. Several of these were already operating in the provinces of Guant\u00e1namo, Santiago, Las Tunas and Pinar del R\u00edo.\n\nIn Sancti Sp\u00edritus, the provincial energy company reported on its Telegram channel that more than 200,000 customers in that area had electricity thanks to these microsystems.\n\nPakistani forces raid militant hideouts\n\nPESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Pakistan's security forces raided two militant hideouts in the country's restive northwest on Saturday, triggering gunbattles that left at least two soldiers and nine militants dead, the military said in a statement.\n\nThe raids were conducted in the Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to local police officials, the insurgents were Pakistani Taliban, who are known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.\n\nThe outlawed TTP is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban.\n\nIn a separate incident on Saturday, insurgents ambushed security forces in the northwestern Kurram district of Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan, local police said. However, authorities have yet to confirm any troop casualties.\n\nPakistan's military is currently engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslim communities.\n\nAlso on Saturday, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing cleric Mufti Shakir, local police said. It was unclear who was behind the attack and an investigation is continuing.\n\nDeadly airstrike hits Myanmar village\n\nBANGKOK -- An airstrike by Myanmar's military on a central village under the control of resistance forces has killed at least 27 civilians and injured 30 others, an opposition group and Myanmar's online media said Saturday.\n\nThe attack occurred Friday at 3 p.m. in Let Pan Hla village in Singu township, about 40 miles north of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, a spokesperson for the Mandalay People's Defense Force said.\n\nThe military did not comment on Saturday.\n\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition.\n\nThe town of Singu was seized by the Mandalay People's Defence Force, which supports Myanmar's main opposition, in July last year.\n\nThe group's statement released Saturday on its Telegram social media channel said six children were among the 27 killed in the airstrike that targeted crowded market stalls in Let Pan Hla village.\n\nOsmond, the group's spokesperson, told The Associated Press that about 10 houses near the village market were destroyed by bombs.\n\nThe situation in the village could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe independent Myanmar Now online media reported that the death toll from the airstrike had reached 30 and seven were in critical condition.\n\nRussian remanded in fatal sea collision\n\nLONDON -- The Russian captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker last week appeared in a U.K. court Saturday where he was remanded in custody over the death of a crew member, who is missing and presumed dead.\n\nVladimir Motin, the master of the Portugal-flagged cargo vessel Solong, appeared in Hull Magistrates' Court after being charged with \"gross negligence manslaughter.\"\n\nNo pleas were entered and Motin will appear next at the Central Criminal Court, better known as the Old Bailey, on April 14.\n\nMotin, 59, is from Primorsky, St. Petersburg. He was arrested in northeast England on Tuesday, a day after the collision with the MV Stena Immaculate, a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has named the crew member presumed to have died in the collision as 38-year-old Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia.\n\nShipping company Ernst Russ, which owns the Solong, has said previously that the ship's 14-person crew was a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.\n\nU.K. authorities have said there is nothing so far to indicate that it's connected to national security.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents wait outside on a street during a general blackout in Havana, Cuba, Friday, March 14, 2025.

But, Davis is just getting started as the new GM.\n\nDavis is now in charge of keeping the lights on and the water flowing in the First Town in the First State.\n\n\u201cAustin [Calaman] and I had been working together for three years, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big shift. The plans are in place and ratepayers should be comfortable with how we\u2019re moving forward,\u201d Davis said.\n\nCalaman, the previous general manager, left in late December. Calaman\u2019s name was the last on that whiteboard.\n\nThe BPW board of directors unanimously voted to hire Davis Feb. 26 at a salary of $150,000 per year.\n\nTom Panetta, board president, called Davis the best qualified candidate out of the five finalists they interviewed.\n\nDavis will now oversee a staff of 20 employees who work on the BPW\u2019s three utilities: water, sewer and electric. They also manage stormwater.\n\nHe had been assistant GM since 2022 and served as interim GM since Calaman\u2019s departure. So, Davis is already familiar with BPW\u2019s big projects and challenges, the biggest being the future of the city\u2019s wastewater treatment plant.\n\nBPW was counting on being part of three-way partnership with Rehoboth Beach and Sussex County to solve its need for a new facility. But, the City of Rehoboth Beach voted against the agreement Feb. 21. It would have allowed the county to connect its Wolfe Neck Regional Wastewater Facility to the city\u2019s ocean outfall and pump up to 5 million gallons per day through the outfall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on other options, probably to see if we can partner with the county again. But that still needs to be worked on,\u201d he said.\n\nBPW will hold a public workshop on the wastewater treatment plant options Tuesday, March 18 at the Rollins Center.\n\nDavis inherits a host of ongoing projects large and small, including the construction of a new water tower and the new water main canal crossing, which he said should be in service in a matter of weeks.\n\nHe said replacing aging infrastructure is a top priority.\n\n\u201cOur staff has done a fabulous job keeping up with all of our infrastructure, keeping up with preventative maintenance. So, the reliability is always there,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis was born and raised in Milton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here all my life, and I\u2019ve seen a mess of growth, from open fields to a lot of building going on,\u201d he said.\n\nDavis served more than seven years in the U.S. Air Force. When he got out of the service, Davis went to work for a plumbing company.\n\nAfter four years of night school and a two-year apprenticeship program, Davis got his master plumbers license and started his own business.\n\nHe shifted gears and became Milton\u2019s water department supervisor in 2003, before moving into the town\u2019s building department. He worked for the City of Lewes building department for seven years. He moved to the BPW side in 2021.\n\nDavis said he has begun the search to fill the vacant assistant general manager position.\n\n\u201cI think residents are in good hands. I\u2019m looking forward to keeping the ship moving,\u201d Davis said.",

The upcoming iX3 was also previewed with a concept, the Vision Neue Klasse X, in early 2024.\n\nBMW previously sold an iX3 based on the previous-generation X3, though that electric crossover was built in China and never offered in the U.S. Similarly, the automaker also offers an electric version of the current 3-Series, badged as an i3, exclusively in the Chinese market.\n\nBMW Vision Neue Klasse X concept\n\nThe new iX3, which will form part of the current X3 compact crossover family, is already in pre-production at a newly constructed plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first customer vehicles will start rolling off the line at the Debrecen plant in late 2025, which suggests the vehicle may reach U.S. showrooms as a 2026 model, though a delay until the 2027 model year is also possible.\n\nNeue Klasse EVs will ride on a next-generation EV platform that promises improved power and efficiency, plus faster charging thanks to an 800-volt electrical system. Neue Klasse EVs will also benefit from a next-generation battery with cylindrical cells (instead of the current prismatic cell design BMW uses), and together with other improvements, should result in a range improvement of 30% over BMW's current EVs, the automaker has previously said.\n\nThe Neue Klasse EV platform also includes an overhaul of BMW's electrical systems and chassis control technologies. For the electrical systems, zonal design, where fewer control units are used for more functions, has been implemented. According to BMW, this has enabled designers to use almost 2,000 feet of less wiring, helping to save weight while increasing energy efficiency. This extends to the drivetrain and chassis management system that consolidates multiple control units into a single, advanced unit BMW refers to as the Heart of Joy.\n\nThe Neue Klasse EVs will also usher in a new interface that replaces the traditional gauge cluster with a head-up display spanning the base of the windshield. Additionally, a central touchscreen will handle infotainment and various vehicle functions. This interface will also be spread to BMW's gas and plug-in hybrid lineup.",

            "content": "In new research, Carl T. Bogus uses General Electric as a case study to argue that regulators should prohibit companies that have reached a certain size from growing through mergers and acquisitions due to more common inefficiencies and their outsized harms to stakeholders and society.\n\nOnce a corporation reaches a certain size, it should be prohibited from growing larger through mergers or acquisitions due to increasing likelihoods of diseconomies of scale, risks to innovation, and the disproportionate harm from irrational behavior. Where to place a merger cap is a matter of judgment, not science, but it might apply to companies with revenues exceeding 0.5% of the gross national product. Currently, that would include about 325 firms in the United States.\n\nThis is a radical proposal. It flies in the face of current antitrust doctrine, which holds that firm size is irrelevant and that mergers should be permitted unless the new firm will have sufficient market power to raise prices. That depends on the market share of the new firm and the number of rivals with which it will compete.\n\nModern merger policy assumes that companies know what they are doing. If a merger is competitively permissible because it will not give the new firm sufficient market power to raise prices, and the merging parties want to pursue the merger nonetheless, then the parties must have determined that the merger will create efficiencies that will make the new firm more profitable and create wealth for shareholders and customers through lower costs. But studies show this assumption is wrong. Most mergers do not create efficiencies. But if companies do, in fact, know what they are doing, how can that be?\n\nAn evaluation of the merger history of General Electric Company from 1981 to 2017 helps answer that question. It also illustrates why a merger cap makes sense. During those years, GE\u2019s CEOs were Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt. GE was considered the best managed company in America; some believed it had transformed management into \u201csomething resembling a hard science.\u201d If there was a company capable of making smart acquisitions, it should have been GE.\n\nDuring those 36 years, GE acquired nearly 1,380 other companies. Almost all of those acquisitions failed; that is, they did not make GE more efficient, more innovative, or more profitable. In fact, GE\u2019s acquisitions all but destroyed what had been one of the nation\u2019s most revered companies.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three of GE\u2019s most important acquisitions to see what we can learn.\n\nIn December 1985, GE agreed to purchase RCA Corporation for $6.28 billion. On paper, the merger seemed sensible: GE made land-based radar; RCA made ship-based radar. GE made military satellites; RCA made civilian satellites. Both companies made semiconductors and televisions. But the merger was not about any of that. GE acquired RCA for only one reason: RCA owned the NBC television network. GE sold its semiconductor business in 1988 and all defense-related businesses in 1992. By 1998, GE had shed all remaining vestiges of RCA except for NBC.\n\nIf a television network seems like an odd acquisition for an industrial corporation, it is because it was an odd acquisition. Jack Welch simply wanted to own a television network. He became interested in RCA only after both CBS and ABC had become unavailable. The consensus today is that NBC was a vanity purchase. Welch relished appearing as a guest on CNBC\u2019s Business Center and NBC\u2019s Tonight Show, playing golf with NBC celebrities and having them at home for dinner parties, and personally participating in contract renegotiations with stars like Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nWhen GE acquired it, NBC was riding high. But GE knew nothing about running a television network, and it put its own managers at the head of the network. By 1992, NBC was in last place and hemorrhaging tens of millions of dollars per year.\n\nLesson 1: Corporate acquisitions can have more to do with the personal motivations and foibles of corporate leaders than with sound business strategy. While this can happen to a company of any size, the potential magnitude of socially harmful behavior is greater with giant firms that can afford more and larger acquisitions.\n\n*\n\nIn 1986, GE acquired the securities trading and investment banking firm Kidder Peabody. Welch wanted to bring in house the investment-banking work for GE\u2019s enormous volume of mergers. As Welch explained, \u201cWe were getting tired of putting up all of the money and taking all of the risk while watching the investment bankers walk away with huge up-front fees.\u201d GE settled on Kidder Peabody only after more prominent investment banks rebuffed its advances. Kidder needed the merger because it was undercapitalized.\n\nGE knew no more about securities than it knew about television. Kidder\u2019s CEO, Ralph DeNunzio, outmaneuvered GE into ultimately paying $1.15 billion for a firm that earned $43 million in the year preceding the acquisition. Following an insider-trading scandal, Welch replaced DeNunzio with a series of GE managers unschooled in securities. The last executive in the series rewarded a Kidder trader who had racked up a truly unbelievable number of trades by naming him Kidder\u2019s \u201cMan of the Year\u201d and giving him a $9 million bonus\u2014only to discover that a vast number of the trades were fraudulent and $350 million was missing. In 1994, GE threw in the towel and sold Kidder. Welch later said, \u201cIt was a classic case of hubris\u2026.I thought I could make anything work.\u201d\n\nLesson 2: The larger the firm, the greater its complexity and the more top management will not understand the operations of various divisions and subsidies.\n\n*\n\nWhen he retired in 2001, Welch was widely acclaimed as the greatest CEO of his time. Under his watch, GE stock rose from $1.20 to about $50 per share. Fortune pronounced Welch \u201cManager of the Century.\u201d But Welch\u2019s handpicked successor, Jeff Immelt, knew better. The once great industrial giant had become a hodgepodge of unrelated businesses. GE acquisitions\u2014 averaging four per month, sustained over twenty years\u2014had mesmerized Wall Street. Yet nearly all of Welch\u2019s nearly 1,000 mergers failed to provide their predicted benefits. GE\u2019s acquisition assembly line had been something of a Ponzi scheme, with new mergers financed by breaking up and selling off parts of prior mergers. There was a disjunction between short-term profitability (and activity that, with the help of creative accounting, appeared profitable) and long-term company health and profitability.\n\nLesson 3: Perhaps the market cannot be fooled forever, but it can be fooled for a very long time. The complexity of larger firms can better hide irrational and unprofitable behavior from shareholders and regulators.\n\n*\n\nImmelt needed to pull GE out of a tailspin without revealing it was in one. He decided to return GE to its industrial roots through a new acquisition strategy of divesting GE of some of its non-industrial businesses while acquiring new industrial holdings. The most important of Immelt\u2019s 380 acquisitions\u2014and the largest in GE history\u2014was buying the power generation and transmission businesses of the French firm Alstom S.A.\n\nGE and Alstom agreed on a $13.5 billion purchase price. But the French government\u2014unhappy with losing the largest part of a national champion\u2014tried to block the acquisition. EU and U.S. antitrust regulators also objected to the deal as originally structured. To win approval, GE repeatedly sweetened its offer. The purchase price rose to $13.8 billion while GE wound up buying considerably less. When the GE business development team crunched the final numbers, they concluded the acquisition no longer made sense. And it wasn\u2019t even close. The team expected the GE officer to whom they reported to recommend that Immelt invoke a breakup clause and terminate the deal. Instead, that officer told them, \u201cThis is Jeff\u2019s deal. We are not backing away.\u201d\n\nThe merger was consummated but turned out to be a flop. Immelt later conceded he overpaid by $2 or $3 billion. Why had that happened? Organizational behaviorists have identified an \u201cescalation of commitment\u201d bias, which causes some administrators who become committed to course to escalate the commitment of resources toward that objective, even when confronted with evidence that they should back off.\n\nLesson 4: Business decisions can be irrational, even important ones by sophisticated companies. With larger companies, irrational decisions have more severe consequences.\n\n*\n\nResearch and development are expensive; researchers will reach many dead ends before exclaiming \u201cEurika!\u201d It is more efficient for a corporate giant to divest in R&D and simply acquire other firms that make valuable discoveries. That is what GE did. In a 2009 speech, Immelt confessed, \u201cWhile some of America\u2019s competitors were throttling up on manufacturing and R&D, we deemphasized technology.\u201d\n\nGrowing organically is hard work. Here, too, being big enough to buy others has advantages. In 1994, the Wall Street Journal reported: \u201cAnother way GE manages its earnings is by literally buying them\u2014by acquiring companies or assets that are immediately profitable because they throw off more income than GE\u2019s cost of financing.\u201d\n\nLesson 5: It is too easy for giant companies to buy rather than earn success. This makes giant firms less creative and suppresses society-wide innovation.\n\n*\n\nBack when Welch became CEO, GE employed 400,000 people. When he stepped down in 2001, it employed 300,000. GE\u2019s workforce shrank by 25% even though it had absorbed nearly 1,000 other companies. In the main, GE\u2019s acquisition program was not about making the firms it purchased, or itself, more efficient. GE behaved like a hedge fund: shuttering, offshoring, and selling off large portions of its acquisitions.\n\nWall Street loved GE for the same reasons it loves hedge funds. Other giant companies imitated GE, often hiring Welch acolytes as their CEOs. Countless people were thrown out of work while corporate cultures shifted from earning success to dazzling Wall Street.\n\nBoeing was one such company. No longer content with making reasonable profits while building the world\u2019s best airplanes, Boeing merged with aerospace manufacturer McDonnell-Douglas, whose CEO, Harry Stonecipher\u2014a former Welch prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2014became CEO of the merged firm. Boeing\u2019s board wanted Stonecipher to replicate at Boeing the soaring stock prices he had achieved at McDonnell. Stonecipher, like Welch, was all about prioritizing short-term shareholder value above all else. At McDonnell, he had spent precious funds to boost the company\u2019s stock price through stock buyback programs while cutting R&D 60 percent. When a scandal forced Stonecipher to resign from Boeing, the board replaced him with another Welch disciple to continue the work making shareholder value, rather than quality, the company\u2019s highest value.\n\nLesson 6: Firm merger strategy affects more than merging firms and their shareholders. The financial resources and complexity of giant companies make them better able to acquire more firms and more prone to decisions that negatively affect workers and customers.\n\n*\n\nIn 2000, GE\u2019s stock price hit a high of $300 per share. But its aggressive acquisition strategy, which led it to buy and attempt to operate many businesses it did not understand while disinvesting in R&D, coupled with otherwise prioritizing short-term shareholder value over long-term company health, finally caught up with it. Investors realized something was wrong when Immelt twice failed to meet his own publicly announced earnings projections. Immelt was forced to resign in 2017, and a series of successors could not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, either. Simply too much damage had been done. GE\u2019s storied history ended in 2021 when the 129-year-old firm split into three separate companies. It would be a mistake to think of GE as outlier. While few, if any, companies may have made as many acquisitions in the same period of time, many of today\u2019s giants have grown to their present size through scores\u2014even hundreds\u2014of mergers. GE confirms what studies have shown: most mergers fail. The GE story illustrates some of the reasons mergers fail, how long failures can be concealed, and that damage resulting from mergers by corporate giants affects not only the merging firms and their shareholders but workers and society-at-large. Finally, GE shows why the benefits of a merger cap are likely to exceed its costs.\n\nAuthor\u2019s Disclosures: The authors report no conflicts of interest.

            "content": "Dublin, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Combined Heat and Power Market Report 2025\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe combined heat and power market size has grown strongly in recent years. It grew from $29.17 billion in 2024 to $31.01 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to energy efficiency goals, industrial cogeneration, environmental regulations, increased combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) applications, district heating and cooling projects, waste heat recovery, decentralization of energy generation, increased awareness of CHP benefits.\n\nThis report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market. It traces the market's historic and forecast market growth by geography. Asia-Pacific was the largest region in the combined heat and power market in 2024. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the global combined heat and power (CHP) market share during the forecast period.\n\nKey Companies Profiled: General Electric Company; Siemens AG; Veolia Environnement S.A.; Wartsila Oyj Abp; 2G Energy AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined heat and power market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $41.61 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.6%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to transition to low-carbon energy systems, smart grid integration, resilience planning in critical infrastructure, urbanization and district energy networks, biogas and biomass CHP projects, support for micro-CHP in residential settings. Major trends in the forecast period include energy-as-a-service (EaaS) models, market consolidation and partnerships, remote monitoring and control, technological advancements, grid resilience and reliability, collaboration between utilities and CHP providers, advancements in fuel cell CHP systems.\n\n\n\nThe increasing adoption of biomass power is driving the growth of the combined heat and power (CHP) market. For example, in April 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a U.S. agency that collects and disseminates energy data, projected that renewables would account for 24% of electricity generation in the U.S., increasing to 25% by 2025. Within this renewable energy sector, biomass is expected to contribute approximately 2.27% to renewable electricity generation in 2024. Thus, the growing adoption of biomass power is anticipated to significantly boost the growth of the combined heat and power market in the coming years.\n\n\n\nThe rising emphasis on energy efficiency is anticipated to drive the growth of the combined heat and power (CHP) market in the future. For instance, in June 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization, highlighted that global improvements in energy efficiency must double by 2030 to meet climate objectives. The IEA emphasizes the need for an annual progress rate exceeding 4% to stay within the 1.5C global warming threshold. Additionally, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is accelerating rapidly, with global EV sales reaching 2.3 million units in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 25% increase compared to the same period in 2022. This growth underscores the rising trend towards energy-efficient, digitally-enabled technologies that are essential for facilitating sustainable energy transitions. Therefore, the increase in energy efficiency is propelling the growth of the combined heat and power market.\n\n\n\nInnovative technological solutions, exemplified by the Bloom Energy Server, are playing a crucial role in the profitability and advancement of major companies in the combined heat and power market. Bloom Energy, a US-based green energy company, launched the Bloom Energy Server in February 2023. This cutting-edge fuel cell power generation system is designed to efficiently generate electricity to meet diverse energy demands while maintaining a compact modular footprint. The Bloom Energy Server is recognized for delivering clean, reliable, and cost-effective energy solutions on-site, offering dependable and consistent power.

            "content": "A hearings officer for the city of Portland has approved Portland General Electric\u2019s plan to upgrade transmission lines at the northern end of Forest Park, a project that will require cutting down 376 trees and filling two wetlands in an area that\u2019s home to the northern red-legged frog, an at-risk species.\n\nTo reach her decision, Marisha Childs dismissed a long list of environmental concerns from staff at Portland\u2019s Permitting & Development Office, which in January had strongly recommended rejecting the project. Childs found instead in her 33-page decision that PGE\u2019s \u201chabitat mitigation plan extensively, credibly, and persuasively provides for how the project proposal will protect Forest Park\u2019s native plant and animal communities, its soil and water resources, and allows for the ecosystem to grow into an ancient forest.\u201d\n\nPGE, which welcomed the decision, said it will plant about 400 trees in the project area, and another 400 elsewhere in Forest Park. It will also plant trees in overheated Portland neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThe decision to approve PGE\u2019s permit request is an example of the process working as it should, and will allow PGE to proceed with work that is crucial for safe, reliable and increasingly clean energy for Portland homes and businesses,\u201d vice president of policy and resource planning Kristen Sheeran said in a statement.\n\nScott Fogarty, executive director of the Forest Park Conservancy, which has opposed the project throughout the approval process, says his group is likely to appeal the decision to the Portland City Council.\n\n\u201cThis is a great step backwards in our city\u2019s efforts to promote climate resilience, community engagement, and proper use of our critical greenspaces,\u201d Fogarty says. \u201cWe plan on working with other organizations and local community partners to continue to push back on PGE\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story mentioned only trees that PGE planned to plant in Portland neighborhoods. It plans to plant about 800 within Forest Park, too.",

            "content": "Oregon lawmakers are considering a legislative package that would provide some protection to utility companies whose equipment sparks wildfires.\n\nHouse Bill 3917, introduced Tuesday by Rep. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland, would create a fund to help people who lose homes or businesses to utility-caused wildfires \u2014 as long as they agree not to sue utility companies for that damage.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nMarsh is also sponsoring a complementary bill, House Bill 3666, which would allow the Oregon Public Utility Commission to grant a safety certificate to utilities it deems are \u201cacting reasonably with regard to wildfire safety practices.\u201d\n\nRelated: Residents of Gates, Oregon, aim their ire at Pacific Power nearly a year after their town burned\n\nThe wildfire assistance fund created by HB 3917 would be seeded by utility companies that are regulated by the state\u2019s Public Utility Commission, including Pacific Power and Portland General Electric. Half of their their seed contribution could come from ratepayer dollars, and the other half would come from the share of rates designated for profits.\n\nUtilities would contribute more to the fund if their equipment sparked a wildfire. They\u2019d be allowed to increase customer rates to cover these costs. If an investigator determined the company acted negligently, then that money could not come from customers\u2019 rates.\n\nAn independent administrator could also ask the Legislature to contribute additional money through the state\u2019s all-purpose General Fund.\n\nFILE - Evidence suggests this fire at Gates School is one of several sparked by power lines on Sept. 7, 2020. A firefighter called 9-1-1 to report the fire that started when high winds blew trees into power lines. Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service / Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service\n\nNo public comments had been submitted in response to HB 3917 in the hours right after the wildfire assistance fund was proposed on Tuesday, but many attorneys who have represented wildfire victims in cases against utility companies have taken issue with portions of its companion bill.\n\nThey say HB 3666 gives trillion-dollar private companies like Berkshire Hathaway, which owns PacifiCorp, immunity against lawsuits, because these companies could argue that they did what they reasonably could to prevent their equipment from starting a fire if they get a safety certificate from the Oregon Public Utility Commission.\n\n\u201c[Berkshire Hathaway] wants Oregonians to give it a \u2018get-out-of-jail-free\u2019 card, no matter how badly it acts\u201d said Cody Berne, an attorney who has represented Oregon wildfire survivors in a class-action lawsuit against PacifiCorp.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has supported similar legislation in other states where it owns utility companies, including in California, Wyoming and Idaho. Oregon\u2019s HB 3666 is the only bill that would offer utilities a certificate demonstrating they are \u201cacting reasonably\u201d by creating and implementing a wildfire safety plan.\n\nRelated: For victims still recovering from Oregon\u2019s 2020 Labor Day wildfires, millions in legal damages offer hope\n\nIn California, for instance, a wildfire safety certificate is only used to determine whether utility can pass on costs to ratepayers and whether they can access a wildfire relief fund.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nMarsh, whose district lost upwards of 2,500 homes to the 2020 Labor Day weekend fires, doesn\u2019t see HB 3666 as an immunity bill. Rather, it ensures utilities are following their own wildfire mitigation plans.\n\n\u201cI asked legislative counsel, which drafted the bill, for very specific answers to a couple of questions, like, \u2018Does this bill give immunity to utilities that hold a safety certification?\u2019\u201d Marsh said. \u201cAnd the answer was, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Marsh recognizes these bills provide utility companies a level of financial protection. Marsh\u2019s district is mostly served by Pacific Power, a subsidiary of PacifiCorp.\n\n\u201cWe know that utilities are operating in a time of tremendous risk, and we really don\u2019t want our utilities to go bankrupt,\u201d Marsh said.\n\nInvestor owned utility companies, like PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric, support this two-bill legislative package.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires from starting in the first place by increasing the standards, clarifying the standards, and holding utilities more accountable to those standards in the hopes of mitigating additional wildfire risk,\u201d Kristen Sheeran, PGE vice president for policy and resource planning, said.\n\nIn financial filings, PacifiCorp executives have estimated that the 2020 and 2022 wildfires cost the company nearly $2.7 billion. Berkshire Hathaway has estimated that its utilities face at least $8 billion in claims across all wildfire lawsuits filed in Oregon and California.\n\nRelated: Jury awards $50M to 2020 Oregon wildfire survivors, adding to PacifiCorp\u2019s growing tab\n\nIn California, utility customers largely footed those costs through ratepayer increases. Between 2019 and 2023, California\u2019s public utility commission allowed the state\u2019s three largest utilities to collect $27 billion in wildfire prevention and insurance costs from ratepayers, according to a legislative report .\n\nSome nonprofit cooperatives that provide electricity to rural areas support Marsh\u2019s wildfire certification bill, HB 3666. These organizations formed in Oregon in the 1920s and \u201830s to serve mountainous, sparsely populated areas that investor-owned utilities weren\u2019t interested in.\n\nKeith Brooks, general manager at the Douglas Electric Cooperative serving the Douglas County area, said a lawsuit similar to the ones PacifiCorp has faced would drive his organization into the ground.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll just have to tell us who to turn the keys over to the cooperative, which is really scary for us, because this is a community-owned power company,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to want the keys.\u201d\n\nBrooks said the Douglas Electric Cooperative has tripled its spending on vegetation management over the last few years to ensure trees don\u2019t fall on power lines. The co-op also buries all new power lines. Still, these actions alone won\u2019t protect the nonprofit if its equipment sparks a fire. The likelihood of that increases each year, as climate change makes weather in this Southern Oregon community hotter and drier.\n\nBrooks wants the state utility commission to tell him if his wildfire mitigation plan is enough, and what to do if it isn\u2019t, because wildfire prevention work isn\u2019t cheap.\n\n\u201cI hear every day people talk about choices that they\u2019re making between food or medicine, and electricity. Their bill is already going up because of wildfire mitigation,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI need every dollar to count.\u201d",

            "content": "One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Portland General Electric Company ( ).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Portland General Electric is:\n\n8.2% = US$313m \u00f7 US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.\n\nDoes Portland General Electric Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Portland General Electric has a similar ROE to the average in the classification (9.1%).\n\nSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Portland General Electric by visiting our risks dashboard for free\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nCombining Portland General Electric's Debt And Its 8.2% Return On Equity\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Portland General Electric, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.20. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nSummary\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free .\n\nOf course Portland General Electric may not be the best stock to buy.

It provides important habitat for vulnerable species, particularly Northern red-legged frogs \u2014 as well as more than 80 miles of trails for Portlanders seeking easy nearby access to the wilderness.\n\nPGE\u2019s proposal has drawn fierce opposition from environmental groups and many residents, as well as the city of Portland itself. Earlier this year , the Portland Permitting & Development office recommended a hearings officer deny the project.\n\nAt that time, Portland permitting staff said PGE failed to fully assess alternatives to cutting through Forest Park. They also highlighted PGE\u2019s plans to pursue additional grid projects that could impact another 15 acres within the park.\n\nAn undated photo of Forest Park in Portland, Ore. A Portland hearings officer has approved a utility company\u2019s plans to cut through almost 5 acres of Forest Park. Vince Patton / OPB\n\nPGE says this project is needed to meet future energy demands , particularly as the company moves away from fossil fuels and prepares the grid to carry more renewably generated power. After the poles and transmission lines are installed, PGE says it will plant Oregon white oaks and other native shrubs, and it will leave some cut trees behind as habitat for insects and animals.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nIn her decision issued Friday, Portland hearings officer Marisha Childs called this case a \u201clegal quagmire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is both true that as a society our energy needs have increased and it is also true that Forest Park is a highly valued environmental resource,\u201d Childs wrote. \u201cThis land use case however, is about facts, not feelings.\u201d\n\nChilds found the city\u2019s analysis \u201cconfounding and inconsistent\u201d with local environmental and land use rules. PGE demonstrated that energy demands make this project necessary, Childs argued, and cutting into Forest Park is \u201cthe best practicable\u201d and \u201cleast environmentally detrimental\u201d option.\n\nChilds' decision means PGE can move forward with its transmission project in Forest Park.\n\nIn a statement, Kristen Sheeren, PGE vice president of policy and resource planning, celebrated the decision, calling it \u201cthe most significant finding of facts about this project coming out of an extraordinarily detailed application process that included extensive public involvement.\u201d\n\nSome environmental groups disagreed with Childs' assessment.\n\n\u201cWe do not think this project should move forward through Forest Park because you cannot mitigate the destruction of an ecosystem that has been growing since before we even had electricity in homes,\u201d Damon Motz-Storey, Sierra Club Oregon Chapter director, said in a statement.\n\nMotz-Storey did not say if the Sierra Club would appeal the hearings officer\u2019s decision. Appeals cost upwards of $5,700, though they may be free for some neighborhood associations.\n\nAs outlined in Childs' decision, PGE will need to monitor its white oak and native shrub plantings for two years. It will need to submit maintenance reports to the city that include a count of the number of plants that have died and photographs of the restoration area. PGE is then responsible for the ongoing survival of the trees and plants after this two-year period.",

            "content": "Entering 2025, the EV industry anticipates a year of transition, marked by both challenges and opportunities. A risk lies in potential policy shifts, particularly in the US, where a change in administration could jeopardize existing EV incentives and regulations. The potential repeal of the federal tax credit, for instance, could impact EV affordability and demand. Furthermore, trade tensions, especially between China and Western nations, pose hurdles to market access. Increased tariffs and import restrictions could disrupt supply chains and limit consumer choice. However, there's optimism for improved macroeconomic conditions. As inflationary pressures subside and central banks begin to lower interest rates, EV affordability is expected to improve. Moreover, the long-term trajectory towards electrification, driven by emission regulations and industry investments, appears irreversible.\n\nThe EV sector navigated a turbulent 2024 due to macroeconomic pressures. Tradu recently reported that elevated inflation and surging interest rates globally constricted consumer spending, particularly on high-value items like EVs. This economic strain translated into a noticeable deceleration in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales across key markets, notably Europe and the US. In Europe, BEV registrations experienced a decline, while hybrid vehicle sales surged. This reflected a consumer shift towards more affordable and range-extended options. The US market, while still growing, witnessed a slowdown compared to the previous year's expansion. China, however, grew, with new energy vehicle (NEV) sales, which included BEVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles, and surpassed 50% of total sales. This regional disparity underscored the varied pace of EV adoption worldwide.\n\nIn 2024, the worldwide EV (electric vehicle) market value was roughly $1.32 trillion, as reported by Grand View Research, and it is expected to expand at a CAGR 32.5% between 2025 and 2030. Worldwide governmental rules and rewards are boosting EV sales. Numerous nations enact strict pollution laws and give rebates, tax cuts, and other benefits to buyers and producers, which pushes a change from gas-powered cars to electric ones. Furthermore, battery tech gains are improving EV range, power, and cost. New ideas like solid-state cells and better lithium-ion cells cut costs and boost energy storage, thus making EVs more attractive.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Undervalued EV Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against the other undervalued EV stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA pivotal factor influencing EV adoption in 2025 will be the introduction of more affordable models. Recognizing the need to expand their customer base, major automakers are developing sub-$30,000 EVs. Chinese manufacturers, using their cost advantages and established supply chains, will play a role in this segment and offer competitive pricing and a wider range of models. The availability of affordable EVs is expected to be a major catalyst for market growth. Additionally, the advancements in autonomous driving technology are anticipated to revive the EV sector. While regulatory hurdles and safety concerns remain, 2025 could witness accelerated deployment of autonomous driving features. This will enhance the overall user experience and expand the potential applications of EVs. The convergence of electrification and autonomy will reshape the automotive landscape and drive innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through online rankings and stock screeners to compile a list of the top EV stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 20. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nGeneral Motors Company (GM): Among Companies that Just Raised their Dividends\n\nA group of technicians in a garage, inspecting car parts and ensuring safety compliance.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 7: 4.11\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a global automotive manufacturer that is actively transitioning to EVs.

In China, the company's EV and plug-in hybrid sales have surpassed ICE models. It has reduced dealer inventory by over 50% to improve pricing and cost management.\n\nHotchkis & Wiley Large Cap Value Fund sees General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) as an attractive and undervalued investment due to its strong market position, free cash flow, and management's commitment to share repurchases. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of passenger vehicles. GM reported a strong Q2; however, management provided a cautious outlook for the second half of 2024. Comments from GM mirrored those of other OEMs and auto suppliers, leading investors to believe the automotive cycle has peaked. We believe this is an overreaction, and we continue to view GM as an attractive investment. We like GM for many reasons. First, we believe GM has leading market positions in its main business segments. Second, the valuation is extremely attractive. Finally, it is a strong free cash flow generator, and the management team is committed to repurchasing their undervalued shares.\u201d\n\nOverall GM ranks 1st on our list of the most undervalued EV stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Founded in 1992, Air Support is an independent maintenance company (MRO) specializing in engine equipment repair and maintenance. With only about ten employees, Sabine Tertre joined the company in 1999 and, after progressively advancing within it, became its president in 2017. The company now has 200 employees and nearly 200 clients spread across 40 countries, and Sabine Tertre currently holds 70% of the capital. Air Support is a recognized partner supporting major aerospace players such as Safran Aircraft Engines, General Electric, Air France Industries, to name a few. In 2024, the company aims for 55 million in revenue.\n\nPortrait of an engaged and passionate woman for whom ?nothing is guaranteed.?\n\nA graduate of the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Commerce in Pau, Sabine Tertre started her career in the aerospace sector in 1994 while pursuing a work-study program at the aerospace design office CASO (acquired by Labinal, now Safran Engineering). She was welcomed by its founder Guy Servanty and attached to the sales department led by Bruno Bergoend, the former president of UIMM MP-Occitanie. This professional organization in metallurgy aims to represent the interests of industrial companies, support them daily, and develop the industry's appeal across all audiences.\n\nCurrently, the organization comprises 500 member companies representing 75,000 employees in sectors such as aerospace and space, metallurgy, mechanics, energy equipment, railway, electrical, electronics, digital and IT, automotive, medical, etc.\n\nSabine later joined an SME specializing in technical documentation for the army and aerospace as a sales manager before joining Air Support's teams in 1999.\n\nSabine Tertre is also an engaged woman: Today, Sabine Tertre has just been re-elected vice-president of UIMM MP-Occitanie and will continue to chair the Industrial Development Commission of UIMM Occitanie. She is also in charge of relations with the regional network. She will succeed Bruno Bergoend at Medef Occitanie and also becomes leader of France Industrie Occitanie, which brings together ten industrial sectors.\n\nAir Support is also a member of GIFAS, Club AEROGERS, the Entrepreneurs of the Gascon Toulousaine Association (EGT), and the Gers Recruits club.\n\nShe received the Knight of the National Order of Merit medal on February 9, 2023.\n\nAir Support\n\nFounded in 1992 near the final assembly lines of Airbus in Colomiers, the SME is what is known as an MRO, a subcontractor specialized in aerospace maintenance for major aerospace players such as engine manufacturers Safran and General Electric, but also major MROs like Air France Industries, aircraft manufacturers (ATR, Embraer, Dassault) and, less frequently, airlines. Since 2013, it has been established in Pujaudran (Gers).\n\nSabine Tertre joined Air Support in 1999 as an administrative and financial manager. She then held various roles and climbed all the ranks before becoming the general manager in 2004.\n\n?When I arrived, there were about ten of us. Everything had to be done; going from 100 to 150 is always easier than from 10 to 100. The whole company needed structuring, support services, purchasing, human resources, sales, etc. We started from almost nothing to become what we are today, an organized company with a functioning model and structured services capable of absorbing stronger growth.\n\n\n\nI held almost all positions, from production manager to human resources, through purchasing. There are phases where you must know how to evolve and constantly question yourself. I know the ins and outs of the company very well, which allows creating a model that works and is especially very flexible in relation to variations in demand.? she said of her experience.\n\nOn June 30, 2017, at 42 years old, Sabine Tertre took the helm of Air Support.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Air Support completed an LBO, allowing Sabine Tertre to reluer. The leader now owns nearly 70% of the company's capital, while iXO Private Equity (already present) and BNP Paribas Development (new entrant) hold about 15% each. The LBO was supported by a banking pool consisting of the Caisse d?\u00c9pargne Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, the Banque Populaire Occitane, and LCL.\n\nToday, Air Support's roadmap now calls for strengthening its workforce. ?For this, we are working on our employer brand and focusing on professional environment immersion,? explains the manager. ?In this context, we recently organized the event 'Parents in Business!', opening our doors for an evening to students from Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9ritier College, in L'Isle-Jourdain, as well as their parents, to allow them to discover the aerospace industry. The idea is mainly to break prejudices.\n\nIn strong growth, Air Support continues its investments\n\nAfter navigating a turbulent period due to Covid, the SME is regaining altitude. Last year, it significantly exceeded its pre-covid revenue of 26 million euros to reach 35 million euros. As of March 31, it closed with a turnover of 47 million euros, a 35% increase, and for the current fiscal year, it anticipates a minimum growth of 20%. ?This increase is due to our excellent operational performance. We are recognized for being among the best performers in our market. We deliver 98% to 100% of the equipment we repair on time. Safran even rewarded us with a second Best MRO Supplier Award in 2022. Very few have achieved this award: it is very difficult to earn this kind of recognition,? explains Sabine Tertre, the president.\n\nIn June 2024, Air Support began construction of a 1,800m2 positive energy building allowing it to double its production and test areas. The delivery is planned in two phases, early and mid-2025. ?In total, this is a 4.5 million euro investment, says Sabine Tertre. In parallel, we are injecting 700k euros into a new oil test bench with support from the Region.",

The order was issued on Feb. 27.\n\nOn the same day, the MPSC also disallowed $7,537,566 in unsupported costs requested by DTM Michigan Lateral Company, a pipeline operator primarily serving DTE Gas.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s intervention thoroughly examined these issues, preventing these costs from being passed on to DTE Gas customers.\n\nTogether, the two orders result in a total savings of $41,312,294 for Michigan ratepayers.\n\nDTE serves 1.3 million natural gas customers statewide and provides electricity to about 2.3 million customers in Southeast Michigan.\n\nSince taking office, Nessel has helped save Michigan ratepayers nearly $3.7 billion.",

These professionals lead the charge in the development of new vehicles and technologies, ensuring high standards and groundbreaking advancements.\n\nAt General Motors, the engineering team behind Chevrolet\u2019s entire all-electric vehicle portfolio is led by four talented women. Together, they exemplify how women in science, technology, engineering, art, and math \u2013 or STEAM \u2013 are shaping the next generation of automobiles.\n\nMarisa Cullens: Blazer EV\n\nMichigan native Marisa Cullens began her automotive career at Kettering University, formerly the General Motors Institute, where she first experienced what a GM career at GM could be.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather worked for GM as a chief engineer, and also went to GMI,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowing up, my dad always told me about my grandfather\u2019s rewarding GM career. I don\u2019t think he ever had any idea how closely I would be following in his footsteps.\u201d\n\nCullens went on to earn both a master's degree in engineering science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and an MBA from Indiana University\u2019s Kelly School of Business, setting her up for a diverse career with roles in body and exterior engineering, safety performance, and validation, as well as corporate accounting.\n\nShe joined GM's program team in 2019, where she spent time living in Shanghai, while traveling frequently to Yantai, Seoul, Ramos, and San Luis Potosi to launch GM's vehicles. In 2022, she took on her current assignment: chief engineer for the Chevy Blazer EV .\n\nKristin Cermak: Equinox EV\n\nBorn and raised in Michigan, Kristin Cermak has deep family roots in the automotive industry stemming from her mom and grandparents. Her 17-year career at GM includes three summers as an intern while earning her bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering and master\u2019s degree in global automotive manufacturing engineering at the University of Michigan. She later earned her MBA from Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business.\n\nCermak has held numerous roles across manufacturing engineering, operations, product engineering and GM\u2019s aerodynamic and climatic wind tunnels. She\u2019s supported vehicle launches across the Chevy portfolio, including the Chevy Volt, Silverado, and Corvette C8.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to see a vehicle you worked on driving down the road and know you had a part in bringing it to the customer,\u201d Cermak says. \u201cOur customers are the reason I do what I do every day.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Cermak became chief engineer in global electric propulsion systems, working on GM\u2019s EV battery platforms. A few years later, she accepted her current position as chief engineer for the Chevy Equinox EV.\n\nJoan Petit: Chevy BrightDrop 400 and 600\n\nAn Indiana native, Joan Petit earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering from Purdue before adding a master's degree in energy systems engineering from the University of Michigan. While she hadn\u2019t originally envisioned herself working at an automaker, Petit says she\u2019s always had an interest in consumer products - and that led her to a career at GM.\n\n\u201cIt amazes me how much coordination and teamwork it takes to develop, build and launch a vehicle \u2013 and they keep getting better and more advanced,\u201d she says. \u201cFiguring out what our customers want and how to delight them is what excites me every day.\u201d\n\nIn her 17 years at GM, Petit has held positions in transmission engineering, program engineering, and quality management. She supported the launch of the all-electric Cadillac LYRIQ before taking her current role as chief engineer for the Chevy BrightDrop 400 and 600 electric delivery vans in 2024.\n\nKathy Gillespie: Silverado EV\n\nA Michigan native born into a GM family, Kathy Gillespie was drawn to the work at the company after seeing the \u201ccool cars\u201d her GM employee dad brought home. She joined GM in 1990 as a summer intern and has held engineering positions across many different product teams ever since.\n\nOver her long career at GM, Gillespie has played many roles: integrating GM's first adaptive cruise control system; integrating high voltage batteries on the Chevrolet Volt; and serving as chief engineer at BrightDrop. In 2023, she became chief engineer for the Chevrolet Silverado EV .\n\nJust last month, Gillespie took on a new challenge: she\u2019s now chief engineer for Cadillac CELESTIQ , an ultra-luxury, hand-built electric sedan\n\n\"Having the opportunity to work on different vehicles and technologies continues to fuel my curiosity to this day,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThe teams I've worked with have so much talent and passion, it\u2019s no surprise that we deliver such captivating products.\u201d\n\nLearn more about careers in GM engineering at careers.gm.com .",

As part of the partnership, GE Vernova will provide AWS with new offerings across a broad scope of solutions to electrify and decarbonize data centers throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, including electrification systems coupled with turnkey substation which enable AWS data center connectivity to the grid.\n\nThe two companies will partner on expanding major electrical equipment, project management and construction support across data center sites globally.\n\nWhile GE Vernova will continue a focus on delivering its natural gas-fired turbines for data center projects, it also will collaborate with AWS on enhancing the commercial path forward for onshore wind development. GE Vernova and AWS will explore additional opportunities for the former to provide power generation equipment and services to AWS as well as work with GE Vernova\u2019s accelerator businesses \u2013 Advanced Research, Consulting Services, and Financial Services \u2013 to advance energy transition innovation, research, project development, and financing.\n\n\u201cWe believe that GE Vernova is well positioned through its broad portfolio of energy products and services to help AWS obtain reliable, cost effective, and more sustainable electricity for its data centers in support of their growth objectives,\u201d said Pablo Koziner, Chief Commercial Officer, GE Vernova, in a statement.\n\nAWS will provide GE Vernova with cloud services solutions to proceed with its cloud migration and digital innovation efforts, including through generative AI (artificial intelligence).

Saddled with high maintenance costs, coal plants were shuttered throughout the developed world. In their place rose new fleets of wind turbines, dotting the American plains from Texas to Iowa. In Europe, wind power blossomed onshore but also extended its reach offshore, thriving in the Continent\u2019s notoriously stormy seas. But as coal plant retirements accelerated, the power sector needed a replacement for this lost capacity, a solution that would be \u201cfirm\u201d enough to stand in for coal, but versatile enough to work in close partnership with wind power, as well as solar, with their fluctuating electrical output.\n\nIt was at this juncture, right around 2010\u20132012, \u201cthat the company started to see the need for a more efficient gas turbine,\u201d says Ty Remington, gas power sales executive at GE Vernova. \u201cAnd so we launched the HA gas turbine product line and began our journey.\u201d According to Remington, the first HA units were delivered to France, Japan, and the U.S., and that kicked off a decade-long rollout as the HA series helped grids navigate the new landscape. Today the HA product portfolio, comprising the 7HA and 9HA product lines, has accumulated an astonishing 3 million hours of operation, from just 116 units spread across the globe.

Without question, the HA is a nimble workhorse, but down at the detailed level, the HA product portfolio has proven to be customizable to run on alternative fuels like hydrogen, can be retrofitted with an exhaust system for carbon capture, is modular for easy installation and maintenance, and, most important of all, can quickly increase or decrease its output \u2014 a critical 30-minute, on/off capability that can really strut its stuff in grids where wind and solar electricity rises and falls. To understand more fully the role natural gas turbines are playing in the energy transition, however, it\u2019s not enough to know that wind comes and goes, the sun shines only during the day, and natural gas turbines fill the gaps in between.\n\nConsider the dramatic changes to power grids in both Europe and the U.S. during the decade since the HA began its ascent. According to EIA data, in 2014 in the U.S., coal provided 1,580 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power, and wind and solar combined to provide 210 TWh. By 2024 coal had fallen to just 650 TWh and combined wind and solar had soared to 740 TWh. The story was similar in Europe: According to EI Statistical Review, coal power fell from 1,017 TWh to 530 TWh between 2014 and 2023, and combined wind and solar soared from 363 to 909 TWh. Natural gas, with its far lower carbon emissions than coal, helped solve the remainder of the equation.\n\nFor Remington, this confluence of the decline of coal and the rise of renewables was the crucible in which the HA was forged.\n\nTechnology Built for These Times\n\nAnd the HA journey continues. Today, the rise of AI computational demand, along with the supertrend of electrification, has forced the IEA to raise its growth forecasts for global power again and again. In its latest report, released in February, the IEA saw 4.3% global growth last year, and projected 4.0% growth for this year and next year too \u2014 one of the strongest sustained growth advances in many years. As GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik recently wrote in an op-ed, \u201cThe International Energy Agency recently said the world will need to build as much capacity in the next five years as the U.S. and Europe did in the last 136 years.\u201d While strong growth presents a challenge, it\u2019s also an opportunity, according to Strazik, who said at last year\u2019s Climate Week and UN General Assembly conference that \u201cgrowth is the only thing that\u2019s going to give us a chance to address\u201d the climate challenge.\n\nAnd growth is exactly how the HA, according to Remington, will march forward in its journey from 3 million to 10 million hours of runtime. The HA order book is quickly expanding, and GE Vernova is investing heavily in HA output capacity at its Greenville, South Carolina, facility. According to Remington, in the recent past it was generally an 18-to-24-month cycle from the signing of the contract to the delivery of new power equipment. But with so much demand, that delivery timeline has started to expand, and he says the goal of the company\u2019s investment is to help ensure that customers are able to receive the products. \u201cThe power industry has accelerated incredibly fast, just in the past year and a half,\u201d he says. Not coincidentally, the first AI chatbots started to appear just two years ago and were a hit with consumers.\n\nRemington says it\u2019s not just raw demand for more global power that will drive the HA forward, but the portfolio\u2019s range of capabilities, which are now coming into view. For example, at the new Net-Zero Teesside Power station in the U.K., GE Vernova will supply a 9HA.02 turbine to be customized to intersect with a leading-edge carbon capture system, a testament to the HA\u2019s flexibility. In a world of robust data center growth, where operators may have trouble finding a connection to the grid, they can choose instead to site the HA directly on their property, in what\u2019s known as a behind-the-meter configuration. Can\u2019t plug in to the grid? Build your own.\n\nLooking ahead, Remington discerns that most of the dynamics that got the HA to its current milestone are still seen today. Electrification of residential and industrial segments, fast-growing wind and solar that require firming, and still more coal plant closures are all set to accelerate in the years ahead, and on top of that there is now an enormous AI load fueling demand. \u201cEven if you took just a fraction of the load growth currently forecasted,\u201d he says, \u201cthe numbers are still astounding.\u201d",

            "content": "GE's Warranty Expenses by Industry: As of April 2024, GE is now three separate companies: GE Aerospace (the successor to the parent), GE Vernova (formerly GE Power & GE Renewable Energy), and GE HealthCare. Now that each spin-off has filed its first annual report, we can break down the former GE's warranty expenses by industry. Broadly speaking, 55% to 65% of GE's product warranty expenses were from the power generation industry, 15% to 25% were from aerospace, and about 20% were from healthcare.\n\nBack in 2004, warranty industry veteran Terry Hawkins told us he believed that GE invented the extended warranty in 1935, when its Electric Refrigeration Department sold a five-year extended warranty plan for the Monitor Top Refrigerator. Over two decades later, it's still the oldest service contract we've heard of.\n\nGeneral Electric, its products, and its warranties have changed so much since that interview with Hawkins 20 years ago. In the wake of the Great Recession, GE started divesting significant portions of its business. First, GE sold half of NBC Universal to Comcast in 2011, and then the other half in 2013.\n\nThe GE Capital division was hit especially hard by the Great Recession, prompting the company's retreat from finance and re-focus on industry. GE divested the GE Capital Retail Finance Corp. as Synchrony Financial in 2014. In 2015, GE sold the majority of its property business to Wells Fargo and Blackstone. Also in 2015, GE Capital's private equity lending portfolio was sold to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.\n\nThen, in 2016, it sold the GE Appliance division (including licensing the brand name) to the China-based Haier Group. Next, in 2019, it sold the GE Transportation division to Wabtec (Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.). In 2020, it sold the GE Lighting division to Savant Systems Inc., a divestment that meant GE no longer sold any consumer goods, nor any financial or investment services.\n\nUltimately, GE's plan for recovery from the Great Recession was attacked from two sides, with its Aviation division devastated by the pandemic, and its Renewable Energy division facing unexpected challenges with its wind turbines. In November 2021, GE announced a plan to split into three separate companies, which was completed in April 2024.\n\nFirst, GE renamed its Aviation division to GE Aerospace in July 2022. Next, on January 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. was spun-off from the parent GE.\n\nIn early 2024, the GE Renewable Energy, GE Power, GE Digital, and GE Energy Financial Services divisions were combined into GE Vernova. Then, on April 2, 2024, GE Vernova was spun-off from the parent GE, which renamed itself to GE Aerospace.\n\nIn February 2025, GE Vernova published its first annual report, and GE Aerospace published its first annual report since the spin-offs occurred.\n\nWe perused the annual and quarterly reports of GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, GE HealthCare, and the former General Electric, and gathered three key warranty metrics: the amount of claims paid, the amount of accruals made, and the end-balance of the warranty reserve fund. In addition, we gathered data on each corporate entity's product sales revenue, and used these to calculate two additional warranty statistics: claims as a percentage of sales (the claims rate), and accruals as a percentage of sales (the accrual rate).\n\nGE only reported its warranty data annually, rather than quarterly, so we've had to wait until now to get a breakdown of what percentage of the former GE's product warranty costs came from each industry division. GE Aerospace and GE Vernova have followed the reporting style of their former parent, but GE HealthCare reports its warranty expenses on a quarterly basis.\n\nOn the bright side, conveniently enough, each new spin-off provided historical data for us in their 2024 annual reports. GE Aerospace and GE Vernova both provided product warranty data for 2022, 2023, and 2024 in their 2024 annual reports. GE HealthCare published its first annual report for 2022, and also provided two previous years of data.\n\nThus, we have annual GE HealthCare data starting in 2020, and GE Vernova and GE Aerospace data starting in 2022. For 2022 and 2023, we have the historical data provided by GE Aerospace and GE Vernova in their 2024 annual reports, along with the data previously reported by GE in its 2022 and 2023 annual reports. After divesting GE HealthCare, GE updated its historical totals to be sans warranty expenses from that division. GE Aerospace similarly released historical numbers that exclude the expenses of GE Vernova, even from before the two split up.\n\nTherefore, 2022 is a very unique year in these data, since we have data available from the 2022 GE annual report, along with historical data provided by GE HealthCare, GE Vernova, and GE Aerospace in their 2024 annual reports. Since 2022 was before any of the spin-offs occurred, this is a wonderful insight into the composition of GE's warranty expenses by industry before the breakup, something that was always an opaque mystery to us.\n\nWarranty Claims Totals\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the breakdown of the warranty expenses of GE, and its subsequent three spin-offs, from 2015 to 2024, in Figure 1.\n\nIn the following three charts, based on the color of each division's logos, the former GE is represented by light blue, the successor GE Aerospace is represented by dark blue, GE Vernova is dark green, and GE HealthCare is purple.\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe GE Spin-Offs:\n\nClaims Paid by GE & Successor Companies\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, 2015-2024)\n\nIn 2022, GE reported paying $967 million in product warranty claims.\n\nIn its 2022 annual report, GE HealthCare reported paying $199 million in warranty claims. Since the spin-off of GE HealthCare technically took place in January 2023, these funds are double-counted in the GE and GE HealthCare annual reports for 2022.\n\nThus, we can do a little math, and calculate that GE paid $768 million in warranty claims between the divisions that later split into Aerospace and Vernova. $199 million is about 20% of $967 million, so in 2022, one-fifth of the warranty claims paid by GE were for products sold by the GE HealthCare division.\n\nIn their 2024 annual reports, GE Aerospace and GE Vernova both provided their own warranty data for 2022 and 2023, which differed than those reported by the former parent GE back in its 2022 annual report.\n\nIn their 2024 annual reports, GE Vernova reported paying $617 million in warranty claims in 2022, and GE Aerospace reported paying $162 million in warranty claims in 2022.\n\nOur readers gifted at addition will notice that $617 million (Vernova), plus $162 million (Aerospace), plus $199 million (HealthCare), does not equal the original $967 million figure reported by GE back in 2022. The sum of these three numbers is $978 million. However, what's $11 million among friends? We'll base our proportions on our new sum of $978 million in claims paid by GE in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, GE Vernova products accounted for 63% of all warranty claims paid by the parent GE, GE Aerospace products accounted for 17% of warranty claims, and GE HealthCare products accounted for 20%.\n\nIt's quite possible that the GE Aerospace warranty claims costs were so low in 2022 because sales across the aviation sector were driven down so much by the pandemic.\n\nIn 2023, the parent GE reported paying $886 million in warranty claims. Since GE HealthCare was spun-off in January of that year, this figure only includes the warranty claims paid by GE Vernova and GE Aerospace.\n\nAccording to their respective 2024 annual reports, GE Vernova paid $719 million in claims in 2023, and GE Aerospace paid $167 million in claims.\n\nThus, in 2023, 81% of the parent GE's warranty claims payments were for products sold by GE Vernova, and 19% of GE's claims paid were for GE Aerospace products.\n\nLet's take this a step further, and add in GE HealthCare's warranty claims paid for 2023. GE HealthCare paid $218 million in claims in 2023. Added to the former parent GE's $886 million, we have $1.104 billion in warranty claims paid across these three GE-branded divisions.\n\nBased on that total, in 2023, GE Vernova accounted for 65% of claims paid, GE Aerospace accounted for 15% of claims, and GE HealthCare accounted for 20% of claims. That's just about the same split as we saw in 2022.\n\nWe can see in Figure 1 that GE Aerospace's claims payments nearly doubled from 2023 to 2024. So, even though the three divisions were officially all split up in April 2024, let's do some more math just to see if we find the same proportions between the warranty expenses of the three companies.\n\nIn 2024, GE Vernova paid $686 million in claims, GE Aerospace paid $321 million, and GE HealthCare paid $220 million. Based on these figures, GE Vernova accounted for 55% of claims paid in 2024, GE Aerospace accounted for 26% of claims, and GE HealthCare accounted for 18%.\n\nOverall, for the three years for which we have these breakdowns between the three divisions, GE Vernova accounted for 55% to 65% of total warranty claims paid, GE Aerospace accounted for 15% to 26% of claims, and GE HealthCare accounted for 18% to 20% of claims.\n\nWarranty Accrual Totals\n\nFigure 2 shows the total warranty accruals made by GE and its three successor spin-offs, from 2015 to 2024.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe GE Spin-Offs:\n\nAccruals Made by GE & Successor Companies\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, 2015-2024)\n\nWe're going to do a similar set of calculations for accruals as we just did for claims.\n\nIn 2022, GE reported setting aside $1.319 billion in warranty accruals.\n\nIn its 2022 annual report, GE HealthCare reported accruing $238 million for warranty. And in their 2024 annual reports, GE Vernova reported $928 million in warranty accruals in 2022, and GE Aerospace reported $180 million in accruals in 2022.\n\nAdded together, these three numbers total $1.346 billion. Again, we'll ignore the $27 million discrepancy, that's small change to us. But we'll use the higher total as the denominator for our calculations.\n\nSo in 2022, GE Vernova products accounted for 69% of warranty accruals, GE Aerospace products accounted for just 13% of accruals, and GE HealthCare accounted for 18% of accruals.\n\nIn 2023, the parent GE reported $961 million in accruals. Since GE HealthCare was divested in January 2023, this figure comprises of accruals made for GE Vernova and GE Aerospace products.\n\nIn their 2024 annual reports, GE Vernova reported $684 million in warranty accruals made in 2023, and GE Aerospace reported $277 million in accruals in 2023. That means that in 2023, GE Vernova accounted for 71% of the parent GE's total warranty accruals, while GE Aerospace accounted for 29% of accruals.\n\nIf we add the parent GE's $961 million in accruals made in 2023 to GE HealthCare's $216 million in accruals made that year, we get a total of $1.177 billion.\n\nBased on that total, in 2023, GE Vernova accounted for 58% of accruals, GE Aerospace accounted for 24% of accruals, and GE HealthCare accounted for 18%.\n\nIn 2024, GE Vernova accrued $687, GE Aerospace accrued $275 million, and GE HealthCare accrued $202 million. Based on these figures, the proportions for 2024 accruals break down as: 59% GE Vernova, 24% GE Aerospace, and 17% GE HealthCare.\n\nOverall, for the three years, based on all three divisions as parts of a whole, GE Vernova accounted for 58% to 69% of warranty accruals, GE Aerospace accounted for 13% to 24% of accruals, and GE HealthCare accounted for 17% to 18% of accruals.\n\nTotal Warranty Reserves Held\n\nFigure 3 shows the warranty reserve year-end-balances for GE and its three spin-off divisions, from 2015 to 2024.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe GE Spin-Offs:\n\nReserves Held by GE & Successor Companies\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, 2015-2024)\n\nAt the end of 2022, GE HealthCare reported a warranty reserve balance of $193 million. In their 2024 annual reports, GE Vernova reported a 2022 warranty reserve fund end-balance of $1.430 billion, and GE Aerospace reported a 2022 end-balance of $528 million.\n\nProportionally, GE Vernova accounted for 66% of the parent GE's warranty reserves at the end of 2022, GE Aerospace accounted for 25%, and GE HealthCare accounted for 9%.\n\nAt the end of 2023, GE Vernova held $1.414 billion in reserves, GE Aerospace held $639 million, and GE HealthCare held $192 million. Proportionally, GE Vernova held 62% of total reserves between the three divisions, GE Aerospace held 28% of reserves, and GE HealthCare held 9%.\n\nAt the end of 2024, GE Vernova held $1.370 billion in reserves, GE Aerospace held $592 million, and GE HealthCare held $168 million. Proportionally, GE Vernova held 64% of total reserves between the three divisions, GE Aerospace held 28%, and GE HealthCare held 8%.\n\nOverall, GE Vernova held 63% to 66% of the parent GE's total warranty reserves, GE Aerospace held 25% to 28%, and GE HealthCare held 8% to 9%.",

Stock prices fell drastically, more plants closed, and the company was dismembered and never the same again.\n\nHopefully, we as a country are not in for the same thing.

            "content": "In 2024, PGE saw increases in clean energy resources, large customer participation in voluntary clean energy programs, record fish returns at hydro facilities and increases in employee volunteerism.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore., March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 Portland General Electric (PGE) today reported a record 45% of the energy it generated and procured came from non-carbon-emitting resources in 2024. This represents a 7% compounded growth rate in PGE\u2019s non-emitting resource mix since 2020, building on the company\u2019s commitment to reach net-zero by 2040.\n\nThe data was reported in the company\u2019s 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, \u201cAdvancing Toward a Clean Energy Future,\u201d which details the company\u2019s progress in creating resilient energy, thriving communities, and ethical governance.\n\nThe increase in clean energy is partly due to new renewable resources including the Clearwater Wind Energy Center and battery storage systems which brought increased availability and reliability to PGE\u2019s energy mix. These systems, along with the rest of PGE\u2019s technology and infrastructure, work together to provide reliable, clean energy even when the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n\n\u201cWhile we work to meet the challenges of Oregon\u2019s ambitious clean energy targets, we also remain firmly committed to providing safe, reliable power as affordably as possible,\u201d said Kristen Sheeran, PGE\u2019s Vice President of Policy and Resource Planning.\n\nThe role of PGE customers in support of a modern, reliable grid also increased in 2024. Twenty-four percent of PGE\u2019s residential households participated in voluntary programs to shift energy use and lend flexibility to the grid during times of peak demand. The result, during a two-day heatwave in July, was a more than 100-megawatt reduction in demand, which PGE equated to the energy used by 90,000 homes over a four-hour period.\n\n2024 was also the 15th year in a row in which PGE has achieved a Number One ranking from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the largest customer participation in a renewable energy program among U.S. electric utilities.\n\nAdditionally, strong environmental stewardship at PGE\u2019s hydro facilities led to record-setting fish returns on the Clackamas and Deschutes Rivers. This includes the highest steelhead return to Round Butte Dam since dams were completed in the 1960s.\n\nEmployee and corporate giving also increased. The total company charitable giving from corporate contributions, PGE Foundation, current and retired employees and company match was $5.5 million in 2024. PGE awarded 55 scholarships, focused on higher education for underrepresented students, women and students with demonstrated financial need. Employees and retirees donated nearly 23,000 total volunteer hours, and 66% of PGE employees participated in charitable giving and/or volunteerism.\n\nTo read the full 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, \u201cAdvancing Toward a Clean Energy Future,\u201d visit portlandgeneral.com/sustainability.\n\nAbout Portland General Electric Company\n\nPortland General Electric (NYSE: POR) is an integrated energy company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity to over 950,000 customers serving an area of 1.9 million Oregonians.

            "content": "Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nHow far off is Portland General Electric Company ( NYSE:POR ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nThe US$48.79 analyst price target for POR is 42% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nStory Continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.8%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$479m\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (6.3%\u2013 2.8%) = US$14b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$14b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$7.6b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$9.3b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$45.2, the company appears quite good value at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\n\nNYSE:POR Discounted Cash Flow March 4th 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Portland General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.816. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Portland General Electric\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nWeakness\n\nInterest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

She is aged eighty at this point. Her son, Arne\u0301, downloads WhatsApp onto her mobile phone and within the space of minutes, I have three missed calls from her. I dial back hurriedly; she is a little out of breath. Sonia informs me that she has just returned from fulfilling an important aspect of her daily routine\u2014walking from her loft, which also houses her studio, in Tribeca, which she has occupied since the 1970s, down to the banks of the Hudson River.\n\nAs she describes the rippling effects of the water, I begin to mentally conjure her abstract paintings, which often resemble language, swelling and subsiding into the skin of the canvas. The history of the Hudson River evades our conversation, but the context of the waterway as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York does not escape me. Nor does its colonial history as a location for Dutch settlers, and its presence as a site of contamination\u2014victim to the likes of General Electric (GE)\u2014instigating long-term ecological concern.\n\nInstead, Sonia gleans a metaphor of the shapely water as suggestive of alphabetical forms\u2014the intimation of language is prescient for someone who has lived most of her professional life in a country\u2014the United States\u2014where communication is performed through speech acts that diverge from her mother tongue: Armenian\n\nPersistent and inquisitive, the artist is curious about the movements in my life\u2014querying various forms of identification, so that, one assumes, the storyteller in her, can determine how best to construct her own tale. \u201cI was raised in a very strict household: eight girls and two boys,\u201d she begins, as the pendulum swings back. She was born Sonia Amirian in Arak, Iran, in 1942, to a father of Armenian descent. Her ancestors had moved from what would become the Armenian region near Isfahan in the early seventeenth century, during the Safavid dynasty, forming the city of Jolfa.\n\nSonia\u2019s father insisted upon a form of studiousness that she felt oppressive, so exit strategies brewed in her mind. She gasps in delight as she recollects laying in a small nook on the balcony of her family\u2019s home at night. Then a teenager, she sought to invent her own world, one which unfolded in poetry\u2014her first point of fixation. Her words, authored in Armenian (the language spoken at home), began with reflections on nature, before turning inwards: \u201cTo wring, to tear apart old memories/ To leave home consciously,/ To walk until dawn,/ And with all one\u2019s being.\u201d Her poems, like her paintings, all of which are untitled, authored in interleaving verse, mostly remain untranslated. All are undated. Their origin can only be determined. Her late husband, Edward Balassanian, nonetheless, insisted that two collected anthologies were published. One in 1982 and 1991, respectively.

            "content": "Bill would create $1 billion fund to aid utilities in paying wildfire victims\n\nAfter a series of low-profile meetings with Salem power brokers and utility officials, state Rep. Pam Marsh (D-Ashland) confirms to the Oregon Journalism Project that she has crafted legislation to create a $1 billion fund to help utilities pay damages to customers hurt by utility-caused wildfires.\n\nIt is the second bombshell utility bill the moderate Democrat has unveiled in a week. On Tuesday, she introduced House Bill 3666, which would create a wildfire certification program. Critics charge that the bill is an attempt by utilities to shield themselves from wildfire-related lawsuits by pointing to their state certification as evidence they did all they could to prevent conflagration.\n\nOne of those utilities is PacifiCorp, which is locked in a debilitating and, so far, losing legal battle with hundreds of its customers for its principal role in the massive Labor Day fires of 2020.\n\nMarsh confirmed that the concepts for the fund and the certification program came out of the series of meetings from September to January with PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric and senior state officials. Attending at least some of the meetings were Karin Power, then a senior adviser to Gov. Tina Kotek; Andrew Stolfi, head of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services; officials from the Oregon Public Utility Commission; and at least six representatives from two of the state\u2019s largest investor-owned utilities, PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric.\n\nA summary of the issues circulated among the invitees in September made clear where its sympathies lay. \u201cWildfire-related civil lawsuits also pose enormous litigation costs to utilities,\u201d the memo read. \u201cIn these suits, utilities face an unclear and rapidly changing negligence standard set by juries. The duty of care to which juries may hold utilities responsible may be higher than even industry-leading utilities can meet in practice. This uncertainty, combined with the scale of potential damages and the potential number of litigants, creates a virtually uncapped liability that can outstrip the value of the company\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nThe document, obtained by the Oregon Journalism Project, was authored by Power and Michael Grant, a longtime employee at the PUC.\n\nAt the time, Power was a senior adviser to Kotek. In January, the governor appointed Power to the Public Utility Commission.\n\nIt\u2019s been four years since the cataclysmic Labor Day fires. Strong winds from the east knocked down trees and branches, which in turn knocked down live power lines onto tinder-dry forests.\n\nAs OJP previously reported, PacifiCorp rejected pleas from senior state officials that it shut off the flow of electricity\u2014to effectively deenergize its power lines\u2014given the dangerous weather. Hours later, fire engulfed parts of the Santiam, Umpqua, Clackamas and Salmon river basins.\n\nIn 2023, an Oregon jury found that PacifiCorp was reckless and acted with \u201cgross negligence\u201d in the lead-up to the 2020 Labor Day fires. The jury awarded damages that could eventually mean a $6 million payday for each of the approximately 1,500 plaintiffs, which would make it the most costly litigation in Oregon history.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Department of Justice added to PacifiCorp\u2019s legal woes. The feds filed a $900 million civil lawsuit, claiming the utility\u2019s negligence caused a different 2020 fire in Southern Oregon\u2019s Umpqua River Basin.\n\nPacifiCorp says it faces legal claims in excess of $45 billion. Its debt has been downgraded by ratings agencies and its liquidity badly eroded.\n\nIn the document circulated at this fall\u2019s meetings, Power and Grant argue wildfires endanger the entire state\u2019s economic health.\n\n\u201cThis risk is especially acute for utilities, threatening affordability for customers and utilities\u2019 ability to meet customers\u2019 needs for growth, reliability and clean energy,\u201d they write. \u201cAs a result, the state economy is at risk if action is not taken to stabilize the situation\u2014both for victims of wildfire and for utilities providing an essential service.\u201d\n\nThe same document floats the plan for a catastrophic wildfire fund to provide \u201cpayouts to property owners impacted by wildfire.\u201d The fund could be modeled after SAIF Corp., the state\u2019s semi-private workers\u2019 compensation insurance operation.\n\nAs to funding such a vehicle, the document is vague. It states only that a fund could be capitalized with contributions from \u201cthe state, electric utilities and others (tbd).\u201d\n\nMarsh says the document was an early draft and is no longer entirely accurate. Taxpayer dollars, for example, would not be used in the formation of a victims\u2019 fund.\n\nRatepayer advocates hate the idea. Customers are already struggling as utility bills continue to escalate. Disconnects due to nonpayment have soared at both PacifiCorp and PGE.\n\nPacifiCorp, for example, disconnected 20,662 customers through the first 10 months of 2024, according to the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board. In all of 2023, it disconnected 7,935. In the year before, 5,355.\n\nBob Jenks, head of the CUB, says the surging disconnect numbers are strictly a matter of money. In the 28 months ended in January 2024, PacifiCorp rates jumped 35% and PGE\u2019s increased 43%.\n\nWhat exactly the utilities would get in return for creating a victims\u2019 fund is not yet clear. Talk is rife in green energy and public power circles that PacifiCorp and PGE want some sort of statutory limit on their legal liability in the case of wildfire.\n\nJenks says he has not seen the bill. He walked away from the meetings thinking that the utility liability caps were part of the final version of the proposal. After he was quoted to that effect in an earlier version of this story, he said he was informed by group members that the liability caps had been removed from the final version.\n\nFor the hundreds of people who have spent the past four years fighting PacifiCorp in court, the idea of having to contribute to a PacifiCorp victims\u2019 fund is almost beyond comprehension. That was the message from the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association. The powerful attorneys\u2019 group said it was not invited to attend the meetings. But it demanded access after getting tipped off that lawmakers and PUC members were meeting with utility officials.\n\nRep. Marsh has already unveiled one bill coming out of those invitation-only meetings. Her HB 3666 would create a certification program in which the state Public Utility Commission would grant utilities a wildfire mitigation certificate if they were deemed in compliance. Oregon Capital Chronicle first reported on HB 3666 earlier this week.\n\nThe measure was widely pilloried by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and renewable energy advocates as a thinly veiled effort to shield the utilities from customer lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe long and short of it is, if the utility gets the gold badge from the PUC, their behavior is deemed reasonable and then they are effectively insulated from legal action,\u201d says Derek Johnson, a Eugene lawyer.\n\nOthers wonder how vigorously the certificate program would be enforced. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the PUC will ever reject one of these applications,\u201d says Carra Sahler, a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School and director of the Green Energy Institute. \u201cSo what is this doing, really? At some level, it is protection against litigation. It appears to be a piece of evidence that a utility could use in the courtroom.\u201d\n\nThe utilities disagree.\n\n\u201cThe safety certificate legislation is about setting a safety standard, checking the work of utilities with respect to wildfire prevention and keeping customers and communities safe,\u201d says PacifiCorp spokesman Simon Gutierrez. \u201cThis legislation is not about immunity from future litigation.\u201d\n\nA work session on the bill took place Monday, March 3, before the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment.\n\nThis story was produced by the Oregon Journalism Project, a nonprofit investigative newsroom for the state of Oregon.

Neal, president of Hyosung HICO.Neal projects that Hyosung\u2019s transformer sales and output in the US would beat those of the market\u2019s current top two, Siemens and General Electric (GE), within two years to become the largest US transformer producer and seller.His confidence lies in the company\u2019s huge five-year transformer order backlog, driven by strong replacement demand for aging power equipment and installation demand from AI-driven new data centers set to spring up across the US.A transformer is an essential part of an electrical system as it changes the voltage level of electricity produced by power plants for the efficient transmission of electrical energy. The cost to build each unit ranges from 6 billion to 20 billion won ($14 million).Hyosung HICO is the only US producer of 765-kilovolt (kV) transformers, which cost about 20 billion won per unit.The company has recently bagged an order to manufacture the ultra-high-voltage transformer from one of the top five US utility companies.Hyosung moved much faster than its competitors in making bold investments to develop ultra-high-voltage transformers while others hesitated, said Hyosung HICO president. The company\u2019s transformers are highly sought after by its customers in the US , where it has been supplying them to US utility companies since 1999.Hyosung is expected to win more transformer orders in the US.The US government under President Donald Trump has decided to simultaneously build more liquefied natural gas (LNG), renewable energy and nuclear power plants to cope with mounting electricity demand from data centers powering AI. Transformers are required to run power plants and data centers.Further, over 70% of the US electricity grids are more than 25 years old, meaning that the demand to replace old transformers with new ones is set to increase further in the next decade.Encouraged by the rosy outlook, Hyosung's cross-town rival HD Hyundai Electric Co. also announced a plan earlier this year to invest about half of its 2024 operating profit, estimated at 720 billion won, to bump up its transformer output at its US plant in Alabama to 150 units a year from the current 100. Hyosung is poised to win more transformer orders in the US without worrying about tariffs thanks to its transformer plant in Tennessee.Hyosung acquired the Memphis plant from Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Electric Power Products for $45 million in 2020 to avoid heavy tariffs the first Trump administration threatened to impose on imports.The brave investment has proved to be a stroke of genius.Driven by the increasing price of transformers on their high demand, Hyosung Heavy Industries\u2019 operating profit hit its historic high of 362.5 billion won in 2024, and this year\u2019s profit is forecast to exceed 500 billion won, according to market analysts.Its operating profit in 2020 stood at 44.1 billion won.Backed by the strong demand for transformers, Hyosung plans to transform its Memphis plant into a place where it can produce not only transformers but also other power equipment such as industrial circuit breakers and static synchronous compensators (statcom) to beef up profitability, the company said.Woo-Sub Kim at duter@hankyung.com Sookyung Seo edited this article.",

            "content": "Business journalists, by the end of the 20th century, would be acclaiming Welch\u2019s wisdom at every imaginable opportunity. Indeed, noted one Washington Post columnist in 1999, \u201cyou can hardly open a business magazine nowadays without seeing a salute to Jack Welch. The man\u2019s a bloomin\u2019 genius.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Fortune magazine tagged Welch the corporate \u201cmanager of the century.\u201d Under his leadership, General Electric had become the world\u2019s largest nonbank financial corporation. The value of G.E.\u2019s shares, with Welch in command, had skyrocketed from $14 billion to over $410 billion, a leap that had turned G.E. into the nation\u2019s most valuable publicly traded corporation.\n\nIn the face of such achievement, even crusty CEO-pay critics genuflected.\n\n\u201cJack Welch of General Electric made $75 million last year, and he is a brilliant, brilliant chief executive,\u201d CEO gadfly Graef Crystal told reporters in 2000. \u201cYou could make the case that if anyone deserves to be paid $75 million, it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\nHow could an executive be worth so much? America\u2019s biggest book publishers felt America would pay to find out. In 2000, they staged a spirited bidding war for Welch\u2019s memoirs. The eventual winner, Time Warner, offered Welch a $7.1-million advance, an unprecedented sum for \u201cnonfiction.\u201d\n\nWelch\u2019s book, published in 2001, went on to become a bestseller. But would-be captains of industry didn\u2019t have to read Jack: Straight from the Gut to learn the great man\u2019s secrets. The \u201cbig ideas\u201d behind Welch\u2019s phenomenal success had already begun sweeping through America\u2019s corporate suites.\n\nAmong Welch\u2019s most admired contributions to corporate wisdom: his competitiveness dictum. If you\u2019re not competitive in a particular market, Welch advised, don\u2019t compete.\n\nAnd Welch practiced what he preached. Early on in his tenure as G.E. chief exec, he directed his managers to \u201csell off any division whose product was not among the top three in its U.S. market.\u201d They did. G.E. would unload or shut down operations in moves that cost over 100,000 workers their jobs.\n\nWelch played few favorites. He could be as ruthless with his white-collar help as his blue-collar factory workers. His most brutal office personnel practice \u2014 the annual firing squad known as \u201cforced rankings\u201d \u2014 had G.E. managers ranking their professional employees, every year, in one of three categories: top 20 percent, middle 70, or bottom 10. The top got accolades. The bottom got fired.\n\n\u201cNot removing that bottom 10 percent,\u201d Welch would tell G.E. shareholders, \u201cis not only a management failure but false kindness as well.\u201d\n\nJack Welch\u2019s General Electric would have no room for \u201cfalse kindness.\u201d You were either competitively successful, as an employee or a division, or out. You had to deliver.\n\nExcept at the top. Jack Welch delivered nothing. He became the 20th century\u2019s most celebrated corporate exec by identifying challenges \u2014 and running the other way. A G.E. division struggling to make a market impact? Dump it. An employee not putting up the numbers? Fire away.\n\nJack Welch did not turn marginal business operations into market leaders. He did not endeavor to transform weak staffers into standouts. He surrounded himself instead with the already successful \u2014 already successful divisions, already successful employees \u2014 and rode their successes to his own personal glory.\n\nWelch, to be sure, did sometimes try to develop something new. In the late 1990s, he decided that G.E. needed to stake out a cyberspace claim. General Electric, Welch told USA Today, has \u201cgot to have more \u2018dot.coms.\u2019\u201d He proceeded to pour cascades of cash into iVillage and a host of now-forgotten sites that promptly, within a matter of months, lost 90 percent of their value.\n\nWelch\u2019s own personal value, meanwhile, just kept rising.\n\n\u201cIs my salary too high?\u201d Welch asked in 1999, his year he pocketed $75 million, the equivalent of over $140 million today. \u201cSomebody else will have to decide that, but this is a competitive marketplace.\u201d\n\nTranslation: \u201cI deserve every penny. The market says so.\u201d\n\nTo advance Welch\u2019s quest for that every penny, his minions cut corners at every opportunity. His aircraft engine division defrauded the Pentagon and bribed an Israeli general to gain jet engine orders. His factories poisoned the Hudson River, and his lawyers argued G.E. had no responsibility to clean the river up. General Electric, Welch preached, had a responsibility only to its shareholders.\n\n\u201cCorporate raiders like T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn may have been the first to call for companies to \u2018maximize shareholder value,\u2019 but they were outsiders, knocking on corporate America\u2019s door,\u201d as Bloomberg columnist Joe Nocera has noted. \u201cWelch was the ultimate insider, and when he started to emphasize shareholder value, so did the entire American business culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany other corporate leaders,\u201d the New Yorker\u2019s John Cassidy would add right after Welch\u2019s death in 2020, \u201cfollowed the example that he set. Together they created a more intensive form of American capitalism, one which greatly enriched owners of capital \u2014 themselves most definitely included.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump would famously count himself among those Welch helped enrich.\n\n\u201cWe made wonderful deals together,\u201d Trump tweeted after Welch\u2019s passing. \u201cHe will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nWrong. The March 1 fifth anniversary of Welch\u2019s passing has just come and gone virtually unnoticed, a clear signal that this corporate titan\u2019s enormous celebrity status has faded away. So has the company Welch domineered. By 2018, G.E. had fallen out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the bluest corporate blue-chip index. By last April, as CNN reported, the \u201conce mighty industrial icon\u201d had split into a variety of smaller pieces.\n\nBut Welch\u2019s enrich-the-already-rich mindset, on the other hand, lives on as powerfully as ever. Donald Trump now rules from the White House, with the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, at his side. Musk made his fortune managing people and enterprises with an imperial bearing that fully befits the brutality of Welch and his \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d job-killing persona.\n\n\u2018Folks,\u201d the Missouri antitrust advocate Lucas Kunce reflected last month, \u201cElon Musk isn\u2019t running America, Jack Welch is running it from his grave.\u201d\n\nSam Pizzigati, an Institute for Policy Studies associate fellow, co-edits Inequality.org.

The company is an icon on Wall Street today, but in a little over a year the situation is likely to be vastly different. Here's what you need to know if you're looking at Honeywell right now.\n\nWhat is Honeywell?\n\nAlthough correctly classified as an industrial company, Honeywell is really best thought of as an industrial conglomerate. That basically means the company operates in a number of different businesses, each with its own nuances. This isn't an uncommon practice, but there's a pendulum on Wall Street. Sometimes investors want to see companies grow larger through acquisitions, effectively creating conglomerates. And at other times investors want companies to slim down and specialize, which for existing conglomerates means breaking themselves apart.\n\nWall Street has recently been leaning toward the preference of breaking conglomerates up. Industrial peer General Electric recently completed the process, separating out into three different businesses: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, and GE Healthcare Technologies. And now Honeywell appears to be ready to do the same, announcing its breakup plans in early February.\n\nHoneywell had previously announced plans to spin off its advanced material business. But it updated the plan to include the separation of its aerospace operations and its automation business. So, like General Electric, Honeywell as it exists today will cease to exist and it will, instead, be three different companies. The goal is to complete the breakup sometime in the second half of 2026, a bit more than a year from now.\n\nWhat will investors own?\n\nSo the question for investors who own Honeywell today, or who buy it between now and the time of the breakup, is: What will they own after all of the technicalities are taken care of?\n\nFor starters, the process of breaking a giant company up isn't easy. So the technicalities are a big deal, and they need to be monitored. For example: Who's going to be on the different boards? Who will end leading the new companies? What will each company's balance sheet look like?\n\nSometimes breakups don't end up happening as planned. They can take longer than expected, and the companies that come out the other side aren't treated equally well in the breakup. That said, when it all shakes out, shareholders of Honeywell as it exists today will end up owning three different companies.\n\nHoneywell Automation will own the company's portfolio of productivity-enhancing technologies, solutions, and software. The group had revenue of $18 billion in 2024, so it's a sizable business. Automation is likely to be an important drive for companies in the future as they look to contain costs and increase profits.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace will provide technology and solutions to the commercial travel and defense industries. According to Honeywell, it has its fingers in \"virtually every\" aerospace platform around the world thanks to its propulsion, cockpit, navigation, and power systems. This business generated $15 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nAdvanced Materials is the smallest spinoff, with \"just\" $4 billion in revenue in 2024. It produces specialty chemicals and materials, with leading positions in \"fluorine products, electronic materials, industrial grade fibers, and healthcare packaging solutions.\"\n\nThe big goal of the Honeywell breakup\n\nIt's too soon to know how all of this corporate activity is going to play out, or whether any of the companies that come out the other side will thrive. But there's a general theme to consider. As a conglomerate, each of Honeywell's divisions has to compete for capital and management attention. That can cause lagging businesses to be forgotten and ones that are doing well to deal with unnecessary distractions. Thus, the big plan here is to allow each of the new companies that are created to focus all of their attention on their core businesses. That's a reasonable goal, but sometimes that doesn't actually lead to good business performance.\n\nSo in about a year or so, Honeywell as it is known today will be no more. In its place will be three new companies, each with a more focused business model. That really makes Honeywell a special situation stock, which probably won't interest most investors. That's not to suggest that management is making a mistake, only that the outcome of such a massive overhaul is incredibly hard to predict.",

            "content": "Few cars can boast a legacy like that of the Chevrolet Camaro. It has lived for almost 65 years as one of the most iconic vehicles in the American industry, but 2024 has been very tough and will forever be marked as its last year of production. General Motors has decided to discontinue this muscle car that has given us so much, and that leads to a series of layoffs that will affect more than three hundred employees at the Michigan plant (Lansing Grand River)\n\nOf course, it has not been good news for anyone, 369 workers will lose their jobs due to this restructuring that GM is carrying out. We tell you what is happening in the General Motors offices to have made this decision below.\n\nLansing Grand River Plant.\n\nLocated in the industrial heart of Michigan, the Lansing Grand River plant has played a key role in manufacturing models like the Cadillac CT4, CT5, and Camaro. However, with GM\u2019s decision to end Camaro production, the plant has become the centre of attention within the company, putting the job stability of its workers at risk.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t just about the automotive giant, behind every worker, there is a family, and behind every family, a local economy that must continue fighting to overcome daily challenges.\n\nLansing Mayor Andy Schor has expressed deep concern over the situation, hoping that GM will reassign new projects to the plant to prevent further job cuts. \u201cIt is crucial to ensure job continuity in our region\u2019s automotive industry,\u201d Schor stated.\n\nWhy did General Motors make this decision?\n\nLooking at market trends, it\u2019s not hard to see why GM is restructuring, the company is making a major push toward electrification. The American giant has officially announced its goal of becoming a 100% electric vehicle manufacturer by 2035, which is the main reason behind the workforce reductions at its production plants.\n\nTransitioning to an all-electric lineup means adjusting production strategies and redirecting resources to plants that will build next-generation vehicles.\n\nFarewell to the Camaro\n\nEven for GM executives, this was not an easy decision. The company has expressed gratitude to Camaro fans for their support over the years.\n\nA new hope for Lansing\u2019s economy\n\nFollowing GM\u2019s electrification strategy, the company has invested $2.6 billion in partnership with LG Energy Solution Michigan Inc. to build an Ultium battery plant in Lansing.\n\nThis project could bring a much-needed boost to the region if the plant successfully attracts electric vehicle production, it could create new job opportunities for affected workers and help sustain the local economy\n\nHow have workers taken this decision?\n\nOf course, for workers, uncertainty and grief have been the predominant sentiment in recent months. While it is true that investment in electrification could generate new employment opportunities, there is still no guarantee that the employees who are going to be laid off will be able to return to this new project that is going to be carried out.\n\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) union has expressed its dissatisfaction with the cuts and is looking for solutions to protect its members. Representatives of the union urged GM to offer fair compensation and relocation options to other plants.\n\nOther assembly plants also in danger\n\nThat\u2019s right, Lansing won\u2019t be the only plant to see cuts; the Orion Township plant has also proposed laying off a total of 945 workers as of January 1.\n\nTechnology brings change, and this is just a reflection of the fact that not everything will always stay the same. Of course, laying off the Camaro isn\u2019t easy, but neither is it for those 1,300 people who will lose their jobs due to the changes in the market. Let\u2019s hope that GM can find a solution soon so that they can return to the front line of the battle.",

According to GM, it is identifying ideal locations for EV charging stations through AI and machine learning.\n\nThanks to AI tools, GM can strategically pinpoint locations for new EV charging stations. Using predictive analytics and geospatial algorithms, AI tools can analyze traffic patterns to highlight the most convenient charging location in an area for EV drivers.\n\nWhile EV sales have increased \u2014 and broken records \u2014 new charging stations still need to be installed to keep up with the growing demand. In 2024, for example, GM's EV sales hit an all-time high.\n\nHowever, now the challenge is increasing the number of EV charging stations spread across the U.S. By collaborating with EVgo, one of the largest EV charging public networks, GM is planning on building 2,850 DC public charging stalls. What's more, 400 of those stations will be fast-charging stalls at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas.\n\nGM said the stations will feature high-power 350-kilowatt fast chargers as well as pull-through layouts for optimal maneuvering. Many of the charging stations will also have all-weather canopies and bright lighting for added safety and convenience for EV drivers.\n\nTo help families with road trips and long-distance traveling, GM has partnered with Pilot Travel and EVgo to add up to 2,000 DC fast-charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J travel centers spread across the country. Already, more than 130 of these locations are open to the public, per GM.\n\nBy installing more EV charging stations, companies can encourage the widespread adoption of EVs. Switching to an electric vehicle is beneficial for your wallet and the environment. Compared to gas-powered vehicles, EVs are quieter and emit no tailpipe pollution.\n\nEV drivers can expect to save $1,500 a year on gas and maintenance; some EV models still qualify for a $7,500 tax credit.\n\n\"Thanks to AI and machine learning, GM is addressing the critical need for more EV charging stations in strategic locations across the U.S., helping to make EV ownership possible for more drivers than ever before,\" according to the company.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

The original 1930 plans from St. Louis consultant Harland Bartholomew collected dust for 27 years before they were picked up and revised.\n\nThen in 1960, Louisville officials agreed to have the Reynolds Metals Company and General Electric buy and develop a riverfront park, but the relationship between the businesses and the city would soon grow tense. Reynolds felt they had to wait too long to get the project started, while city leaders were skeptical of the \"elaborate and expensive\" designs drawn up by Greek architect Constantinos Doxiadis, The Courier Journal reported. Reynolds and GE pulled out of the project in 1967.\n\nMeanwhile, the portion of Interstate 64 running past downtown Louisville, known as the Riverside Expressway, was ready for construction. A local planning group wanted to split the expressway and develop the proposed riverside park in between, but the Kentucky Highway Department disagreed. The idea, first introduced in 1964, was abandoned a year later. The Belvedere plaza would eventually be built on top of the highway.\n\nMore: Retro Louisville | Louisville Downs closes in 1991 following decades of harness racing\n\nMayor William O. Cowger appointed Archibald P. Cochran, a retired industrialist, as \"expediter\" of the riverside park project in 1964. Cochran died before the Belvedere opened to the public, but he was credited by officials for leading the turnaround of what was a floundering project before he came in. Cochran led the Riverside Commission, a seven-member board \"created to get the project moving,\" the Courier Journal noted in a 1973 article.\n\nWork to develop the Belvedere did finally get moving in 1969. Doxiadis, who was retained by the Riverside Commission as the project's lead architect, released a final design for a plaza, parking garage and wharf, all of which would cost about $13.5 million to put up. The city started taking in construction bids in July 1969. Ground was broken on the garage five months later.\n\nIn October 1971, Barmore Construction was awarded a $2.3 million contract to build the Belvedere plaza. When the area opened to the public 18 months later, Mayor Frank W. Burke considered it to be one of the best riverfront developments in the country.\n\n\"It marks the rebirth of Louisville. It's a return of the city to its source,\" he said in April 1973.\n\nMore: Retro Louisville | Jackie Robinson visits Kentucky as baseball player, social justice advocate\n\nOn the day of the Belvedere's dedication, hundreds of students from Louisville schools released balloons into the sky and watched as fountainheads sprayed water in a dazzling display. A Courier Journal story from April 28, 1973 called the ceremony a \"glorious moment for Louisville\" and a \"realization of a dream of some 40 years ago.\"\n\nDuring a speech, Burke looked around the student audience, then told them who the Belvedere is meant for.\n\n\"Over there you see a mother and her children. And the sound of children playing. This is significant because the plaza is dedicated to them,\" he said.\n\nMore: Greenberg unveils Belvedere renderings at 2025 State of the City address\n\nReach reporter Leo Bertucci at lbertucci@gannett.com or @leober2chee on X, formerly known as Twitter",

            "content": "Report suggested GSA may pull the plug on thousands of EVs and chargers\n\nGSA provides vehicles to federal agencies; 20% of 2024 light-vehicle orders were EVs\n\nCould affect chargers at national parks, VA hospitals, other venues\n\nThe U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which manages all federal government buildings and has been nicknamed by some as the largest landlord in the world, might be planning to shut down its EV chargers and offload some or all of its EVs, according to a report last week by The Verge, citing a GSA email and a source familiar with the plans.\n\nThe move, if true, would take about 8,000 charging connectors and thousands of EVs out of service.\n\nHowever GSA on Friday provided a response to Green Car Reports that leaves some questions about the authenticity or intent of the email seen by several news sources.\n\n\"On January 24, 2025, the GSA Acting Administrator and Deputy Administrator issued a memorandum directing the temporary suspension of all new GSA obligations, including new awards, task and delivery orders, and modifications and options, with limited exceptions,\" said Will Powell, acting GSA press secretary.\n\nPowell's response continued: \"This temporary suspension includes federal fleet orders of zero emission vehicles. GSA is also working with our agency partners to confirm installed Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), or EVSE related projects still in planning/execution phases, are mission critical in nature and in support of fleet EVs. At this time, no action has been taken regarding EVSE at federal buildings across the country.\"\n\nWhat follows is the original piece, analyzing the impact of those reports assuming their alleged context and legitimacy.\n\n--\n\nIf true, it might amount to an exceptionally strange juxtaposition for Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO has spent years admirably facing down Tesla short-sellers on the viability of EVs and selling the public on how EVs cost less to own and use over the long run\u2014even claiming, perhaps optimistically, at various points that Tesla's EVs would be appreciating assets. Musk is now managing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which according to the Trump administration seeks \"to modernize federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\"\n\nIf running an EV and keeping electricity flowing to its Level 2 charger isn't the technology that maximizes cost savings for the fleet over the long run, as Musk has argued for years, the Tesla CEO might need to update some of its core selling points for EVs\u2014or have a conversation with shareholders.\n\nThe news of the charger shutdown and EV purge was first reported by Colorado Public Radio on Thursday, which reported that chargers at the Denver Federal Center were due to be shut down. The Verge then reported Friday that it had obtained the GSA email telling federal workers to begin the process of shutting down all EV chargers overseen by the agency, which is reportedly due to be formally announced internally next week.\n\nVolkswagen, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and UT Knoxville test wireless charging\n\nThe GSA currently operates or hosts various Level 2 AC chargers across the country, totaling about 8,000 connectors. They're mostly there to charge government-owned EVs, but they also charge personal vehicles of federal employees, according to The Verge. Examples of charger locations seen by Green Car Reports as under GSA control that might affect public accessibility might include publicly accessible locations at national parks and VA hospitals.\n\nHighway fast-charging infrastructure already frozen\n\nIf true, it will be the second significant impact by the Trump administration on EV chargers that were essentially already paid for. It froze EV charger funding earlier this month, pending new rules not yet released, something automakers have already rallied against. California plans to move ahead with its own EV charger buildout despite the funding freeze; it's also promised to offer purchase incentives for most EVs (likely not including Teslas), equivalent to the current federal tax credit, should the administration eliminate that.\n\n\u201cAs GSA has worked to align with the current administration, we have received direction that all GSA owned charging stations are not mission critical,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThere's nothing to directly indicate that the decision to shut down chargers comes from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But the term \"not mission critical\" echoes language often used by Musk, who has been arbitrarily cutting federal spending and jobs in his role as an advisor to the Trump Administration. And, if this is overseen by Musk, it directly conflicts with the CEO's longtime efforts suggesting that Teslas would make good public-service vehicles with lower operating costs.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk suggesting Tesla EVs cost less for patrols\n\nSome regional federal offices had already been instructed to take their chargers offline, according to The Verge, which adds that the GSA is looking to cancel current network contracts that keep chargers operational. Once those contracts are canceled, chargers will be \u201cturned off at the breaker,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThe federal fleet currently includes approximately 650,000 vehicles, more than half of which were due to be replaced with EVs under a Biden administration plan. Of that total, GSA currently provides a fleet of about 230,000. Although a fleet summary hub page has been removed, a November 2024 release from the GSA notes that it's ordered a cumulative 82,000 EVs and installed more than 10,500 individual charging ports, with an additional 52,535 charge ports in progress. It also reported that EVs made up 20% of its light-duty vehicle orders in 2024.\n\n2022 Ford F-150 Lightning\n\nThe now-disputed report, citing the same source with knowledge of the plan, noted that GSA-controlled facilities will stop using EVs and start offloading them, although it didn't make clear whether they were to be sold or stored.\n\nOf course, chargers at facilities are essential for keeping government EVs in service. \"You can't have an electric vehicle if you can't plug it in,\" said Mark Dowd, who was the Biden administration's director of zero emission vehicles and on the White House Council on Environmental Quality, in a 2023 podcast from the administration.\n\nIndependent of any vehicle spending, the previous administration also allocated $975 million to the GSA to upgrade federal buildings with \"emerging and sustainable technologies\"\u2014including EV charging\u2014so it's unclear how much of that outlay it would be abandoning in doing so.\n\nUSPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDV) - Oshkosh Defense\n\nFraught USPS EV order in question, again?\n\nGSA has worked alongside the U.S. Postal Service to support and modernize its fleet with more electric vehicles.\n\nThat may beg the question of whether the United States Postal Service (USPS) will take delivery of as many EVs as anticipated, after a debacle that led to a plan to purchase mainly gasoline vehicles. The federal government currently has tens of thousands of EVs in use, and it planned to replace more than half of its approximately 650,000 vehicles with EVs.\n\nGSA either helps buy vehicles for agencies or leases them to agencies, depending on the situation. Under a Biden executive order, GSA was transitioning to all-electric vehicle purchases by 2027. GSA replaces a small percentage of its vehicles annually; vehicles haven't been pre-emptively replaced with EVs, rather as gasoline models reach the end of their service life. Examples include a push to switch National Park Service vehicles from gasoline F-150 trucks to Ford F-150 Lightning models on an ongoing basis.\n\nGSA keeps vehicles in use a long time, according to federal data, and in many cases well into high mileage, which seems like an ideal use case for EVs. According to its own current standards, the minimum life cycle for replacement of electric trucks, for instance, is seven years or 90,000 miles. Many vehicles in the GSA fleet are much older.\n\nTesla website promoting savings over gasoline vehicles - Feb. 2025\n\nMusk has spent much bandwidth on EVs as smart money\n\nAs Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly emphasized over a span of more than a decade, and as Tesla's very own site has aggressively pushed this as a built-in part of its pricing, EVs cost less to run\u2014not just to fuel, but to own and maintain. According to Tesla the Model 3, for instance, has a five-year gas savings of $5,000 based on 10,000 miles a year or $7,500 based on 15,000 miles a year (with Los Angeles as the location). Longer maintenance intervals on EVs, including items like brake pads and fluids, mean preventative maintenance costs are far lower.\n\nIf Musk is at all behind this, it leads to a bigger question: If the chief cost-cutter and efficiency master doesn't actually believe that EVs are cheaper and more efficient for the government to be running daily\u2014or can't convince President Trump that they are\u2014will Tesla continue to sell its own vehicles on that premise?\n\n\n\n--with reporting by Stephen Edelstein and Bengt Halvorson.\n\n\n\nGreen Car Reports reached out to the GSA and will update this as elements are either officially confirmed or refuted.\n\nUPDATE 1/24/2025: An earlier version of this report didn't make clear that the GSA-provided fleet is about 230,000 of the approximately 650,000-vehicle federal total. Also, the USPS is not GSA-managed.\n\nUPDATE 1/28/2025: Incorporated official GSA response. Remainder of original piece left intact for context and the original analysis as a response to what was reported.\n\n\n\n",

H John Voorhees III / H John Voorhees III\n\nDuracell has decided to move its research-and-development headquarters out of Connecticut from Bethel to Atlanta, Georgia. It is a decision that is being scrutinized not only in the northern Fairfield County town, but also across the state.\n\nThe battery maker is the latest of several prominent companies in recent years to decide to move a hub in Connecticut to another state. Each of those relocations has stoked worries among elected officials and business leaders that pressures such as the cost of doing business and worker shortages have made the state inhospitable to businesses. But a number of relocations to Connecticut during the same time frame have shown that the state can still be an attractive location for many large companies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWhenever an event like this happens, it\u2019s a reminder that we have to ask why the company is leaving,\u201d Chris DiPentima, CEO and president of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said this week. \u201cIt usually comes down to cost or workforce.\u201d\n\nConspicuous departures\n\nDuracell has not made anyone available for an interview with CT Insider since the decision to relocate the R&D headquarters was announced last week. But a company spokesperson shared a written statement this week that summarized the reasons for the move out of Bethel, where it has had a presence since the mid-1970s.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cOur decision to move was driven by the desire for better proximity to our manufacturing sites, along with the appeal of the universities in the Atlanta/Georgia area, which made the location ideal for local recruitment,\u201d the statement said. The company\u2019s operations in Georgia include a distribution center in the Atlanta suburb of Fairburn and a manufacturing facility in the city of LaGrange, near the Georgia-Alabama line.\n\nLego's main U.S. offices are located in this building on Print Shop Road in Enfield, Conn.

Jim Michaud/Journal Inquirer\n\nState legislators\u2019 reaction to Duracell\u2019s announcement was mixed. The three Republican lawmakers who represent Bethel in the state General Assembly \u2014 Sens. Eric Berthel and Tony Hwang, and Rep. Martin Foncello \u2014 asserted that the relocation was driven by the high costs of doing business in Connecticut. They expressed particular concern about electricity costs and property taxes.\n\n\u201cAny private enterprise looking to make money must surely consider its bottom-line costs. This is a company that has invested tens of millions of dollars in our region and our residents for half a century, and I\u2019m sure it did not take this decision lightly,\u201d Berthel said in a written statement. \u201cThis is yet another red flag regarding Connecticut\u2019s business climate. I encourage the majority to join all legislative Republicans in taking steps to reverse this troubling course.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Campbell's Co., closed at the end of 2024 its offices in this building at 595 Westport Ave., in Norwalk, Conn., which was a hub for the company's snacks business, which includes Pepperidge Farm.

Raghib Allie-Brennan, the sole Democratic member of Bethel\u2019s delegation in the state legislature, disagreed with his Republican counterparts. He said in his own statement that, \u201cthis was not a rejection of Connecticut\u2019s policies but rather an internal business decision.\u201d\n\nAllie-Brennan added in his statement that Duracell had qualified for a property tax break of $870,000 from the Georgia state government related to the relocation of the R&D HQ. In its statement, Duracell indicated that it has received state funding in Georgia, but it did not disclose the amount.\n\n\u201cWhile Duracell is grateful for the incentives that Georgia has provided since we established our manufacturing sites in the state, the local tax incentives were not a deciding factor in our move to Atlanta,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFrontier Communications announced in 2023 that it would move its headquarters from this building at 401 Merritt 7 in Norwalk, Conn., to Dallas, Texas.

An attorney for Duracell told town officials in March 2023 that the company had about 100 to 150 employees based at its hub at 14 Research Drive, which is part of Berkshire Corporate Park.\n\nBased on recent conversations with Duracell officials, town leaders in Bethel are hopeful that a number of employees who work remotely will stay in Connecticut after the R&D move is completed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThey reassured us that a lot of people are here and staying here,\u201d Bethel First Selectman Dan Carter said last week.\n\nGeneral Electric was headquartered at this property on Easton Turnpike in Fairfield, Conn., before relocating the headquarters to Boston in 2016.

The conglomerate\u2019s move ended a stay of more than 40 years in Fairfield.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts spends more on research and development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world,\u201d Jeff Immelt, GE's then-CEO, said in January 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn September 2021, financial-technology firm iCapital opened these offices in the Greenwich Plaza complex in downtown Greenwich, Conn. Christian Abraham / Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nThe uprooting of the headquarters tarnished Connecticut\u2019s economic reputation because GE was the largest company headquartered in the state. It ranked No. 11 in the 2016 edition of the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations.\n\nBut the jobs loss from the move was limited. GE laid off about 100 employees and transferred about 200 employees to Boston, compared with an in-state head count of about 5,700 when it announced the relocation.\n\nGE operations that stayed in Connecticut included remnants of its GE Capital business. The year before, GE completed the spinoff of GE Capital's North American retail finance business into its own publicly traded company, the Stamford-based Synchrony.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe remainder of GE has been split into three new publicly traded companies in the past couple of years. One of those firms, GE Aerospace, has offices at The Towers complex in Norwalk, where GE Capital was based.\n\nSoon after GE\u2019s move, Connecticut faced the prospect of losing another Fortune 500 firm, Aetna. The health insurer, which was acquired in 2018 by an even larger Fortune 500 company, CVS Health, had explored relocating its headquarters from Hartford to Manhattan, but it ended up staying put.\n\nShortly before CVS completed its acquisition of Aetna, the latter committed to keeping its main offices in Connecticut for another 10 years. But CVS/Aetna\u2019s future in the state\u2019s capital city has been clouded by more than 1,200 layoffs affecting positions connected to the Hartford offices that have been carried out or announced in the past year and a half.\n\nLoading...\n\nNotable arrivals\n\nWhile Connecticut has grappled with some significant corporate departures in the recent years, it has also attracted a number of large companies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring Ned Lamont\u2019s six years as governor, the biggest corporate recruit has been tobacco producer Philip Morris International, which opened in late 2022 its main offices in Stamford, after relocating from Manhattan.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Fortune 500 included PMI and 14 other Connecticut-headquartered companies. The Connecticut-based companies\u2019 3% share of last year\u2019s Fortune 500 firms exceeds the state\u2019s approximately 1% portion of the U.S. population.\n\nIn 2021, the year that PMI announced it would move to Connecticut, Lamont\u2019s administration announced several other corporate moves. They included the relocation of manufacturing-and-technology company ITT\u2019s headquarters from White Plains, New York to Stamford; the move of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group\u2019s headquarters from Manhattan to Stamford; and financial-technology firm iCapital\u2019s expansion to the state, with an office opening in Greenwich.\n\nIn the past few years, the state has attracted several other fintech firms.

The company relocated its headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri to another building in Stamford in 2012. Tyler Sizemore/Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nAmid the corporate comings and goings of the past decade, Connecticut has struggled with jobs growth. At the end of last year, the state still had fewer payroll jobs than it did at its all-time peak in March 2008. That predicament reflects headwinds, such as low population growth since the Great Recession and post-pandemic worker shortages.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSome leaders in the business community, such as the CBIA\u2019s DiPentima, take solace in the stabilization of the state government\u2019s finances in the past few years.

            "content": "Follow us today...\n\nThe Chevy Silverado EV has sparked significant interest in the electric vehicle world, offering a blend of utility, innovation, and range. But beyond the marketing materials and spec sheets, what do real owners and enthusiasts think about this truck? By diving into Reddit discussions and exploring real world use, we uncover both the highlights and challenges of owning and driving Chevy\u2019s electric pickup.\n\nThe Silverado EV\u2019s Strengths: Range, Features, and Utility\n\nOne of the Silverado EV\u2019s standout features is its impressive range. The RST First Edition boasts an estimated 400 miles on a full charge, making it one of the longest-range electric trucks on the market. The Original Poster of a Reddit thread noted:\n\nIt has an epic 213.7 kWh (gross) battery. In car and driver, real-world 75-mph testing, the Silverado EV was bested only by the Lucid Air (410 miles), and equaled by the EQS at 400 miles. If you want a long-range EV with a lot of cargo space, this is the one to pick.\n\nThis sentiment aligns with Torque News\u2019 article \u201cAn Unexpected Journey in Electric Trucking,\u201d which highlighted how reliable the Silverado EV\u2019s range estimates were during a six-day adventure. Even under heavy loads, the truck delivered consistent performance.\n\nInterior Impressions: Mixed Reactions\n\nWhile many appreciate the Silverado EV\u2019s range and utility, opinions on its interior design are more divided. One commenter noted:\n\n\"Truck is impressive; interior is gorgeous. Just can't get over that ugly front end. I know it's for aerodynamics but I think it would sell a lot better if it had similar styling to the 1500 like the Lightning did.\"\n\nAnother commenter shared frustration over compatibility issues with older models:\n\n\"Makes me mad those are 8 lugs; can\u2019t quite fit those on my 2000 Silverado 1500 without adapters.\"\n\nTorque News\u2019 article \u201c2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV Offers More Trim and Range Options\u201d noted that Chevy is addressing some concerns by offering mid-range trims like the LT model, which balances affordability with improved interior quality.\n\nCharging Challenges: A Common Pain Point\n\nCharging remains a challenge for many EV owners, and Silverado EV drivers are no exception. One commenter shared their frustration with Hertz\u2019s rental policy for EVs:\n\n\"Hertz's policy for returning an EV to them was/maybe still is that you have to fill it just like you do with ICE. I'd be happy to rent an EV on a work trip, but not if I have a 7am return flight and need to get to a charger in the vicinity of the rental return at 4:30am.\"\n\nAnother commenter from r/F150Lightning described issues with DC fast chargers failing to recognize their truck or abruptly ending charging sessions. They eventually succeeded at an Electrify America station but noted quirks like loud horn blasts when shutting the door while plugged in.\n\nTorque News\u2019 article \u201cI Traded My Rivian R1T for a Chevy Silverado LT EV\u201d acknowledged these growing pains but emphasized that Chevy\u2019s (formerly known as Ultium) platform provides a solid foundation for improving charging reliability over time.\n\nUtility and Practicality: A True Workhorse\n\nFor those who prioritize towing capacity and cargo space, the Silverado EV shines. One commenter summed it up well: \"I am not the target audience, but I think if you want an EV and want to tow a bunch of [stuff], Silverado EV is the car you want. If you\u2019re not in that category though, yeah\u2014no reason I can see to pick it over other options.\"\n\nTorque News also highlighted this strength in their article \u201cAn Unexpected Journey in Electric Trucking\u201d noting how effectively the truck handled heavy payloads while maintaining stability and comfort.\n\nAesthetic Appeal: Divisive Opinions\n\nThe design of the Silverado EV has sparked debate among enthusiasts. While some love its bold look, others find it polarizing. One commenter humorously described it as:\n\n\"It\u2019s like an Avalanche and a Silverado had a baby that was fed a ton of McDonald\u2019s and Arby\u2019s and didn\u2019t ever go outside to play or exercise.\"\n\nIn contrast, another commenter praised its modern aesthetic:\n\n\"I personally love the aesthetic. It\u2019s the primary reason I waited for the Silverado instead of buying the F-150 Lightning.\"\n\nConclusion: A Promising Start with Room for Growth\n\nThe Chevy Silverado EV represents an exciting step forward in electric trucking. Its range, utility, and innovative features make it a strong contender in its segment. However, as real-world testimonials show, there are still areas for improvement\u2014particularly in charging infrastructure compatibility and interior refinement.\n\nBy addressing these challenges head-on while continuing to innovate, Chevy has positioned itself as a key player in shaping the future of electric trucks. For now, vehicles like the Silverado EV demonstrate that sustainable transportation can be practical without sacrificing performance.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Chevrolet Newsroom\n\nMikey Garcia has been passionate about cars and alternative fuels long before they were mainstream, from closely following the GM EV1 to running biodiesel in his Volkswagen Beetle TDI and Mercedes 300SD.

            "content": "Industry experts said political and EV market headwinds will make 2025 an acid test for whether GM can sustain its momentum and hit a tipping point in its long and expensive history of electrification efforts. One pivotal moment will come later this year as GM launches the next-generation Bolt, expected to be its most affordable EV at about $30,000.\n\nSuch cheap EV leases, common industry-wide, were made possible largely by a $7,500 subsidy that U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to end along with a host of other pro-EV policies. GM would also be vulnerable to Trump's threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico because it makes hundreds of thousands of cars in Mexico - including the Blazer and Equinox EVs.\n\nAggressive pricing also played a role in the form of low-payment leases that often made GM EVs cheaper than its comparable fuel-powered vehicles, according to industry analysts and two GM dealers.\n\n\"We've got the broadest lineup out there, and we definitely have momentum,\" he said. \"And we all know that the automotive industry is a momentum game.\"\n\nGM global markets chief Rory Harvey cited the same reason in an interview with Reuters.\n\nAnalysts credited GM's EV surge to its growing number of competitive models - from entry-level to premium - giving its customers more electric options than rivals. Tesla, for example, has five models and only two volume sellers.\n\nThe growth underscores GM's stubborn commitment to EVs, despite heavy losses and a trend among rivals including Ford and Toyota to prioritize gas-electric hybrids.\n\nSales of GM's Cadillac Lyriq EV tripled last year to 28,402, outpacing each of its XT4, XT5 and XT6 gasoline SUVs. Sales of its lower-priced Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer EVs accounted for 22% and 40% respectively of total fourth-quarter deliveries under the same model name.\n\nGM's fourth-quarter share of U.S. EVs hit 12% - double a year earlier and second only to Tesla at 44.4%, according to auto services specialist Cox Automotive.\n\nThe progress - driven by an expanding EV lineup that will soon include a dozen models - signals that GM could for the first time convince more mainstream buyers to go electric, four industry analysts said.\n\nLast year, the U.S. auto-sales leader boosted electric vehicle sales and seized market share from the likes of Tesla ( TSLA ) despite slowing demand as its customers increasingly chose EVs over comparable GM gas-powered models.\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM ) has spent billions over decades trying to blaze an electric trail, releasing pioneering EVs and hybrids that ultimately failed to achieve mass-market sales before being scrapped. This time might be different.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"This year is critical for them,\" said Paul Waatti, industry analysis director at research firm AutoPacific.\n\nGM has historically been first out the gate with innovative electrified cars only to stumble in launches dating back to its 1997 EV1, a futuristic pill-shaped two-door. GM also introduced the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid, the 2011 Volt, and followed up with the all-electric 2017 Bolt, the only relatively affordable EV at the time. All were discontinued without achieving volume sales.\n\nDespite its recent progress, GM still faces immense challenges in delivering on CEO Mary Barra's past pledge of an all-electric fleet by 2035. EVs only comprised about 6% of GM's overall fourth-quarter sales, which continue to rely on large trucks and SUVs that are among the hardest vehicles to electrify, industry experts say.\n\nProgress toward profit\n\nInstead of just one Volt or Bolt, GM now offers 10 models, from the affordable Equinox crossover to six-figure SUVs. Cadillac just launched its Optiq compact electric SUV, which will be followed soon by a three-row Vistiq and lower-priced electric pickups.\n\nGM says it's also getting closer to making EV profits. CFO Paul Jacobson has said GM plans to narrow EV losses by about $2 billion in 2025, without disclosing total annual losses. That estimate, however, depends on continued EV sales growth, which could prove hard if Trump guts EV purchase and lease subsidies.\n\nLosing the $7,500 incentive could tank EV sales unless automakers cut prices, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for automotive research firm Edmunds.\n\n\"We know what happens if you don't provide it,\" he said of EV subsidies and discounts. \"You don't sell.\"\n\nGM said it had not decided whether to lower prices if the subsidies end and that it would wait to assess consumer and competitor reactions. GM nonetheless takes a \"very long-term view\" of its EV commitment, said spokesman Jim Cain.\n\nA $7,500 EV lease incentive has been key to low-payment deals to persuade skeptical EV shoppers. More than 70% of EVs were leased last year at dealerships, including 55% of GM's electric vehicles, Edmunds data shows.\n\n\"It's really the lease offer that makes the big difference,\" said Jeff Laethem, at Detroit's Ray Laethem Motor Village, which includes a Buick and GMC store. For some premium models, it's a $700 monthly payment for a $100,000 vehicle, he said.\n\nEVs over hybrids\n\nGM continues to bet big on EVs at a time when rivals such as Ford and Toyota have focused more on hybrids - a decision that has paid off for them as consumers turn to hybrids in droves to avoid the cost and charging hassles of EVs.\n\nToyota has long dominated the hybrid market and sells few EVs, arguing that EV technology isn't yet advanced or affordable enough for most customers. Hybrids represented more than 40% of Toyota's 2.3 million U.S. deliveries last year. Ford's hybrid sales jumped 40% to about 187,000, nearly double its EV sales of some 98,000.\n\nGM, by comparison, sold 114,432 EVs. The automaker plans to offer plug-in hybrids for 2027 as a short-term strategy to meet emissions regulations but has no plans to make traditional hybrids, which cost less and don't need charging.\n\n\"Ultimately, we believe that EVs are going to be the way forward,\" GM's Harvey said, \"complemented with some hybrids.\"\n\nAt a New York industry conference in February, CEO Barra called hybrids an interim solution, arguing that developing a vehicle with two propulsion systems - gas and electric - is an inefficient use of capital.\n\nGM might be better off sticking to EVs in part because it would now take substantial investment in hybrid powertrains to steal sales from entrenched competitors, said David Whiston, an automotive stock strategist at Morningstar Research.\n\n\"It would be hard for GM to compete head-on with Toyota in hybrids,\" he said.\n\nGM officials argue it's not missing out on sales in the hybrid boom because it offers other fuel-saving technologies, such as diesels and small, turbocharged gasoline engines.\n\nThe truck dilemma\n\nThe biggest obstacle to GM's all-electric ambitions, however, might be its own lucrative business in full-sized pickups and SUVs.\n\nGM's ambitions for a rapid electric truck transition have so far clashed with the challenges of making them affordable and capable enough to sell in large volumes. In 2022, GM planned annual capacity for 600,000 electric trucks at its Detroit Factory Zero plant and another factory it planned to reopen in nearby Orion Township. It has repeatedly delayed the Orion reopening, now scheduled for mid-2026.\n\nGM started delivering the Silverado EV RST First Edition, priced at $94,500, in mid-2024. But it sold just 9,000 electric Silverado and Sierra pickups last year out of about 900,000 total. Rivals' electric trucks introduced before last year - Ford's F-150 Lightning and Tesla's Cybertruck - had about 33,000 and 39,000 sales in 2024, respectively, but the overall electric truck segment remains tiny.\n\nThis year, GM hopes to boost sales with two new trim levels starting at about $57,000 and $73,000.\n\nOne drag on EV pickup sales is the fact that carrying or towing heavy payloads can dramatically reduce their driving range, requiring constant recharging.\n\nSeeking more range, automakers have added larger batteries, but that makes EV trucks extremely expensive, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry Insights.\n\nGM's highly profitable truck-and-SUV business has been pivotal in helping GM finance money-losing forays into EVs and autonomous vehicles. But it will struggle to squeeze the same profits from electric trucks, Abuelsamid said.\n\n\"For the foreseeable future,\" he said, \"they're probably not going to be able to get the same margins - not unless we have some major breakthrough on the battery front.\"\n\n(Reporting by Kalea Hall in Detroit; Editing by Brian Thevenot and David Clarke)",

            "content": "Ever walked back into your apartment or townhouse after a trip to the laundromat and found yourself wishing you could fit a washer-dryer in your kitchen or bathroom? With the best washer-dryer combos, you just might be able to.\n\nThese handy all-in-one hybrids save space by providing a washer with ventless drying built right in. A design long used in Europe, the new wave of American washer-dryer combos are built to tuck away into nooks and corners where it would be inconceivable to fit a laundry center.\n\nMost combos run on 110V power, and use condenser or heat-pump systems that dry your laundry without requiring an outside vent. Just don\u2019t get impatient; most of these hybrids work great when you learn them, but they dry more slowly and in smaller volumes than traditional units.\n\nTo help you find the best washer-dryer combo, we dug through spec sheets and read through thousands of reviews, factoring in both the innovative and the bad.\n\nCredit: Reviewed/ Beckett Dubay We loved the GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS' useful cycles and energy efficiency.\n\nMost Efficient GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS Quite new on the market, the GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS is a large heat pump washer-dryer combo that impressed us in lab testing with solid wash and dry performance, remarkable efficiency, and a user-friendly design. The only unit on this list to receive an Energy Star award, its heat pump delivers efficient drying cycles that will save you both energy and money over the long term. The GE\u2019s benefits don\u2019t stop with efficiency, however. A 4.8-cubic-foot capacity is available in the large Microban-primed, mold-resistant drum\u2014double the amount of space provided by many of the other washer-dryers on this list. This is especially useful in a washer-dryer combo, as many of these will do their best when filled only halfway to wash capacity, meaning this machine is capable of handling at least twice the load size of most. Just note, with an above-average height of 46.7 inches, this unit might not fit under every counter quite as well as others on this list. GE SmartHQ will keep your unit connected and keep you in control of some of its smart features, like a smart dispenser for detergent, anti-wrinkle steam drying, downloadable cycles, and more. With a five-year limited warranty on the drying system and a 10-year limited warranty on the motor, we think this new high-end combo is here to stay. It\u2019s expensive, but if you\u2019re looking for an efficient heat pump system that can wash and dry in one, it\u2019s got the most impressive feature set on the scene. Read our review of the GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS. Pros Extremely energy efficient\n\nGreat warranty\n\nSmart features Cons Heavy dryer loads may require additional drying time $2,194.00 from Abt\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Magic Chef Value that can fit in any apartment.\n\nBest Value Magic Chef MCSCWD27W5 Maybe you can afford around $1,000 for a washer-dryer but can\u2019t go much higher. If that\u2019s the case, the Magic Chef MCSCWD27W5 is a good bet. The affordable appliance brand offers a washer-dryer combo unit with 2.7 cubic feet of capacity. This Magic Chef model has a basic feature set. A condenser system, it delivers ventless drying with 16 wash cycles. Don\u2019t expect de-wrinkling steam or premium app connectivity, but you can rely on it for small daily laundry loads. Small enough to fit in an RV or trailer, the MCSCWD27W5 is a compact device with features that will fit into lots of homes. The unit comes with a one-year limited warranty. Pros Extra affordable\n\nDecent capacity Cons No smart features\n\nNo steam\n\nCredit: Reviewed / GE Steam away.\n\nBest Fit GE GFQ14ESSNWW Well apportioned to hide under a kitchen counter, and reliable enough to live with for years, the GE GFQ14ESSNWW is a remarkable washer-dryer combo unit perfectly targeted for the average user. It features 2.4 cubic feet of capacity, enough to clean and dry a good week\u2019s worth of T-shirts. While its condenser isn\u2019t a heat pump, it does a good job at moderate-sized loads, even if you don\u2019t want to fill the drum entirely. Fourteen cycles ensure you\u2019ll have the right setting for each load. The machine features a few tricks up its sleeve, like steam mode for sanitizing and wrinkle control. It also features an auto dispenser that releases loaded detergent at the right moment. With nearly 500 reviews, this washer-dryer has some of the best ratings among owners. And it comes with a one-year limited warranty for the entire appliance. Pros Solid performance\n\n1-year warranty\n\nSteam mode Cons Slow drying if overloaded $1,259.00 from Abt\n\nCredit: Reviewed / LG Invest in heat pump.\n\nBest Design LG LUWM101HWA High-end and capable, the LG Signature LUWM101HWA is a powerful heat pump washer-dryer that doesn\u2019t skimp on aesthetics. A sleek circular face and a bright LCD panel dominate the center of the machine, presenting a suave exterior that would perfectly accent a Scandinavian mountain house or chic Manhattan apartment. The unit features ThinQ app controls that let you control parts of the process from anywhere, and the app sends notifications when loads have completed. The machine also monitors each load and doses its own detergent. Like the LG WM3998HBA, this model includes a high-speed TurboWash, which is one among a total of 17 programs. This LG comes with a stellar warranty, including a lifetime drum warranty, 20 years on the inverter and direct drive motor, and a one-year limited parts and labor warranty. If you\u2019re unconstrained by budget and want a washer-dryer combo that\u2019s as sleek as it is high-tech, this 120V LG model may very well be the one for you. Pros Excellent warranty\n\nSmart features\n\nChic design Cons Lower capacity\n\nWhat to know before buying a washer-dryer combo\n\nThe best washer-dryer combos are an achievement of engineering that can often eliminate the need for a laundry room. However, most washer-dryer combos are capable of less volume and speed than a traditional washer and dryer set.\n\nIf you have limited space, this tradeoff might very well be worth it, but it\u2019s important to manage your expectations. For them to be effective, most combos will require that you spend some time learning both their accomplishments and their limitations\u2014once you do, most of these units can be made to do a great job.\n\nGenerally, we recommend combos for couples or single people living in smaller homes. Families, or anyone who often dries larger batches of clothing should carefully consider whether washer-dryer combos are capable of the volume that they require.\n\nHow does a washer dryer combo work?\n\nMost likely, when you think of a dryer you think of a classic American vented dryer. These dryers work by heating air from the room they inhabit and blowing it across tumbling clothes. This hot air is then vented and blown outdoors.\n\nWith nowhere to vent hot air to, ventless dryers instead use a different principle: condensation.\n\nVentless condenser dryers work by passing warm air through the laundry tub, they then use a coolant to condense moisture from the air. This condensation is then usually stored in a reservoir. Once the reservoir is full, it needs to be removed and drained.\n\nWhat is a heat pump?\n\nSome of the best washer-dryer combos are condensing units that use a system called a heat pump. These efficient systems use refrigerative condensers that achieve very cold temperatures. Think of a heater and an air-conditioner working hand in hand to wick the moisture out of your clothes. Unlike traditional condensing dryers, they don\u2019t exchange much heat with the surrounding room, yielding superior efficiency.\n\nSince AC units are often such energy hogs, it may seem counterintuitive that a system that uses a more powerful condenser to better refrigerate would have superior energy efficiency. However, heat pump systems achieve just that, recycling the internal air of the dryer repeatedly to yield maximum drying efficiency.\n\nWhile heat pumps are a nice feature that will save you money via better efficiency, for the time being, they\u2019re generally only available in more expensive models.\n\nHow to use a washer-dryer combo\n\nWasher-dryer combos work similarly to standard laundry machines. Most allow you to select from multiple wash and dry cycles for different soil levels. Many machines will select the appropriate dry cycle based on your wash load.\n\nOften these machines are more capable of washing a given amount of clothing in a reasonable time than they are of drying that same amount of clothing. So we recommend that to start you should begin with a small load and pay careful attention not to overload your device.\n\nGenerally, even the best washer-dryer combo units take more time to complete their cycles than standard washing machines and dryers do, so allot more time. However, though they take longer, washer-dryer combos eliminate the inconvenience of manually moving your laundry from your front-loading washer and into your electric dryer.\n\nFor specific instructions, we highly recommend that when you invest in a new washer-dryer combo unit, you thoroughly read the instruction manual, since most of us will bring habits we\u2019ve picked up from standard washers and dryers.\n\nAre washer-dryer combos good?\n\nYes. Generally, these units are much more efficient than traditional top and front-load washers and dryers, while the best washer-dryer combos are drastically so. Heat pump models save even more energy than traditional condensers.\n\nThe only Energy Star-certified unit on this list is the GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS, but according to Energy Star that model\u2019s estimated energy usage is less than one fourth of the energy usage of an Energy Star certified traditional dryer, the LG DLEX3700W\u2014which doesn\u2019t even figure in the energy usage of its paired washer.\n\nMore on clothes dryers\n\nMore Articles You Might Enjoy",

He is survived by his son Michael Siegel of Myrtle Beach,South Carolina.; son Brian Siegel and wife Diane of Arlington and granddaughters Anastasia and Erika; and daughter Suzanne Siegel of Marblehead. He is also survived by sister Carol Reis of Denver, Colorado, brother Robert Siegel and his wife Susan of Houston, Texas, along with nieces and nephews Martin Eiss, Christine Wyckoff, Jenny Voland and Leslie Beasse.\n\nCarl was born on March 16, 1933 in Buffalo, New York. After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a machinist\u2019s mate second class and ascended to the rank of lieutenant commander. After the Navy, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of South Carolina. He took his experience and knowledge to General Electric in Lynn where he worked for 27 years. Carl and his wife Harriette settled in Marblehead in 1960, where they raised their three children.\n\nFor those who knew Carl, they know that his achievements are too long to list. Some of his greatest contributions were his involvement in the Marblehead Rotary Club for 33 years, serving on the Recreation and Parks Department for five years, serving on the Marblehead Water & Sewer Board for 36 years, and also providing his knowledge and handiwork to the great sport of football. Not only did he re-design the model for bean bags used by the referees in the National Football League, but he was also a referee himself for 15 years as well as a long-term board member and coach to both Marblehead Midget Football & Marblehead Little League. Carl\u2019s greatest passion was to give back to the Marblehead community by being the town\u2019s do-it-all handyman. From planting the flowers on the traffic island at the corner of Maple and Lafayette, to hanging the lights on the lighthouse at Chandler Hovey Park over the 4th of July and Christmas holidays, to the rubber duck race and the annual Easter egg hunt that the Rotary Club of Marblehead sponsored, Carl said yes to everything with a smile on his face. If you were to drive on Evans Road, it was almost a given that you\u2019d see Carl working on a project in his garage, as he spent his life crafting and creating.\n\nCarl was a one-of-a-kind community member, father and grandfather who will be greatly missed by all. He was also a cherished friend to many, including Keith Taylor, Steve Leone, Jack Attridge and the entire Rotary Club, Amy & Bill McHugh, along with the entire staff of the Water & Sewer Department \u2014 just to name a few.\n\nA private burial and a celebration of life will be planned for a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Rotary Club of Marblehead, P.O. Box 1008, Marblehead, in memory of Carl Siegel.

Town Leaders have scheduled a \"Save the Housatonic\" rally in Boston at Sam Adams Park in front of Faneuil Hall on Thursday, Feb. 27 at noon.\n\nLee Town Administrator Christopher Brittain hopes this will raise awareness of Housatonic River pollution in the eastern part of the state.\n\n\"We're trying to get the word about this out to a different audience, to a different media, as well as, again, there's a lot of whether it be political, or EPA [Environmental Protection Agency], or GE [General Electric] they are all in that area,\" Brittain said.\n\nThe 2020 Settlement Agreement between General Electric and the Environmental Protection Agency mandated remediation efforts concerning polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination within the Housatonic River. This agreement stipulated that GE undertake cleanup operations while concurrently facilitating the exploration of advanced technologies for PCB mitigation.\n\nThe Housatonic River was contaminated with PCBs and other chemical waste products by the General Electric Company between 1932 and 1977 . The contamination stretches from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, through Connecticut, and into Long Island Sound.\n\nAdams Park is less than a mile from GE's Boston office.\n\nTown leaders, environmental experts, and even Lee Elementary School 4th grader Jenny Hogencamp will speak at the rally.\n\n\"Her family has a small farm and lives within a very short distance of the proposed UDF [Upland Disposal Facility] site,\" Brittain said.\n\nOther people speaking will be Lee select board members Bob Jones, Sean Regnier and Gordon Bailey. State Representative Leigh Davis will speak as well as environmental and health advocates.\n\nBrittain expressed that there are alternative methods to clean the Housatonic River, besides the UFD method specified in the cleanup permit. He wants to raise awareness about these other options.\n\n\"The permit does not set a minimum that GE has to take out of state, it only sets a maximum for what they have to book in the Berkshires in addition to that the permit also states the use of emerging technologies and alternative methods,\" said Brittain.\n\nHe claimed that the GE is only motivated by cost savings to avoid alternative PCB cleanups.\n\n\"There is a better way to do this clean up, and the company that polluted the river is not doing an adequate clean up in order for them to save money. That's the point we want to make at this event,\" he said.\n\nBrittain stated that the Housatonic River Initiative will sponsor a bus for anyone who wishes to join them. Those interested can call him at (413) 409-5976 to reserve a seat. He also welcomed those who prefer to provide their own transportation and show their support.\n\n\"We're really excited for the lineup of speakers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of people joining us and we are really grateful for that and I think it should be a really good event.\"",

With a focus on exceptional service, cutting-edge electric vehicles, and tailored buying experiences, he\u2019s redefining the auto industry for local and out-of-state customers alike.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about the history and mission of Garden City Jeep and what sets it apart from other dealerships on Long Island?\n\nWe\u2019re part of the VIP Auto Group, which has a great community of people. It\u2019s a really good location that services all of Long Island, plus the early parts of Queens and Brooklyn. We get a lot of people from the boroughs who take advantage of the fact that we have valet parking, which makes it easier to park and shop while not feeling like they\u2019re inconvenienced. We have what\u2019s called the VIP program, which gives you free lifetime amenities like oil and filter changes, state inspections, loaner cars, and so much more. Also, if we\u2019re servicing your car and the wait is going to be long, we\u2019ll Uber you back and forth for free. Plus, if you experience issues on the road, we offer 24/7 rescue and towing anywhere from Midtown Tunnel to Montauk Point.\n\nWhat would you say are some of the top-selling Jeep models at your dealership and what makes them so popular with customers?\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is the most awarded SUV ever, and now it comes in three different varieties. We have the Grand Cherokee five-passenger, which extends from a Laredo all the way up to a Summit. The Grand Cherokee Limited, which is the most popular model, always has aggressive and affordable programs for a great luxury SUV. Then there is the 4xe option, which gives you hybrid capabilities, helping you save on gas because it uses electric for up to 23 miles on a full charge. Finally, there is the Grand Cherokee L, which is the seven-passenger Grand Cherokee. It has ample utility for all your family needs and when the seats go down, it creates an incredible amount of space compared to most SUVs.\n\nHow does Garden City Jeep ensure a superior customer service experience from the initial visit to the post-purchase service?\n\nWell, first off, we start with our purpose, which is to create value and an unparalleled experience for every customer that\u2019s far superior to our competitors. We also have a mission statement \u2014 to be the biggest and best provider of automotive sales and service. And we empower our staff to provide every customer with the most memorable experience possible. We want that customer for life. We don\u2019t want to just sell a car and then forget about the customer. We want to be that home that you can come to and feel comfortable with. We empower our sales team to make every customer\u2019s experience memorable.\n\nHow has demand for electric and hybrid vehicles impacted your sales strategy? And what Jeep models are leading the way in that category?\n\nWe have the Grand Cherokee 4xe, Wrangler 4xe, and the Pacifica Hybrid, which are all hybrid models. The Wrangler 4xe gives you the ability to have fun by taking the top off the Jeep and turning it into a convertible. It\u2019s also fun to go off-roading in the Wrangler, whether it\u2019s on trails or on the beach. We also just announced the all-new, all-electric Dodge Charger and Wagoneer S, both arriving soon.\n\nWhat trends are you seeing shaping the industry and how are you preparing for them?\n\nAs more electric vehicles are produced, the more electric inventory we will have in the showroom. One of the things that we\u2019re doing to prepare for this is installing fast-level chargers inside and outside the dealership. This will help accommodate increasing sales that we feel will occur on these new models.\n\nAnd lastly, what advice would you give someone looking to purchase their first Jeep? And are there any specific features or packages you would recommend?\n\nDon\u2019t be shy to tell the salesperson what vehicle and features you want. I always tell my sales professionals to truly listen to a consumer\u2019s wants and needs. We don\u2019t want to be \u201cone and done\u201d with a customer. We want that customer for life. So, when you\u2019re coming in to look at a model, speak to the salesperson, let them be your advisor \u2014 they will guide you to the right options. You deserve to get the vehicle you want, and we\u2019re here to make that happen.\n\nPARTNER CONTENT",

            "content": "The Berkshire community sits on the banks of the Housatonic River, the county\u2019s main waterway that GE polluted with toxic forever chemicals in the mid-20th Century. As a controversial cleanup plan first announced in 2020 slowly navigates legal challenges and public outcry, residents face the reality that Lee will soon be home to both a new landfill and the nucleus of a massive project that will take at least 15 years and $600 million.\n\n\u201cWe don't consider it a good cleanup proposal, leaving 75 to 80% of the toxic materials still in the river, moving those materials just a few hundred feet from the river above a major aquifer,\" said town administrator Chris Brittain. \"And recently, the EPA even put out that there was 98 different proposals for alternative cleanup methods that could be used in their challenge grant.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Brittain and other Lee leaders will make their way to Sam Adams Park in downtown Boston by GE\u2019s corporate offices to hold a rally protesting the cleanup.\n\n\u201cWe're just trying to point out that this is not an adequate cleanup for Lee and Berkshire County, that there are other better methods, and that we're asking for General Electric to do the right thing and do a proper cleanup of the river,\u201d Brittain told WAMC.\n\nLittle has come so far from Lee\u2019s legal efforts to challenge the cleanup, and Brittain says GE has managed to almost entirely avoid direct contact with the town.\n\n\u201cThe only communication we've gotten is anything that's- Forums that have been set up through the EPA, we've never had the opportunity to actually sit down with GE and talk about this,\" He said. \"It's been through whatever meetings have been set up through the EPA and just seeing a GE PowerPoint.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the rally is to tie Lee\u2019s fate in with larger national narratives about corporate malfeasance and the price local communities pay.\n\n\u201cWhat's happening in Berkshire County and Housatonic River Corridor is just a microcosm of what's been happening elsewhere across the country, not only with GE but with other multibillion dollar corporations. It has been a terrible environmental catastrophe that's been unfolding for decades now,\" said Select board member Bob Jones, who agrees that the proposed cleanup is inadequate for the Lee community. \u201cWe're not looking to punish GE, even though they did commit, these are actually major crimes that have been committed since the late 1930s- We're not looking to punish them. We're looking to find a way to resolve this in a constructive way, so that this can actually be the very beginning of a cleanup that will be improved over the years for the next generations, instead of just kicking the can down the road.\u201d\n\nFor Jones, Brittain, and other members of both the Lee and Berkshire community, the Housatonic River and its treatment at the hands of GE remains an open wound.\n\n\u201cIt's an environmental treasure trove, with the animals, the various species that are here,\" said Jones. \"It's an absolutely beautiful, pristine river. And we know going back all the way to the to the first people here, the indigenous people, it's a main artery for us. And the reason the very towns, the towns even exist along this where they do is because of the river- And that has been taken away from us.\u201d\n\nJones says that examples of how other communities have better negotiated environmental policies are not hard to find.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is you can go to Vermont, different areas where the rivers are not polluted, and you see thriving communities, tourism, beautiful homes, and they they're able to build upon their rivers,\" he told WAMC. \"We have signs along our rivers- Don't eat the fish, don't go in the water, don't breathe the air. And what is that? That's not something that Lee or any of these towns brought upon ourselves- This is something that's been perpetrated by a multibillion dollar corporation.\u201d\n\nWith new leadership at the EPA in the form of Trump appointee and former New York Congressman Lee Zeldin, WAMC reached out to the agency to ask if the Housatonic cleanup has been impacted.\n\nIn a statement, the EPA says Zeldin had been \u201cvery clear about his commitment to the agency\u2019s mission of protecting human health and the environment,\u201d and that the Trump administration is committed to continue the cleanup of toxic sites.\n\nGE issued its own statement to WAMC, saying that the company is \u201cfocused on achieving EPA approval for a Housatonic River cleanup plan that protects human health and the environment.\u201d\n\nGE presented its most recent draft of the revised cleanup plan at a December meeting in Pittsfield.",

Offshore wind power generation requires efficient and low-loss transmission solutions to deliver electricity to the mainland grid. HVDC technology is preferred over traditional AC systems due to its ability to transport electricity over long distances with minimal losses. As countries invest heavily in offshore wind projects, the demand for HVDC transmission infrastructure is expected to rise, creating lucrative business opportunities for industry players.Segmentation Analysis of the HVDC Systems Market:By Type\u2022 Point-to-point Transmission\u2022 Back-to-back Station\u2022 Multi-terminal SystemBy Application\u2022 Underground Power Transmission\u2022 Overhead Transmission\u2022 Offshore Power Transmission\u2022 OtherDownload Sample 250 Pages of HVDC Systems Market Report @Geographically, the distinctive analysis of consumption, revenue, market share, and growth rate of the subsequent areas:\u2022 North America (U.S., Canada, Mexico)\u2022 Eastern Europe (Russia, Bulgaria, The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Rest of Eastern Europe)\u2022 Western Europe (Germany, UK, France, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Rest of Western Europe)\u2022 Asia Pacific (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, The Philippines, Australia, New-Zealand, Rest of APAC)\u2022 Middle East & Africa (Tu\u0308rkiye, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Israel, South Africa)\u2022 South America (Brazil, Argentina, Rest of SA)Key insights provided by the report that could help you take critical strategic decisions?\u2022 Regional report analysis highlighting the consumption of products/services in a region also shows the factors that influence the market in each region.\u2022 Reports provide opportunities and threats faced by suppliers in the HVDC Systems industry around the world.\u2022 The report shows regions and sectors with the fastest growth potential.\u2022 A competitive environment that includes market rankings of major companies, along with new product launches, partnerships, business expansions, and acquisitions.\u2022 The report provides an extensive corporate profile consisting of company overviews, company insights, product benchmarks, and SWOT analysis for key market participants.\u2022 This report provides the industry's current and future market outlook on the recent development, growth opportunities, drivers, challenges, and two regional constraints emerging in advanced regions.Discount on the Research ReportWhy Invest in this Report?-Leverage Data for Strategic Decision-Making-Craft Expansion Strategies for Diverse Markets-Conduct Comprehensive Competitor Analysis-Gain Insight into Competitors' Financial Metrics-Benchmark Against Key Competitors-Formulate Region-Specific Growth StrategiesKey Benefits Of The Report\u21aaThis study presents the analytical depiction of the global HVDC Systems industry along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.\u21aaThe report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with detailed analysis of the HVDC Systems market share.\u21aaThe current market is quantitatively analyzed from 2024 to 2032 to highlight the HVDC Systems market growth scenario.\u21aaPorter's five forces analysis illustrates the potency of buyers & suppliers in the market.\u21aaThe report provides a detailed HVDC Systems market analysis based on the present and future competitive intensity of the market.Get Detailed TOC and Overview of Report @Contact us:Vishwanath K (PR & Marketing Manager)IMR Market ReportsPhone: +91-81800-96367Email: sales@imrmarketreports.comWeb:About Us:IMR Market Reports is a visionary market research company who is ready to assist their clients to grow their business by offering strategies through our market research reports for gaining success.

It\u2019s a walk of about 15 minutes from there to GE\u2019s corporate offices across from South Station.\n\nSelect Board members Bob Jones and Sean Regnier, town administrator Christopher Brittain and Lee Elementary School fourth grader Jenny Hogencamp are among expected speakers making the 126-mile trip east on the Massachusetts Turnpike. They\u2019ll be joined at the podium by environmental and health advocates, and state Rep. Leigh Davis is also expected to speak.\n\nA website, SaveTheHousatonic.com, outlines the town's goals and concerns.\n\n\u201cThe Town of Lee and other communities of the Berkshires are asking GE to do the right thing: dredge and transport the toxic sediment to a pre-existing [licensed] facility or find ways where it can be bioremediated and destroyed,\u201d a news release announcing the event says.\n\nThe goal, leaders said, is for Lee to make its case not only to GE, but to the eastern side of the commonwealth, where state lawmakers and media are concentrated.\n\nHogencamp is a Lee resident whose family lives near the site proposed for the Upland Disposal Facility, Brittain said. \u201cI know she wants to talk about that and also the fact that people in her generation still can\u2019t use the river,\u201d he said.\n\nBrittain said the idea came after a similar event last fall along the river. \u201cThe idea was we should bring it to the other end of the state where GE\u2019s office is, where the EPA [Region 1] office is. We wanted to reach another audience in Eastern Mass.\u201d\n\nAnd since EPA\u2019s technology challenge for the cleanup resulted in 98 proposals from 40 countries on alternative cleanup and remediation methods, Brittain said, \u201cwe know there\u2019s better ways to have a better cleanup.\u201d\n\nBrittain noted that the cleanup permit does not set a maximum for how much higher-contaminated sediment has to be shipped out of the area. Rather, it sets a minimum of 100,000 cubic yards.\n\nHe also noted that the amount of lower-contaminated sediments has a maximum of 1.1 million cubic feet of sediment \u2014 not a minimum.\n\n\u201cThe permit also does allow for new and alternative treatment methods to be considered,\u201d he added. \u201cGE has the ability within the permit to do a better job than what they\u2019re doing. We\u2019re appealing to that \u2014 you\u2019re an $11 billion corporation trying to save money, and doing what we don\u2019t consider to be the right cleanup for Berkshire County.\u201d\n\nThe original cleanup approved by GE in 2016 required all contaminated sediment to be shipped out of the area.\n\nThe company, which used PCBs in making power transformers and disposed of them in the Housatonic, agreed to remove PCBs from its Pittsfield campus, the river and its floodplains in a consent decree approved in 2000. The first 2 miles of river cleanup, in Pittsfield, has already been completed; the remainder stretches from the West Branch-East Branch confluence in Pittsfield to Rising Pond Dam in Great Barrington.\n\nSome might ask: Why is Lee seeking a different cleanup now, after a revised cleanup agreement was reached in a controversial closed-door mediation process approved by the EPA and defended by a U.S. Appeals Court?\n\nFor one thing, Lee never wanted the cleanup it got, or the landfill proposed for the former Lane Construction Corp. property. When its Select Board approved the revised cleanup plan reached in closed-door mediation, voters replaced the board at the ballot box.\n\nBut there have been a few changes in the five years since the revised cleanup permit was approved.\n\nBrittain noted that public comments and pressure from local, state and federal lawmakers helped convince EPA and GE that GE's initial transportation plan was overly reliant upon trucking and did not adequately consider rail. The company returned with a revised plan making greater use of rail and hydraulic suction to move sediment from place to place.\n\nAt the same time, Lee has brought a lawsuit against GE and Monsanto, which manufactured PCBs, claiming that the companies\u2019 actions damaged the community and prevented recreational use, fishing and hunting along the Housatonic River.\n\nThe lawsuit, originally filed in Berkshire Superior Court and moved to U.S. District Court by GE, alleges the companies knew PCBs impacted human health and the environment, constituting \u201cintentional infliction of harm to humans and the environment.\"\n\nIt cites an agreement signed Jan. 21, 1972, in which GE agreed not to sue Monsanto for claims arising from the environmental and health harm caused by PCBs in return for a continued supply of the chemicals it used to insulate power transformers.\n\nIn response, three of the defendants, Monsanto, Solutia LLC and Pharmacia LLC, alleged that the town's claims should be rejected for several reasons, including noncompliance with federal court procedure rules, a statute of limitations and the federal laws governing the Rest of River cleanup.\n\nGeneral Electric filed a motion to dismiss on similar grounds in August.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a ruling or motion filed in the lawsuit since last fall. Brittain said both sides are waiting on U.S. District Judge Mark G. Mastroianni to rule on the motions filed by the town and the defendants.",

            "content": "Make AI Finance Electrical Grid Expansion | Opinion\n\nThe cost of electricity could double or treble in the next few years. But don't blame this on solar and wind , now the cheapest sources of energy. Much of the price increase will be caused by data centers for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nArtificial intelligence is suddenly chewing up vast amounts of electricity. Electric vehicles will also increase demand for electricity, but this increase will be gradual because adoption of EVs will also be gradual. The increase in demand by AI, by contrast, will be much more abrupt.\n\nThanks to this sudden projected increase in the electricity we need, major price hikes are a distinct possibility.\n\nFor many decades, American demand for electricity increased gradually. Efficiency gains (like LED lights) largely offset population increase. Electrical utilities were therefore taken by surprise by the sudden upswing in predicted demand due to AI.\n\nThe cost of electricity reflects the capital investments needed to produce and deliver it. Increased demand will require large investments, so the average cost of electricity will have to go up. But intelligent government policy could head off increases for the average family\n\nWe merely need to make AI corporations pay significantly more per kilowatt-hour than households and non-AI businesses do.\n\nBillions of dollars are being invested in AI because expected profits are immense. If this expectation is correct, AI corporations can afford to pay a lot more for electricity.\n\nThe alternative, spreading the increased cost of electricity to the general public, would force us all to subsidize the immense profits AI backers expect.\n\nThe New York Times recently noted, \"New suppliers of electricity to the grid are often required to pay for upgrades if their addition might strain the network.\" But it would make more sense instead to make AI organizations pay since they are placing additional demand for electricity on the grid networks. The electricity suppliers are helping meet that increased demand, and anything increasing their costs would ultimately have to be paid by the people using the electricity they produce.\n\nRequiring AI operations have to pay more for electricity could also be considered a fine for prolonging the use of coal and natural gas to generate electricity. Burning fossil fuels increases atmospheric carbon dioxide, intensifying the global warming already increasing extreme weather and driving up insurance costs.\n\nThis also means that millions of Americans are bearing the costs AI causes to their environment, while investors in AI reap all the benefits.\n\nIf it weren't for the increased demand by AI, increased production of solar and wind energy would drive the dangerous carbon fuels off the market faster. The rapid increase in electricity demand forces producers to continue using the carbon fuels despite the fact they are more expensive.\n\nWe probably can't stop AI from succeeding. If the U.S. tried to do this, it would make us vulnerable to foreign countries where governments did no such thing. But the U.S. could certainly make AI pay its own way and compensate the interests it injures.\n\nWise public policy might therefore not only require AI to pay more for electricity , but also to pay something for the human labor it displaces. Some years ago, before AI took off, Microsoft funder Bill Gates suggested taxing robots that replaced human workers. AI is probably going to displace even more workers than robots have.\n\nBy analogy, it might also be only fair to require AI operations to pay the equivalent of payroll taxes (financing Medicare and Social Security) for a large number of workers, even if it actually employs only a few.\n\nSuch payments for workers displaced by AI could extend the period before the Social Security Trust Fund runs dry, postponing an increase in general payroll taxes or a major decrease in Social Security benefits.\n\nIf AI is going to dominate the future, let it share its profits with the general public.\n\n\u2014 Paul F. deLespinasse is professor emeritus of political science and computer science at Adrian College.

            "content": "P&W and GE successfully passed the Detailed Design Review of their offerings for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s next generation NGAP engine, expected to power the NGAD manned fighter.\n\nPratt & Whitney and General Electric Aerospace have announced the successful completion of the Detailed Design Review (DDR) of their offerings for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program, the next generation engine which is supposed to be used for the Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft.\n\nThe announcement follows the recent news about the Air Force deciding to accelerate the development of the engines with the upgrade of the contracts originally awarded to both companies in 2022. P&W and GE previously completed another key design review in February 2024 and December 2023, respectively.\n\nPratt & Whitney\u2019s XA103 engine\n\nPratt & Whitney, which is now part of RTX, announced on Feb. 20, 2025, the completion of the Detailed Design Review (DDR) of the XA103 engine, its pitch for NGAP. Interestingly, the company noted that it presented its work \u201cdirectly from its collaborative digital environment, providing reviewers with immediate access to all the data and material to satisfy the stringent criteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe significance of this first fully digital review cannot be understated,\u201d said Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt & Whitney\u2019s Military Engines business. \u201cDigital processes throughout the lifecycle are crucial to rapidly and efficiently deliver advanced warfighter capabilities. As we celebrate our centennial, the digital tools and processes that our NGAP team has demonstrated, and will continue to advance, will be at the foundation of our technology maturation for our future next-gen solutions.\u201d\n\nNow that the DDR is complete, the company said that the development team can begin procuring hardware for the construction of the XA103 prototype ground demonstrator. The testing of the engine demonstrator is expected in the late 2020s.\n\n\u201cFor decades, propulsion has been a key differentiator for the United States, and we are working with the U.S. Air Force to make sure it stays that way,\u201d said Chris Flynn, vice president of Military Development Programs at Pratt & Whitney. \u201cCollaborating with the U.S. Air Force, we have supported every generation of jet engine development since World War II. XA103, our adaptive engine for the future, will continue to advance our digital and agile design and development capabilities while advancing the propulsion capability for the warfighter.\u201d\n\nIn the press statement, Pratt & Whitney described its proposed design for the NGAP engine saying it has an adaptive architecture which enables its components to actively adjust for optimized fuel efficiency, survivability, and power and thermal management. Previously, the company said these are key to enabling future air dominance capabilities, such as the required range, weapon and sensor capability, and persistence that platforms will require to meet evolving operational needs.\n\nThe technologies and architectures of the NGAP program are being informed by the U.S. Air Force previous investment in the Adaptive Engine Transition Program, whose learnings are considered invaluable as some of the technologies could be \u201cportable\u201d between the two programs. In the end, the goal of the NGAP engine is to surpass the capabilities of fourth- and fifth-generation engines, says the company.\n\nGeneral Electric Aerospace\u2019s XA102 engine\n\nJust a day earlier, on Feb. 19, 2025, General Electric Aerospace announced the successful completion of the Detailed Design Review (DDR) for its XA102 adaptive cycle engine. The company says the review validated the readiness of the digital engine model for the next phase of development.\n\nNotably, the press statement mentioned that the XA102 is the first engine in GE Aerospace\u2019s history to be developed using model-based systems engineering (MBSE), which represents a transformative shift in how advanced propulsion systems are designed and tested. MBSE is a relatively new methodology which uses digital modeling and simulation to support the entire lifecycle of a system, from conception and design to verification and validation activities, through to decommissioning.\n\nMBSE is considered more efficient than traditional methods, and it helps in identifying and resolving problems even before physical prototypes are built. Also, it allows to reduce the risk of errors thanks to the visual and interactive nature of models which improve communication and decision-making among engineering teams, while also allowing greater traceability, complexity, accuracy and speed.\n\n\u201cGE Aerospace is making great strides with model-based engineering, which has been instrumental in the success of the XA102 engine design,\u201d said Dr. Steve \u201cDoogie\u201d Russell, vice president and general manager of Edison Works at GE Aerospace. \u201cAs we transition into the procurement and build phase, we will continue to incorporate this innovative approach while working closely with our supply chain partners to advance the engine toward a full-scale demonstration.\u201d\n\nSimilarly to P&W, after the completion of the DDR, GE Aerospace has been awarded the next contract phase to procure, assemble and test a XA102 full scale demonstrator engine. Interestingly, the mention of the contract immediately links the DDR to the recent increase in the funding for the NGAP contracts.\n\nIn fact, the contracts\u2019 notices mentioned that \u201cthe work includes design, analysis, rig testing, prototype engine build and testing, and weapon system integration.\u201d This could possibly imply that the DDR was one of the conditions which were met before the new contracts were awarded.\n\nAmong the critical aspects of its adaptive cycle engine, the company says it will provide greater range and significantly more thermal management capability compared to today\u2019s most advanced combat engine. While GE did not disclose a timeline, the testing of the XA102 should be expected by the late 2020s, similarly to P&W.\n\nNext Generation Adaptive Propulsion\n\nBoth General Electric and Pratt & Whitney previously designed engines for the Air Force\u2019s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), researching potential options for replacing the engines of the F-35 fleet with an improved and more fuel-efficient adaptive cycle engine. However, in 2023 the service decidedd to cancel the program and instead upgrade the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine.\n\nGE\u2019s XA100 and P&W\u2019s XA101, developed for AETP, became the foundation of the improved XA102 and XA103 offerings for the NGAP program. As adaptive cycle engines, these are expected to be able to adjust in flight, providing either more power or operating in a more fuel-efficient, according to the situation.\n\nGeneral Electric previously stated that the XA100 engine was around 25% more efficient than the existing F135 powerplant, while also offering between 10% and 20% more thrust. According to officials, the adaptive cycle engine technologies developed under the AETP and NGAP programs could herald a \u201crevolutionary leap\u201d in airplane propulsion.\n\nBoth companies are now moving towards the manufacturing full scale engine demonstrators and testing, but current plans for NGAP foresee eventually eliminating one of the two suppliers from the program. However, the future of NGAD, which is expected to use these engines, is still uncertain, adding some uncertainty also to NGAP.\n\nIn fact, the future of the NGAD sixth-generation aircraft is suspended and awaiting a decision by the new Trump administration. The program underwent an extensive review in 2024, with the objective of reassessing the requirements for the 6th generation fighter and explore whether the development strategy aligns with the evolving threat landscape and budget realities. While the Air Force appeared to back the manned 6th gen fighter, the final decision is in the hands of the government.",

            "content": "And while the two were both politically conservative, Welch was more of a country-club Republican, partial to golf and no fan \u2014 at least earlier on \u2014 of Donald Trump. While a savvy political operator, Welch was unlikely to have decamped to Mar-a-Lago to personally and intensely cozy up to the president-elect, as Musk did. (In 2016, Welch withdrew his support for Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, writing on social media, \u201cUnfortunately, wrong messenger\u2026Party must change nominee now.\u201d)\n\nBut the two shared a common business philosophy: Cut as much fat as possible.\n\nWelch believed G.E. had become too bureaucratic and bloated. He slashed billions of dollars in costs, and prided himself on weeding out employees who just weren\u2019t making it. He became an apostle of the Six Sigma approach, inspiring other C.E.O.s. Corporate profits \u2014 and G.E.\u2019s stock price \u2014 exploded under his watch.\n\nThat won Welch acclaim from investors and surviving employees. Consider this: When he became G.E.\u2019s chief in 1981, its market value was $12 billion. At his departure, right before Sept. 11, 2001, that had grown to some $650 billion, making the conglomerate the world\u2019s most valuable company by many stretches. G.E. became known as an incubator of top managerial talent, with alumni becoming C.E.O.s of many Fortune 500 companies. But it also made Welch a polarizing figure: He became known in many circles as \u201cNeutron Jack,\u201d a moniker he despised.\n\nMusk essentially took Welch\u2019s playbook into overdrive. The social network now known as X operates with just 25 percent of the work force it had when he acquired it in 2022. Tales of his relentless cost-cutting at Tesla and SpaceX are the stuff of biographies, and they can now be seen at work in the Trump administration. And Musk has made no apologies for his approach, acknowledging that he has had to sometimes rehire workers in crucial roles.\n\nThat approach has certainly cost Musk some popularity among much of the general public recently, and he still faces lawsuits from aggrieved former employees of X. But investors have snapped up debt in X at par, seemingly hopeful that the company\u2019s prospects are on the mend. And he has seemingly inspired counterparts at Meta, Google, Amazon and beyond to rethink how to get by with less \u2014 much less. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has openly spoken about cutting \u201clow performers\u201d; shares in the parent company of Instagram and Facebook have increased nearly 50 percent in the past year, putting its market value at nearly $2 trillion.

            "content": "DALLAS \u2014 The future of aviation revolves around sustainability. But building a greener, more environmentally friendly industry is nothing new.\n\nEngine makers are a prime target for reducing aviation's impact on the planet. As well as reducing emissions from their power plants, they must also strive to reduce fuel burn, thus reducing costs for their airline customers.\n\nOver the years, there have been various innovative designs, one of which was the 'Prop-fan/Unducted fan,' also known as an 'Open Rotor Engine.'\n\nAn Unducted Fan has a large number of highly twisted blades housed outside of the engine cowling. Photo: NASA\n\nEarly Days\n\nBack in the 1940s, American propeller maker Hamilton Standard looked at creating new blades so that its power plants could match the performance of the emerging turbofan/jet engines. Sadly, noise levels, blade stress, and flutter issues caused the concept to be dropped.\n\nThe crippling oil crisis of the 1970s led airlines to call upon plane makers to develop new technology to reduce their costs. Led by the US space agency NASA, teams began looking at installing a more fuel-efficient propellor that could operate at the same speed and altitude as a jet engine.\n\nIn October 1975, the 'Advanced Turboprop Project' was announced, promising a massive fuel saving of 30 to 35%. Development continued, albeit at a slow pace, and in 1981, Hamilton Standard was given a contract to produce a full-size working version called the SR-1.\n\nHamilton Standard's SR-1 prototype. Photo: The US National Archives\n\nDrawing Board to Reality\n\nUtilizing the initial test work done by NASA, General Electric (GE) began developing its own Unducted Fan Engine (UDF), the GE36, in 1982. Promising a 30% reduction in fuel burn without decreasing inflight cruise speeds, NASA awarded GE a US$20.4 million contract in February 1984.\n\nBoeing agreed to utilize one of its 727-100s (N32720) as a testbed for the GE36. Its first flight took to the skies on August 20, 1986. Numerous test flights were carried out with the power plant achieving a cruise speed of Mach .84 at an altitude of 39,000 feet.\n\nMeanwhile, engine rival Pratt & Whitney (P&W) had teamed up with Allison Engine Company which had been developing its own UDF, the Model 578-DX.\n\nAttached to a Gulfstream II, the 578-DXs first flight took to the air on March 28, 1987. An extensive test program ensued with 73 flights over 133 hours, costing an estimated US$56 million.\n\nGeneral Electric's GE36 was the first Propfan to take to the skies. Photo: NASA\n\nBoeing Vs. McDonnell Douglas\n\nThese new engine types came when plane makers sought to develop new fuel-efficient airliners.\n\nBoeing had officially launched its 7J7 program at the 1985 Paris Air Show, the same show where GE and P&W were showcasing their UDF engines.\n\nWhile GE and P&W had been developing Propfan engines to be located at the rear of the fuselage, International Aero Engines (IAE) was studying a design that could be housed on the wing.\n\nAn artist's impression of the 7J7. Photo: Boeing\n\nThe IAE V2500SF 'SuperFan' was launched in July 1986, and by December that year, the manufacturer had offered the type to Airbus to power its new A340 jets. Orders came, with Lufthansa (LH), Alitalia (AZ), UTA (UT), Sabena (SN) and Finnair (AY) all opting for the engine. Airbus also planned on using the V2500SF for its A320 aircraft and Boeing added the power plant into the mix for its 7J7s.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonnell Douglas (McD) was developing two Propfan variants of its MD-80, the MD-91X, and the MD-92X. The 100-150 seat aircraft were mooted to enter service in the early 1990s, and marketing for the new aircraft began in 1985.\n\nAn artist's impression of the MD-92X. Photo: McDonnell Douglas\n\nFacing Headwinds\n\nBut doubts about the viability of UDF engines were increasing. P&W was running massively behind schedule with its Model 578-DX. In April 1987, IAE canceled its 'SuperFan' project altogether. This subsequently led Boeing to delay its 7J7 project indefinitely in December 1987.\n\nBut McD pressed on with plans to use both the GE and P&W engines on its next-generation airliner. It modified one of its MD-80 jets with a GE36 power plant in 1987.\n\nThe aircraft carried out one hundred and sixty-five hours of testing over 93 flights. The results were promising, and McD even began discussing offering retrofits to its existing MD-80 airframes. It also looked at a military variant of the MD-91. Known as the Long-Range Anti-Submarine Warfare Capable Aircraft (LRAACA), it would replace the US Navy's P-3 Orion aircraft.\n\nIn September 1988, McD flew its UDF prototype to the Farnborough Air Show in an attempt to garner sales. But the moment had passed. Despite finally managing to add a prototype PW-Allison 578-DX to an airframe in early 1989, in May that year the manufacturer decided to terminate the MD-9X project and with it, the Propfan engine dream.\n\nThe MD-80 GE36 testbed is seen at the 1988 Farnborough Air Show. Photo: Andrew Thomas from Shrewsbury, UK, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nPart of the reason was the continued delays with P&W's engine that would delay the aircraft's launch. GE was also unprepared to develop its GE36 further until McD had at least 150 firm orders.\n\nAnother major issue was that oil prices had begun to drop dramatically when these new engines finally flew. Therefore, fuel costs were no longer seen as an issue for airlines. Propfans were also up to 40% more expensive than the turbofan engines it hoped to replace.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas thought it was the future of its airliners. Boeing wanted it for a unique new jet. Global airlines liked its massively reduced fuel costs. But sadly, engine manufacturers couldn't make the propfan work.\n\nCFM believes that 'open fan architecture is the most efficient and sustainable option' for future engine technology. Photo: CFM\n\nThe Future\n\nDespite dropping the UDF program, GE utilized its findings to develop composite fan blades for the mighty GE90, which, when introduced by British Airways (BA) on its Boeing 777 fleet in November 1995, was the world's largest jet engine.\n\nNumerous other plane makers looked at using Propfan engines to varying success. The Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov used four 'Progress D-27', designed by Ivchenko-Progress design Bureau, to power its mighty AN-70 transporters. It also planned on using a similar power plant for the wide-bodied AN-180 but the aircraft was never built.\n\nOn June 14, 2021, CFM International announced its RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, which will look at developing a new Propfan to power the next generation of airliners.\n\nCFM declared that the engine, with its \"open-fan architecture,\" will be 20% more efficient than today's examples. It hopes to begin testing with a demonstrator by 2025, with a planned entry into service by the mid-2030s.\n\nAs oil prices once again reach record highs, we may once again see aircraft and engine manufacturers revisit the idea of the Unducted Fan engine.\n\nFeatured Image: McDonnell Douglas fitted both the GE36 and P&W 578-DX to an MD-80 demonstrator.\n\nStay connected at every stop along your journey!

            "content": "The European Union is facing pressure from electric transport groups to reject the demands of European automakers seeking to weaken the 2025 CO2 emission targets and related fines, Reuters news report said.\n\nTwo organizations, E-Mobility Europe and ChargeUp Europe, sent a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They urged the EU to uphold existing regulations and not accommodate the car manufacturers\u2019 requests for more lenient emission standards.\n\nThe letter emphasized that the EU should not allow a slower phase-in of emission targets or permit fines to be calculated based on a multi-year average. Instead, any penalties collected should be directed toward supporting the transition to electric vehicles within the bloc.\n\nThe value of the European automotive market is expected to reach nearly $29.55 billion by 2030 from $16.26 billion in 2023.\n\nEuropean carmakers, struggling to compete with Chinese manufacturers and bracing for potential tariffs from the United States, have been pushing for relief from fines they claim could reach 15 billion euros ($15.7 billion) if they fail to meet CO2 limits in 2025.\n\nHowever, the electric transport groups argue that relaxing these regulations would further disadvantage Europe in the EV market compared to China and would discourage investment in key areas such as charging infrastructure, battery development, and manufacturing. They warn that any delay in implementing stricter CO2 targets could have long-term negative consequences for Europe\u2019s electric vehicle industry.\n\nE-Mobility Europe represents a broad coalition of stakeholders, including EV manufacturers, supply chain companies, fleet operators, and infrastructure providers, while ChargeUp Europe focuses specifically on the EV charging industry.\n\nNotably, Tesla is a member of both organizations. One of the arguments made by EU automakers is that weak consumer demand, partly due to concerns about insufficient charging infrastructure, is hindering their ability to meet emissions targets.\n\nHowever, Aurelien de Meaux, CEO of charging company Electra, has dismissed this claim as misleading. He asserts that existing charging stations across the EU have the capacity to handle five to seven times more vehicles than they currently do without reaching saturation. Furthermore, he highlighted the significant investments being made in charging infrastructure, which he argues counter the automakers\u2019 narrative.\n\nIn their letter, the transport groups maintain that the 2025 CO2 targets are feasible, citing the introduction of 11 new EV models priced below 25,000 euros and a 40 percent year-on-year increase in EV sales as of January 2025.\n\nThey also dispute the automakers\u2019 claim regarding the projected 15 billion euro fines, stating that the estimate is based on sales data from only the first six months of 2024 and is therefore inaccurate. According to de Meaux, a more realistic projection suggests fines of approximately 4-6 billion euros, which could be reduced by half through the trading of credits with other companies.\n\nThe letter further advocates for policies that would encourage corporate fleets to transition to electric vehicles, given that fleet purchases account for around 60 percent of new car sales. By maintaining stringent emissions targets and reinforcing incentives for electrification, the EU could strengthen its position in the EV sector and avoid falling behind global competitors.",

We did some digging, and we found some concerning factors in the details.\n\nTo understand the value of a company's earnings growth, it is imperative to consider any dilution of shareholders' interests. In fact, Portland General Electric increased the number of shares on issue by 8.1% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. As a result, its net income is now split between a greater number of shares. To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to per share value. Check out Portland General Electric's historical EPS growth by .\n\nHow Is Dilution Impacting Portland General Electric's Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\n\nPortland General Electric has improved its profit over the last three years, with an annualized gain of 28% in that time. In comparison, earnings per share only gained 10% over the same period. And at a glance the 37% gain in profit over the last year impresses. But in comparison, EPS only increased by 29% over the same period.

Nonetheless, it's still worth noting that its earnings per share have grown at 10% over the last three years. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

A 2020 agreement for the remediation of the Rest of River\u2014the portion of the federal Superfund site that spans from the confluence of the river\u2019s east and west tributaries in Pittsfield through Connecticut\u2014mandated the dredged materials containing the highest level of PCB concentration be sent out of the area while the lower-level contaminants be deposited into a to-be-created upland disposal facility (UDF) in Lee. However, Lee officials and residents have long maintained that this agreement was made behind closed doors and is unsafe for the community but have so far failed in their legal attempts to overturn the plan. Instead, they have pushed Environmental Protection Agency representatives responsible for implementing the remedy to consider alternative remediation methods such as destroying the toxins in place.\n\nAccording to Lee Select Board member Robert \u201cBob\u201d Jones, who addressed the event during the group\u2019s February 18 meeting, the upcoming program aims to \u201ctry to generate some interest in not only local press but regional press in Boston.\u201d \u201cLee is a small town [in] the Berkshires, forgotten sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re going to go to them this time and see what we can do.\u201d\n\nJones said the program\u2019s goal is to have media outlets that haven\u2019t covered the town\u2019s plight engage in their advocacy. \u201cNow the Town of Lee is asking GE to do the right thing: dredge and destroy the chemicals it dumped into the Housatonic,\u201d according to a news release.\n\nThe rally site is less than a mile from Boston\u2019s GE facility, and speakers will address the desire for \u201ca permanent, durable clean-up solution for the polluted waterway,\u201d the news release stated.\n\nEnvironmental group Housatonic River Initiative (HRI) is sponsoring a coach bus trip to the event, with reservations available by contacting Town Administrator Christopher Brittain at (413) 409-5976.

It is designed to collect and convert electricity generated by offshore wind turbines or other energy sources, typically through high-voltage transmission systems, before transmitting it to the mainland grid. Offshore substations house electrical equipment like transformers, switchgear, and control systems, which help ensure the efficient and safe delivery of power. These substations are built to withstand harsh marine conditions and are often located far from the coast, either floating or mounted on the seabed.List of the Key Players in the Offshore Substation Market:General Electric Company, Aker Solutions, Envision Group, Petrofac Limited, Burns & McDonnell, Hitachi Energy, HSM Offshore Energy BV, SLPE, Hollandia and SiemensIndustry Development:In December 2024, SLPE secured a contract to develop foundation designs for HVDC offshore substations for the Centre Manche 1 and 2 offshore wind projects in France. Each substation will have a capacity of 1.25 GW, with jacket structures estimated to weigh around 7,000 tonnes.Also, in December 2024, Aker Solutions and ABB will conduct the first-phase FEED for the 560-MW GreenVolt floating offshore wind project in the central UK North Sea, located 80 km from Peterhead, eastern Scotland. Aker Solutions will lead the design of the high-voltage offshore substation (HVAC) and oversee the system design, as well as work on the onshore HV equipment.In September 2024, the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm project, featuring 65 Siemens Gamesa 11 MW turbines, will generate 704 MW of renewable energy-400 MW for Rhode Island and 304 MW for Connecticut-enough to power over 350,000 homes. The project will also involve the installation of two offshore substations, with construction supported by union workers, three Northeast ports, and multiple vessels.In August 2024, GE Vernova, in collaboration with Seatrium, successfully completed the installation of the Offshore Converter Platform (OCP) for RWE's North Sea wind project. The 13,000-tonne platform, equivalent in height to an eleven-story building, was installed using the Sleipnir heavy-lift vessel by Heerema Marine Contractors onto its jacket structure.Growth Forecast Projected:The Global Offshore Substation Market is anticipated to rise at a considerable rate during the forecast period, between 2025 and 2032. In 2023, the market is growing at a steady rate, and with the rising adoption of strategies by key players, the market is expected to rise over the projected horizon.Offshore Substation Cost Structure Analysis in 2024Offshore substation: 2,04,000 US$/MWHVAC electrical system: 61,200 US$/MWAuxiliary systems: 10,200 US$/MWTopside structure: 95,200 US$/MWFoundation: 37,400 US$/MWResearch Process:Both primary and secondary data sources have been used in the global Offshore Substation Market research report.

Here, Bakers Eddy frontman Ciarann Babbington pays homage to New Zealand band Shihad\u2019s fourth studio album \u2018The General Electric\u2019.\n\nIt comes as Aotearoa-raised, Naarm-based rock outfit Bakers Eddy share their new single \u2018Manners Street\u2019, a nostalgic, pop-infused alt rock ode to their hometown of Wellington, New Zealand. You can stream \u2018Manners Street\u2019, and read Babbington\u2019s love letter to Shihad\u2019s \u2018The General Electric\u2019, down below.\n\nBakers Eddy \u2013 \u2018Manners Street\u2019\n\nCiarann Babbington, Baker\u2019s Eddy: The four of us have gone through so many musical phases together. We\u2019ve developed deep obsessions with artists and bands since we were kids. They shape the music we make today, but I think the level of obsession varies slightly between us.\n\nI wanted to pick an album that all of us have an equally strong connection to and one that we all fell in love with together.\n\nIt has to be undoubtedly, deeply embedded into the four of us, one that soundtracked our teenage years, one that led us down the path we walk now.\n\nBakers Eddy the band loves General Electric by Shihad.\n\nActually, Love is an understatement, I think we need General Electric like water.\n\nAfter being away from home for so long now it\u2019s become somewhat of a touchstone for us. When we\u2019ve needed grounding we put on Only Time. When we get homesick, Pacifier. If we feel like we\u2019re drifting, My Mind Sedate, every time without fail brings us back together.\n\nIt\u2019s comparable to what \u201cmum\u2019s casserole\u201d is to some, I think. Except it\u2019s Jon Toogood singing \u201cwe fucked the world just like we\u2019re fucking a donkey\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s been many times on the road where the decision to put on this album has saved us from imploding. There have also been amazing moments when we\u2019ve felt untouchable, on top of the world. Spacing is the song for that. When you get that synergy of song and vibe just right, it\u2019s like crack.\n\nIt took moving to Melbourne and being surrounded by the \u201cMelbourne rock sound\u201d to realise how uniquely Kiwi Shihad\u2019s music is.\n\nAotearoa has a sound, it\u2019s hard to describe. It\u2019s in Crowded House, Fat Freddy\u2019s, anything out of Dunedin in the 90\u2019s. It\u2019s all over the Wellington underground. My friends over here can pick it, but I\u2019m not sure it resonates the same with them as it does for us.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the accent. There\u2019s this dryness to us as people that finds its way into the music we make.\n\nI think that\u2019s why Shihad\u2019s music feels like home to us. It\u2019s because it sounds like home.\n\nGeneral Electric is a reminder of our path, where we started, where we\u2019ve gone. We grew up in the same city as Shihad, we went to the same high school, played the same dive bars. We both moved to Melbourne to see if there was more out there.\n\nThinking back to when I was a kid, hearing this album for the first time, daydreaming about my future, I think it\u2019s pretty cool knowing I did all those things that they did. 11 year old me would be pretty stoked with that.\n\nOur similarities add to the connection the four of us have to Shihad. And as fate would have it, this album is one of the things that keeps us connected.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nShihad Expand Australian Farewell Tour With Full-Album Playthrough Shows\n\nLove Letter To A Record: Captives On Shihad\u2019s \u2018The General Electric\u2019\n\nDozens Of Aussie Artists Impacted As SXSW Gets Officially Cancelled Due To Coronavirus",

            "content": "Portland General Electric ((POR)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nPortland General Electric\u2019s latest earnings call reflected a mixed sentiment, with a blend of strong financial performance and growth in clean energy investments amidst challenges. The company demonstrated impressive financial results, underscored by industrial growth and clean energy advancements. However, concerns over decreased fourth-quarter earnings, power cost volatility, and regulatory challenges also came to light.\n\nStrong Financial Performance in 2024\n\nPortland General Electric reported a robust financial performance for 2024, with GAAP net income reaching $313 million or $3.01 per diluted share. This marks a significant improvement from $228 million or $2.33 per share in 2023, showcasing the company\u2019s ability to enhance its profitability year-over-year.\n\nIncrease in Long-term Customer Growth Expectations\n\nThe company revised its long-term customer growth expectations upwards from 2% to 3%. This positive outlook is largely attributed to the increasing demand from semiconductor manufacturing and data center customers, which are pivotal to the company\u2019s future growth trajectory.\n\nSignificant Investments in Clean Energy\n\nPGE continued to advance its commitment to clean energy, investing over $1.2 billion in capital projects aimed at customer growth, grid resiliency, and decarbonization. In 2024, clean energy constituted 45% of the company\u2019s energy mix, reflecting a substantial step towards sustainability.\n\nIndustrial Growth Driven by High-Tech and Digital Customers\n\nThe company experienced an 11% year-over-year increase in industrial growth, primarily driven by high-tech and digital sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing and data centers. This growth underscores the importance of these sectors in PGE\u2019s expansion plans.\n\nBattery Storage Capacity Expansion\n\nPGE is set to expand its battery storage capacity to over 500 megawatts, which will play a crucial role in enhancing renewable integration, system reliability, and energy price stability. This move highlights the company\u2019s strategy to bolster its energy infrastructure.\n\nDecreased Fourth Quarter Earnings\n\nDespite the overall positive year, PGE\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings saw a decline, with GAAP net income dropping to $39 million or $0.36 per share, compared to $68 million or $0.67 per share in the same quarter of 2023. This decrease poses a concern for the company\u2019s short-term financial health.\n\nChallenges with Power Cost Volatility\n\nPGE faced challenges with power cost volatility, as reflected in the increased costs of $0.68 per share due to unfavorable market conditions in the fourth quarter. While improvements were noted, power cost volatility remains a critical issue for the company.\n\nResidential and Commercial Load Declines\n\nThe company reported declines in residential and commercial loads, with residential load decreasing by 2.8% and commercial load by 2.2% year-over-year. These declines are attributed to advancements in energy efficiency and the adoption of distributed energy resources.\n\nRegulatory Challenges with Rate Case Outcome\n\nPGE encountered regulatory difficulties with the 2025 rate review, which proved less favorable than anticipated. This outcome has implications for the company\u2019s financial planning and strategic direction.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking ahead, Portland General Electric provided guidance for 2025, projecting earnings between $3.13 to $3.33 per diluted share. The company reaffirmed its long-term EPS and dividend growth at 5% to 7%, based on a midpoint of $3.08 per share from the original 2024 guidance. Additionally, PGE plans to focus on significant investments in transmission projects and grid resiliency through 2029, underscoring its commitment to operational efficiency and robust customer demand management.\n\nIn conclusion, Portland General Electric\u2019s earnings call painted a picture of both achievements and hurdles. While the company demonstrated strong financial performance and made notable strides in clean energy and industrial growth, challenges such as decreased fourth-quarter earnings and regulatory hurdles remain. Nevertheless, the forward-looking guidance offers a positive outlook, with strategic investments and growth expectations setting the stage for future success.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "We recently published a list of Why These Dividend Stocks Are Underperforming in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) stands against other dividend stocks that are underperforming in 2025.\n\nConsistent returns from dividend stocks have long attracted many investors, becoming the cornerstone of many investment portfolios. However, significant changes have been recorded a month and a half into 2025 among these dividend stocks. Some of the most historically reliable dividend-paying companies have struggled to maintain attractiveness. As the market concentrates heavily on innovation and growth, the performances of many of the dividend stocks have begun to decline. The list in this article contains significant stocks, some of which may also be in your portfolio.\n\nAre you curious to find out which? Stick around as we count from 10 to 1 and uncover the names falling behind this year.\n\nReasons matter as much as knowing the performance level of stocks. The reallocation of capital is a significant reason for the underperformance. Heavy investments have always favored sectors with high-growth potentials, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and technology space, as of 2025. Funds are being pulled from traditional dividend-paying industries like utilities, consumer staples, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) to invest in these sectors. Though major tech companies have been struggling recently, with the advent of DeepSeek\u2013a Chinese AI model\u2013their anticipated growth trajectories continue to be more than that of many dividend stocks. These changes in the market have consequentially depressed the performance of dividend-heavy sectors.\n\nEven with these yield-wise underperformances, dividend stocks have become more attractive. When funds are pulled to invest in high-growth AI stocks, dividend stocks become undervalued, resulting in higher dividend yields. Investors who prefer consistent income are taking this opportunity to acquire quality dividend stocks at favorable valuations. This trend has provided a balancing effect for some sectors.\n\nAI can be a significant reason for the underperformance of the stocks on our list, but it cannot be the sole reason. In our article, we will also look at other factors that led to the underperformance of these 10 dividend stocks. Interest rates, for instance, are among the vulnerabilities of many dividend-heavy sectors like utilities and REITs. With the Federal Reserve continuing to maintain higher interest rates, the attractiveness of dividend stocks may decline further compared to their income-generating counterparts. On the other hand, many tech giants make dividend payments, closing the gap between high growth and income investing. The entry of more AI-driven companies into the dividend-paying territory might cause some of the existing dividend stocks to lose their footing in the competition.\n\nAs of now, dividend-paying assets hold value for investors seeking stability and income, particularly regarding market volatility. A deflated AI bubble could potentially uplift the performances of dividend stocks in the future. Hence, understanding the factors contributing to their underperformance becomes necessary to make informed decisions about portfolios in 2025. Our list of 10 underperforming dividend stocks and the reasons behind their declining performance would assist in acquiring such understanding.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur list was put together by considering the negative year-to-date (YTD) returns generated by the companies as of February 15, 2025. We have included the stocks with a minimum dividend yield of 3%, which the income-focused investors would find attractive. Part of our selection also involved taking into account only those stocks with an average daily trading volume of more than 1 million units per day and a market capitalization of more than 500 million USD. These criteria helped select the prominent dividend-paying stocks, identified through their financial performance, trading activity, and market size. They put together the following list of 10 underperforming dividend stocks in 2025. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)\n\nDividend yield: 4.80%\n\nDividend payout ratio: 58.21%\n\nEx-Dividend Date: March 24, 2025\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds: 26\n\nA publicly owned energy company, Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR), is an underperforming dividend-payer, with a share price that has declined by 4.54% year-to-date, closing on February 14, 2025.\n\nAfter the closure of the Boardman Coal Plant in 2020, Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) faced changes in its business operations. Boardman Coal Plant was a significant source of power generation for the company. Alternatively, the company started leaning heavily on fossil fuel generation and wholesale spot-market purchases to compensate for the intervals in renewable energy sources. The transition resulted in earnings fluctuations influenced by the changes in fuel costs and market prices.\n\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) may benefit from the AI wave because of the rising electricity demand induced by AI-driven data centers. The demand has the potential to boost the company\u2019s revenues. However, it risks facing environmental regulation issues and congestion costs.\n\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) has a dividend payout ratio of 58.21%. However, its position in the number of hedge fund portfolios has begun to decrease after the third quarter of 2024. Even so, AI-driven data centers may favor the company\u2019s growth. Thus, despite declining share prices, the company maintains a positive outlook among the analysts.\n\nOverall, PORranks 2nd on our list of other dividend stocks that are underperforming in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for POR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than POR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Angus Duncan\n\nDuncan is former chair of the Northwest Conservation and Power Planning Council and former chair of the Oregon Global Warming Commission. He lives in Portland and central Oregon.\n\nA small but important drama is playing out now in a city of Portland land use decision involving power lines, Portland General Electric and five acres of Douglas Fir at the north end of Forest Park.\n\nThat decision links, if indirectly, to the wildfires that exploded in Los Angeles, destroying whole neighborhoods, killing more than two dozen people and causing billions of dollars in damages. It also triggers memories of Oregonians\u2019 own experiences in 2020, when equally ferocious fires burned a million acres of forests and grasslands, killed at least nine people and incinerated whole communities. Only four years later, wildfire acreage almost doubled again.\n\nThis debate over the transmission line through Forest Park has to take place within the wider debate over which is the least imperfect strategy in the existential fight against climate change.\n\nPGE, Oregon\u2019s largest electric utility, is proposing to upgrade its existing power line, in an existing utility right-of-way. To do so, it argues the need to remove some 370 large Douglas fir trees on five acres of Portland\u2019s beloved Forest Park. PGE\u2019s proposal is part of a larger transmission system rebuild across the western U.S. to be more reliable in a world of heightened climate risk, and to carry sufficient clean electricity into and across the greater Portland region.\n\nThe prospect of cutting so many trees has generated significant pushback from neighbors, environmental advocates and the city\u2019s Permitting and Development Office, which is recommending the needed permit be denied.\n\nThe land-use fight obliges us to confront uncomfortable tradeoffs. Carbon from burning fossil fuels in power plants and automobile engines drives climate change. Shifting to zero-carbon wind and solar electricity drives down climate risk \u2013 including the risk of wildfire. Connecting new wind and solar to Portland will require upgraded and new transmission lines across many prairie and forestlands.\n\nWhere we can avoid impacts to community, cultural and natural values, we should. But it is a vexing fact of our climate-altered world that where we can\u2019t, we have to make these tradeoffs.\n\nI\u2019m not writing here to defend PGE\u2019s choices or judgment in siting this transmission link. I\u2019ve spent most of my professional life critiquing utilities for what I thought to be environmentally short-sighted choices. But I think it unlikely that anyone will find a pathway across heavily-settled urban areas that can avoid impacts to parks, roadways, residences , or businesses.\n\nWe should be concerned if we cannot find reasonable ways to make tradeoffs between the trees in Forest Park and the needs of a stronger and cleaner electricity grid. Thoughtful tradeoffs are in the crucial interests of both.\n\nConsider the 370-plus Douglas Firs that would need to make way for this transmission upgrade. While I will lament the loss of those trees, I will lament far more the Doug Fir mortality that Oregon forests will suffer from disease and devastating fires if climate change is not arrested and reversed.\n\nMore insidiously, Oregon State foresters categorize westside Oregon Doug Fir forests at heightened risk from what they term \u201cvapor pressure deficit.\u201d This is when the air becomes warmer and drier, especially in drought conditions but also with normal seasonal rains and saturated soils. The low humidity stresses the tree, weakening resistance to fire, disease and insects.\n\nOur highest forestry priority ought to be preservation of older stands on both sides of the Cascades because they hold huge quantities of carbon and afford ecosystem health for many species. If less valuable tree stands are traded off for faster power system decarbonization \u2013 those are tradeoffs we must be open to, weighing both community values and the need to harden power lines against wildfire. Mitigation actions must be thoughtfully devised.\n\nDigging in against any such tradeoffs is a recipe for preserving a power system dependent on coal and gas, and automobile exhaust from gasoline and diesel fuels. It locks in continued, intensifying climate change.\n\nI urge the city, the defenders of Forest Park and PGE to sit down together to seek solutions that will best protect the full extent of Oregon forests and associated ecosystems from the climate risks that now beset them. This dialogue becomes more critical still if subsequent PGE projects may seek still greater and more intrusive access through Forest Park.\n\nNeither side will win all its points, but a decision that emerges from such reasoned discussion will be a win for our collective future.\n\nSign up for our free Oregon Opinion newsletter.

            "content": "The Gazette offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\n\nShuttered nuclear power plants have never been restarted in the United States, but the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Palo is poised to be among the few that try.\n\nIts owner, NextEra Energy, hopes to finish its restoration of the facility that closed in 2020 in about three years, and resume operation in the final three months of 2028, according to documents it filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nTwo other companies are engaged in similar restart efforts -- in Michigan and Pennsylvania -- and one of them might be online later this year.\n\n\"NextEra is monitoring the progress made by (the other companies) and will make adjustments as appropriate, based on lessons learned from those precedential actions,\" the company said in its regulatory filings.\n\nThe Duane Arnold site, if restarted, would have power output comparable with the smallest commercial nuclear power plant in the country -- a single reactor facility in New York that has a maximum output capacity of 614 megawatts.\n\nDuane Arnold's is 615 megawatts. It is the only such facility in Iowa.\n\nIn an April 8, 2019, photo, a General Electric generator produces electricity from the nuclear-powered steam-driven turbine at the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Palo. The facility closed the next year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)\n\nThere are 54 commercial nuclear power plants in operation in the United States. The largest is in Georgia, with four reactors and a rated capacity of about 4,700 megawatts, or more than seven times the capacity of Duane Arnold.\n\nDuane Arnold's relatively low output -- which makes the plant more expensive to operate per megawatt than others -- combined with the accelerated adoption of wind power in Iowa, led NextEra to start decommissioning the facility in 2020. It ceased operation that August, after that year\u2019s derecho damaged its cooling towers.\n\nThe company has since installed solar arrays at the site, which it will operate for Alliant Energy. The arrays can produce about a third of the total electrical output of the nuclear facility.\n\nThe Duane Arnold Solar Project is seen near Palo on June 10, 2024. The solar arrays can produce about a third of the total electrical output of the nearby nuclear facility when it\u2019s running. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nThe interest in restarting Duane Arnold and other nuclear sites has been spurred by an uptick in the demand for electricity, driven by power-hungry data centers. Two are planned for Cedar Rapids.\n\nThe site has a capacity that is equivalent to about 2 percent of the total electrical generation in Iowa, according to state data.\n\nOther sites\n\nThe Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan is poised to be the first to restart after launching a decommissioning process.\n\nIt is several years older than Duane Arnold -- having started operation in 1971 -- but it has a higher output potential at about 800 megawatts.\n\nIt also started decommissioning later, in 2022. It was purchased by Holtec International, which started the recommissioning process less than a year later.\n\nHoltec has indicated it would expand the site by adding two more reactors over the next decade. It cited strong support from Michigan state officials and the federal government for that decision.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is backing a $1.5 billion loan to the company to restart the plant, and the state of Michigan gave it $300 million in the past two years.\n\nIt's unclear what financial assistance Duane Arnold might receive in Iowa. A spokesperson for the company did not respond to a request to comment for this article.\n\nA Jan. 28 aerial view shows the closed Duane Arnold Energy Center near Palo. Its owner, NextEra Energy, hopes to bring the shuttered plant back online in late 2028. (Nick Rohlman/The Gazette)\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds said last month the potential for nuclear energy in Iowa \"is amazing\" and pledged to create a task force to support it. She noted that luring qualified employees -- such as nuclear engineers -- to Iowa is a potential challenge.\n\nNextEra, in it correspondence with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said it \"has developed a staffing plan that will gradually increase site and fleet staff to support initial inspections, facility renovations, and finally startup and operations.\"\n\nDuane Arnold employed more than 500 people when it was operational. NextEra said its annual payroll was about $85 million.\n\nNextEra has said the facility is in good shape, aside from cooling towers that were damaged by the 2020 derecho. The commission has not yet published recent inspection information about the site.\n\nAn early inspection of the Palisades plant in Michigan identified \"a large number\" of heat transfer tubes that needed further analysis or repair. The fission power plants generate heat to turn water into steam, which drives turbines to create electricity.\n\nThe other nuclear power plant that might restart is in Pennsylvania. It began operation in 1974 -- the same year as Duane Arnold -- and began decommissioning in 2019.\n\nThe Three Mile Island Nuclear Station -- now called the Crane Clean Energy Center -- had a maximum output of 835 megawatts. Its owner started the recommissioning process in November 2024.\n\n\"Preliminary evaluations of key plant equipment have determined that the equipment is in good condition and can be restored without significant modifications,\" its owner, Constellation Energy Corporation, wrote to the commission.\n\nThere was a second reactor at the site that had a partial meltdown in 1979 and was not restarted.\n\nThe commission has created \"restart panels\" of experts to guide the recommissioning processes for each of the three power plants.\n\nComments: (319) 368-8541; jared.strong@thegazette.com",

Based in Norway, Vianode is set to supply synthetic graphite for the production of electric vehicle batteries to be placed in electric cars owned and manufactured by General Motors. These makes include Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC.\n\nThis deal ensures Vianode will supply synthetic graphite to General Motors from 2027 to 2033. In the meantime, Vianode workers are scouting a location for their North American production plant.\n\nThe agreement between General Motors and Vianode will advance battery technology produced in the United States. Currently, China dominates the global supply of graphite.\n\nThis move will benefit the national economy while also financially benefiting individuals interested in owning an electric vehicle. Because of their batteries, these cars are longer-lasting and more energy-efficient than standard fuel-powered vehicles, which in turn saves consumers money.\n\nNot only are they set to become longer-lasting, but electric cars are set to change in price in the coming years. Electric vehicles have been expensive for some time. In 2024, however, producers and consumers saw a 20% price drop in battery prices. Because of this decrease in cost, consumers may see a drop in electric vehicle prices, as well.\n\nThe deal between General Motors and Vianode will benefit everyday consumers and will give an opportunity to eco-conscious buyers to support an eco-friendly company. Vianode's CEO and its employees pride themselves in their dedication to producing synthetic graphite in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.\n\nMaterials like graphite have traditionally emitted high quantities of carbon dioxide, contributing negatively to the world's carbon dioxide footprint. Vianode, however, is a company dedicated to decreasing carbon pollution. According to Vianode, the company has found a way to \"supply material with a 90% decreased carbon dioxide footprint.\"\n\n\"We are proud of and honored that GM has chosen us as a strategic partner,\" Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode, says. \"This underlines Vianode's capability and the way in which we will contribute to shaping the North American battery value chain.\"\n\n\"This agreement with Vianode for the development of artificial graphite is another great example of GM's strategic effort to build a sustainable battery supply chain in North America,\" says Jeff Morrison, senior vice president of Global Purchasing and Supply Chain at General Motors.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

The conference call will be webcast live on the PGE website at investors.portlandgeneral.com. A webcast replay will also be available on PGE's investor website \"Events & Presentations\" page beginning at 2 p.m. ET on February 14, 2025.\n\nMaria Pope, President and CEO; Joe Trpik, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Nick White, Manager of Investor Relations, will participate in the call. Management will respond to questions following formal comments.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted earnings guidance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant items that are generally not related to our ongoing business activities, are infrequent in nature, or both. PGE believes that excluding the effects of these items provides a meaningful representation of the Company's comparative earnings per share and enables investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing operating financial performance. Management utilizes non-GAAP measures to assess the Company's current and forecasted performance, and for communications with shareholders, analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplementary information that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nItems in the periods presented, which PGE believes impact the comparability of comparative earnings and do not represent ongoing operating financial performance, include the following:\n\nNon-deferrable Reliability Contingency Event (RCE) costs resulting from the January 2024 winter storm\n\nwinter storm Boardman revenue requirement settlement charge associated with the year ended 2020, resulting from the OPUC's 2022 GRC Final Order.\n\nDue to the forward-looking nature of PGE's non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance, and the inherently unpredictable nature of items and events which could lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments (such as, but not limited to, regulatory disallowances or extreme weather events), management is unable to estimate the occurrence or value of specific items requiring adjustment for future periods, which could potentially impact the Company's GAAP earnings. Therefore, management cannot provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share guidance to the most comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort. For the same reasons, management is unable to address the probable significance of unavailable information.\n\nPGE's reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are below.\n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Dollars in millions, except EPS) Net Income Diluted EPS GAAP as reported for the year ended December 31, 2024 $ 313 $ 3.01 Exclusion of January 2024 storm costs 19 0.18 Tax effect (1) (5) (0.05) Non-GAAP as reported for the year ended December 31, 2024 $ 327 $ 3.14\n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions, except EPS) Net Income Diluted EPS GAAP as reported for the year ended December 31, 2023 $ 228 $ 2.33 Exclusion of Boardman revenue requirement settlement charge 7 0.07 Tax effect (1) (2) (0.02) Non-GAAP as reported for the year ended December 31, 2023 $ 233 $ 2.38\n\n\n\n(1) Tax effects were determined based on the Company's full-year blended federal and state statutory rate.\n\nAbout Portland General Electric Company\n\nPortland General Electric (NYSE: POR) is an integrated energy company that generates, transmits and distributes electricity to over 950,000 customers serving an area of 1.9 million Oregonians.

These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other factors.\n\nForward-looking statements include statements regarding the Company's full-year earnings guidance (including assumptions and expectations regarding annual retail deliveries, average hydro conditions, wind generation, normal thermal plant operations, operating and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization expense) as well as other statements containing words such as \"anticipates,\" \"assumptions,\" \"based on,\" \"believes,\" \"conditioned upon,\" \"considers,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"expected,\" \"forecast,\" \"goals,\" \"intends,\" \"needs,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"promises,\" \"seeks,\" \"should,\" \"subject to,\" \"targets,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" or similar expressions.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the timing or outcome of various legal and regulatory actions; governmental policies, legislative action, and regulatory audits, investigations and actions with respect to allowed rates of return, financings, electricity pricing and price structures, acquisition and disposal of facilities and other assets, construction and operation of plant facilities, transmission of electricity, recovery of power costs, operating expenses, deferrals, timely recovery of costs, and capital investments, energy trading activities, and current or prospective wholesale and retail competition; changing customer expectations and choices that may reduce demand for electricity; the sale of excess energy during periods of low demand or low wholesale market prices; impaired financial stability of vendors and service providers and elevated levels of uncollectible customer accounts; uncertainties associated with energy demand to new data centers, including the concentration of data centers, and the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, environmental, and other permits to construct new facilities in a timely manner; operational risks relating to the Company's generation and battery storage facilities, including hydro conditions, wind conditions, disruption of transmission and distribution, disruption of fuel supply, and unscheduled plant outages, which may result in unanticipated operating, maintenance and repair costs, as well as replacement power costs; delays in the supply chain and increased supply costs (including application of tariffs), failure to complete capital projects on schedule or within budget, failure of counterparties to perform under agreement, or the abandonment of capital projects, which could result in the Company's inability to recover project costs, or impact our competitive position, market share, revenues and project margins in material ways; default or nonperformance of counterparties from whom PGE purchases capacity or energy, which require the purchase of replacement power and renewable attributes at increased costs; complications arising from PGE's jointly-owned plant, including ownership changes, regulatory outcomes or operational failures; changes in, and compliance with, environmental laws and policies, including those related to threatened and endangered species, fish, and wildfire; future laws, regulations, and proceedings that could increase the Company's costs of operating its thermal generating plants, or affect the operations of such plants by imposing requirements for additional emissions controls or significant emissions fees or taxes, particularly with respect to coal-fired generating facilities, in order to mitigate carbon dioxide, mercury, and other gas emissions; volatility in wholesale power and natural gas prices that could require PGE to post additional collateral or issue additional letters of credit pursuant to power and natural gas purchase agreements; changes in the availability and price of wholesale power and fuels; changes in customer growth, or demographic patterns, including changes in load resulting in future transmission constraints, in PGE's service territory; changes in capital and credit market conditions, including volatility of equity markets as well as changes in PGE's credit ratings and outlook on such credit ratings, reductions in demand for investment-grade commercial paper or interest rates, which could affect the access to and availability or cost of capital and result in delay or cancellation of capital projects or execution of the Company's strategic plan as currently envisioned; inflation and volatility in interest rates; the effects of climate change, whether global or local in nature; unseasonable or severe weather conditions, wildfires, and other natural phenomena and natural disasters that could result in operational disruptions, unanticipated restoration costs, third party liability or that may affect energy costs or consumption; the effectiveness of PGE's risk management policies and procedures; ignitions caused by PGE assets or PGE's ability to effectively implement a Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) and de-energize its system in the event of heightened wildfire risk or implement effective system hardening programs; cybersecurity attacks, data security breaches, physical attacks and security breaches, or other malicious acts against the Company or against Company vendors, which could disrupt operations, require significant expenditures, or result in the release of confidential customer, vendor, employee, or Company information; employee workforce factors, including potential strikes, work stoppages, transitions in senior management, and the ability to recruit and retain key employees and other talent and turnover due to macroeconomic trends or if efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion are perceived to be insufficient or overdone; widespread health emergencies or outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; failure to achieve the Company's greenhouse gas emission goals or being perceived to have either failed to act responsibly with respect to the environment or effectively responded to legislative requirements concerning greenhouse gas emission reductions; social attitudes regarding the electric utility and power industries; political and economic conditions; acts of war or terrorism; changes in financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by governing bodies; new federal, state, and local laws that could have adverse effects on operating results; and risks and uncertainties related to generation and transmission projects, including, but not limited to, regulatory processes, transmission capabilities, system interconnections, permitting and construction delays, legislative uncertainty, inflationary impacts, supply costs and supply chain constraints. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\n\nRisks and uncertainties to which the Company are subject are further discussed in the reports that the Company has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are available through the EDGAR system free-of-charge on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov and on the Company's website, investors.portlandgeneral.com.

            "content": "GE is a multi-national conglomerate that was originally incorporated in 1892. The company was founded by Thomas Edison as the Edison General Electric Company and shortened its name to General Electric following a merger with two other early electric pioneers. The name was later shortened again to GE. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but has operations on a global scale. One of the original 12 Dow stocks, the company was a component of the index for 122 years until its ousting in 2018.\n\nOriginally intended to make and market Edison\u2019s incandescent lamp and following products, the company grew over the years through mergers, acquisitions, and natural expansion into newly created fields. Among the many early accomplishments is the creation of RCA and NBC which will both become forces of their own. Other major innovations include the world\u2019s first turbine superchargers, industrial gas turbine engines, and the first jet engine. In the field of computing, General Electric Company is credited as being one of the 8 major computer companies of the 1960s and shares responsibility for today\u2019s digital world. In regard to its employees, two were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work with the company.\n\nToday GE operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates through four segments including Power, Renewables, Aerospace, and Healthcare although there are plans in the works to split the company into three separate entities. The three new companies would be GE Vernova (power and renewables), GE Health, and GE Aerospace. The spin-offs are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nThe Power segment offers a variety of turbine engines for power production as well as the full range of services from plant construction to retrofit and refit. The Renewables segment is focused on solutions for renewable energy including wind and hydro and the technology to operate them. The Aviation segment manufactures aircraft engines of all varieties and the Healthcare segment offers technology for imaging, monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery to health and medical facilities.\n\nGeneral Electric is committed to helping the world transition to a greener way of life and is exiting the new-build coal-fired power industry. Instead, its advancements in wind, grid efficiency, and natural gas are being deployed around the world helping to reduce emissions and generate cleaner energy for businesses, industry, and communities. The company is targeting 2030 for its own carbon neutrality and 2050 for net zero emissions.",

            "content": "Erin Therese Graffy de Garcia, Santa Barbara\u2019s \u201cSociety Lady,\u201d passed away early in the morning on January 21, 2025, from ovarian cancer.\n\nErin was an entertainer, publisher, researcher, dancer, singer, writer, historian, smuggler, advisor, teacher, wife, sister, daughter, entrepreneur, speaker, auctioneer, fundraiser and fun-raiser, and had the best hat for any occasion.\n\nFar from her warm, sunny town of Santa Barbara, Erin was born on a 15-degree snowy day on a February 24 in Wichita, Kansas. As for the birth year, Erin would simply tell you, \u201cIt was a good one.\u201d (She never divulged her age.)\n\nWelcoming Erin into the world were her parents, Charles and Jeanne Graffy, and her brothers, Kurt and Neal. Not long after her birth, her father, a test pilot for Boeing Aircraft Co., was hired by General Electric and the family moved to Scotia, New York, where the next sibling, Colleen, was born. A top-secret testing program with General Electric resulted in the family relocating to Santa Barbara where the fifth child, Kerry, was later born. It was during the Graffys\u2019 first summer in Santa Barbara that Erin discovered Fiesta. As a member of Mrs. Liam O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Children\u2019s Strolling Chorus, she learned and sang the Spanish songs of old California and wore her first Fiesta dress. The songs, dances, and pageantry would soon become part of her DNA.\n\nErin\u2019s education began at Marymount School, then an all-girls institution. When Marymount closed its high school, she completed her senior year at Santa Barbara High School. During these years, Erin studied dance with Jose Manero, took voice training from Mrs. Lura Dolas, and dove into Youth Theater Productions with Director Jack Nakano.\n\nHer outstanding singing awarded her a full scholarship to Pepperdine University \u2014 the first voice scholarship given. She next entered Occidental College for a program in orchestra conducting and then returned to Pepperdine for a master\u2019s in marketing and communications, graduating magna cum laude.\n\nDuring her time at Pepperdine, she had the opportunity to visit Russia. Taking advantage of that circumstance, she smuggled Bibles, leaving them with Christians she met or dropping them in interesting locations. Erin figured, \u201cIf a non-Christian found it, they\u2019ll sell it on the black market. So, one way or the other, it will get into the right hands.\u201d Many years later, emboldened by that successful contraband run, she left Ireland and entered the U.S. with several undocumented salmon. That\u2019s all you need to know.\n\nIn 1986, she founded Erin Graffy Associates, a marketing communications consultancy. Through her seminars, workshops, and personal consultations, she worked with more than 1,200 local and international businesses.\n\nErin wrote more than 100 books and articles on regional history and culture, including the popular How to Santa Barbara series; Saint Barbara: The Truth, Tales, Tidbits & Trivia of Santa Barbara\u2019s Patron Saint; Remembering Jordanos; and a coffee-table book on the Santa Barbara Yacht Club. She reviewed for the California Historical Society, served for 10 years as editor of La Gazeta for the Mission Archive Library, and lectured extensively on California\u2019s Rancho Period. Her book Old Spanish Days: Santa Barbara History Through Public Art was the recipient of three national book awards. As a Southern California historian, she was featured in several documentaries, including the Emmy Award\u2013winning documentary Impressions in Time, and was featured as a California historian in the 2015 Pasadena Rose Parade.\n\nAs part of her literary endeavors, she started her own publishing company, Kieran Publishing, where she advised, co-wrote, and ghost-wrote with a number of authors to get their dream books completed and printed.\n\nTurning to her own half-Irish family history, she worked to promote Dingle, Ireland, as a Sister City of Santa Barbara. Sensing a bit of reluctance from City Council members, in true Erin fashion, she brought the Dingle delegation \u2014 including several charming little red-haired Irish dancers \u2014 into the Council chambers to give it their all. After that, the Council simply could not say no in front of the little lasses.\n\nOzzie Da Ros, noted local Italian stonemason, had long proclaimed that the surname \u201cGraffy\u201d was not German, but Italian. Perhaps this is what led Erin to research and publish the history of Santa Barbara\u2019s early Italian immigrants, resulting in the Italian American Boot Club bestowing Erin with honorary membership.\n\nErin truly loved three things: dancing; her husband, Jim; and chocolate. Of all the multitude of things Erin was involved in, she loved dancing the most. And it was dancing that introduced her to the smooth steps of Dr. James Paul Garcia. They met at a dance at the Bank of Montecito and a spark was ignited. All it took was one more chance meeting, and they danced together for the next 35 years.\n\nErin\u2019s passion for singing, dancing, and history fueled her contributions to Old Spanish Days, where she served as an advisor, Board of Directors member, and Official Fiesta Historian. With her husband, Jim, she created Flor y Canto Californio, a special show for Fiesta at the Courthouse with live musicians, singers, and dancers performing, as Erin would say, \u201cThe Greatest Hits of 1836.\u201d Erin provided historical narration to explain the customs and traditions of that Rancho era, the roots of Old Spanish Days.\n\nErin\u2019s Society Lady column was a must-read in the TKSanta Barbara News-Press, covering the who\u2019s who of local organizations and their events. Her columns were also in the Montecito Journal, the Santa Barbara Independent, and Noozhawk. Erin was a sought-after emcee and auctioneer, often handling those roles in addition to covering the event. Erin was also in great demand for her ability to parody songs for tributes and roasts of Santa Barbara locals. She was known for her gracious introductions, especially for newcomers to the community.\n\nAlong with former Sheriff Jim Thomas, Erin launched the Sheriff\u2019s Council, which has raised millions of dollars for much-needed equipment for local law enforcement. She was instrumental in raising $5 million to establish the Father Virgil Cordano Chair in Catholic Studies at UCSB. In 2017, Erin and her husband, Jim, were honored as Community Stars for their work and devotion to the Santa Barbara community by Catholic Charities at their Mistletoe Ball.\n\nErin eschewed coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol. However, there was chocolate. Her love for chocolate was so widely known that no matter the occasion, the venue, or what was stated on the menu, when it came to that certain delicacy following dinner, the hosts and staff ensured that Erin somehow would get chocolate. As she explained, \u201cIf it\u2019s not chocolate, it\u2019s not dessert.\u201d\n\nThe Independent\u2019s Nick Welsh summed up the loss to the community: \u201cErin was such a force of nature, delight, wit, caring, and smarts that it is impossible to imagine her not being here. Santa Barbara will be a duller, stupider, flatter place. Its fun IQ just dropped one billion points.\u201d\n\nErin is survived by her husband, Dr. Jim Garcia; her brothers, Kurt (Cathay) and Neal (Veronica); sisters, Colleen and Kerry Mariea (Fred); and nieces and nephews, Colette, Colin, Kyle, Kirsten, Sarah, Olivia, and Spencer. She is predeceased by her father, Charles R. Graffy, and her mother, Jeanne Graffy, former Santa Barbara City Councilmember and County Supervisor.\n\nA Memorial Mass will be held at the Old Mission Santa Barbara at 2 p.m., Friday, February 28, followed by a reception, \u201cThe Erin Graffy Chocolate Finale,\u201d at Rockwood, the Santa Barbara Woman\u2019s Club.\n\nIn lieu of flowers or chocolate, the Erin Graffy de Garcia Legacy Endowment has been established to ensure that Santa Barbara is not a \u201cduller, stupider, flatter place\u201d by promoting all things Santa Barbara, including, dance, music, history, and Fiesta in association with the Profant Foundation. Zelle contributions can be made via eringraffylegacy@gmail.com. Those interested in being part of the Founders\u2019 Circle may email Colleen Graffy at the same address.",

Raising their three boys in this home, having many family gatherings, holidays and even leaving their door unlocked for others on the occasion that a friend of their sons may need a couch to sleep on. Dick and Barbara welcomed all into their home and showed pride in it.\n\n\n\nDick worked very hard at GE and put in many hours while Barbara was busy taking care of their boys at home. When the boys got older he always made sure to be at a soccer game or a school event by adjusting his schedule. His family was his world and he never wanted to miss anything that was important.\n\n\n\nAfter Dicks retirement, his greatest days were ahead. Dick became a grandfather and earned the title Papi for all the kids that followed. Papi\u2019s grandkids were the joy of his life. Him and Barbara devoted any time that they could to visiting with their grandkids or babysitting when needed . As the kids got older they never missed a sporting/dance/school event or anything special that they could be a part of. Papi remained a constant in his grandkids life even after the passing of his wife Barbara.\n\n\n\nDick will always be remembered for his sense of humor, the strength that he showed in his later years dealing with his disabilities, and the dedication he showed for his family.\n\n\n\nRichard is preceded in death by his parents, Clarence and Barbara Trogler; his brother, Melvin; and Barbara Trogler (Goulart), his beloved wife of 48 years.\n\n\n\nRichard is survived by his 3 sons, Michael, Marc and Stephen; Daughters-in-law, Jennifer and Kristen; along with his Grandchildren, Andrew, Ashley, Madison, Jacob, Caitlin and Adelaide.\n\n\n\nRespecting Richard's wishes, his children and their families will be doing a private ceremony at a later date.\n\n\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to stjude.org\n\n",

This would have material impacts on the industry, putting some projects at risk due to economic factors.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. wind industry is heavily dependent on imports, particularly for components like blades, drivetrains and electrical systems. In 2023, wind-related equipment imports to the United States were valued at $1.7 billion, with 41% coming from Mexico, Canada and China.\n\n\u201cTariffs are not an unprecedented condition for the wind industry,\u201d said Lico. \u201cWind peers await the specialization of the tariff legislation to fully assess the impact. Tariffs imposed during the previous Trump\u2019s term had minimal impact on the U.S. wind power segment, while a looser monetary policy may soften tariffs\u2019 impact.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the proposed tariffs will have an incremental impact on U.S. onshore wind power economics, increasing levelized cost of energy (LCOE) by 4% in the near term. In the scenario of universal 25% tariffs, LCOE will rise by 7%.\n\n\u201cThe supply chain actors are waiting for the dust to settle, exploring their options,\u201d said Lico. \u201cWe anticipate that wind manufacturers will adopt a mix of measures to mitigate tariffs\u2019 impact, including rerouting and restructuring their supply chains and assembly lines, strengthening US localization, and increasing their prices.\u201d\n\nNews item from WoodMac",

            "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could set the seal on key defense orders for General Dynamics (GD) and General Electric (GE) this week as he heads to Washington for a two-day U.S. visit.\n\nModi, keen to avert a trade war with the U.S., joins President Donald Trump on Wednesday after heading to France, and defense deals are likely to form part of discussions on trade, security and energy.\n\nTrump Wants More Defense Deals\n\nTrump urged Modi last month to buy more U.S. defense equipment and move \u201ctoward a fair trading relationship.\u201d India, which is the world\u2019s largest importer of arms, has traditionally relied on Russia for defense equipment.\n\nIt\u2019s understood that key contracts relating to GD\u2019s Stryker combat vehicles and GE\u2019s aerospace business will be discussed, according to Reuters.\n\nIndia and the U.S. have been in protracted talks over joint production of the Stryker vehicles, with India expected to become the first foreign country to produce the vehicles, while executives from the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) are due to finalize a deal over co-production of General Electric\u2019s F414 jet engines.\n\nThe Stryker, a family of eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicles, was demonstrated to the Indian Army last year and officials quickly worked out a plan to purchase several hundred from manufacturer GD.\n\nMeanwhile the GE deal was first struck in 2023, with officials hoping it to be finalized by March. GE Aerospace\u2019s F414 engines are be co-produced in India to power the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft Mk2.\n\n\u201cI look forward to meeting my friend, President Trump,\u201d Modi said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThis visit will be an opportunity to build upon the successes of our collaboration in his first term and develop an agenda to further elevate and deepen our partnership, including in the areas of technology, trade, defence, energy, and supply chain resilience.\u201d\n\nIs GD a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on GD, based on eight Buys, nine Holds and one Sell. The average GD price target of $299.00 implies 17% upside from current levels after the stock rose 30% in the last three years.\n\nSee more GD analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Last month, Trump asked Modi, who heads to Washington on Wednesday for a two-day visit, to buy more U.S.-made security equipment and move \"toward a fair trading relationship\".\n\n\"I look forward to meeting my friend, President Trump,\" Modi said in a statement on Monday before leaving for France and the United States.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This visit will be an opportunity to build upon the successes of our collaboration in his first term and develop an agenda to further elevate and deepen our partnership, including in the areas of technology, trade, defence, energy, and supply chain resilience.\"\n\nModi is preparing additional tariff cuts ahead of his meeting with Trump that could boost American exports to India and avoid a potential trade war, government officials said.\n\nIndia and the United States have been in protracted talks over the co-production of Stryker combat vehicles made by General Dynamics and also used by the U.S. Army.\n\nThey are also working to wrap up contract talks on co-production of fighter jet engines in India for the Indian Air Force, a deal agreed in 2023, said two sources who sought anonymity as they were not authorised to tall to the media.\n\n\"We certainly wish to expedite the transaction which we would like to have with the United States,\" Defence Production Secretary Sanjeev Kumar told reporters on Sunday, adding that such efforts were underway. But he did not elaborate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOfficials of India's state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) are set to meet in coming weeks with U.S. officials and the aerospace unit of General Electric, maker of GE-414 engines, for talks to finalise the deal by March, the sources said.\n\nGE, HAL, General Dynamics, the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and Indian defence and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNew Delhi has started talks with the Trump administration on a plan to buy Stryker vehicles after they were demonstrated late last year for the Indian Army, two other sources said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe plan envisages that India will acquire a few hundred Strykers with a mounted anti-tank guided missile system, they added, and later co-produce them through a state-run firm, the sources said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the two potential deals would feature in talks between Modi and Trump, whose warning on Sunday that he would introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the United States could also hurt Indian companies.\n\n(Reporting by Shivam Patel in New Delhi; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Michael Perry)",

However, ongoing delays in the aircraft\u2019s development have forced the Dubai-based airline to reconsider its strategy. According to Bloomberg, the first deliveries are now postponed until at least the second quarter of 2027 and may even stretch into 2028. These delays follow a series of missed deadlines and significant challenges in the aircraft\u2019s production.\n\nChallenges in the 777X Program\n\nInitially set for delivery in 2020, the Boeing 777X was designed to redefine the 777 series with advancements in fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort. Unfortunately, production and certification hurdles have plagued the program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has intensified scrutiny of Boeing\u2019s certification processes following safety concerns tied to earlier models, further complicating the timeline.\n\nEmirates Adjusts Its Fleet Strategy\n\nAs a long-time flagship customer of the 777X, Emirates has faced mounting operational challenges due to these delays. Last November, Emirates\u2019 President Sir Tim Clark openly expressed the airline\u2019s frustrations, emphasizing the need for new aircraft to sustain operations.\n\nThe delays have forced Emirates to overhaul its plans, including scrapping its original 777X interior design, which became outdated due to advancements in cabin technology. To bridge the gap, Emirates has committed $4 billion to a refurbishment program, upgrading its existing Airbus A380 and earlier Boeing 777 fleets. These investments aim to maintain service standards while awaiting the arrival of the delayed aircraft.\n\nLufthansa to Lead 777X Launch\n\nDespite similar challenges, Lufthansa is set to become the launch customer for the Boeing 777-9, the flagship model in the 777X family. During Boeing\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO Brian West confirmed that Lufthansa would receive the first delivery in 2026. Meanwhile, other airlines, including Qatar Airways, which has 90 777X aircraft on order, face comparable setbacks.\n\nGlobal Orders for the Boeing 777X\n\nThe table below highlights some of the major orders for the Boeing 777X: Airline Country Region Aircraft Model Engine Manufacturer Pending Orders Lufthansa Group Germany Europe Boeing 777X General Electric 27 Ethiopian Airlines Ethiopia Africa Boeing 777X General Electric 8 ANA (All Nippon Airways) Japan East Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 17 Emirates Airlines United Arab Emirates Middle East Boeing 777X General Electric 205 British Airways United Kingdom Europe Boeing 777X General Electric 18 Silk Way Airlines Azerbaijan Central Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 2 Cargolux Luxembourg Europe Boeing 777X General Electric 10 Qatar Airways Qatar Middle East Boeing 777X General Electric 94 ANA Holdings Japan East Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 1 Unspecified Customers Unknown Unknown Boeing 777X General Electric 12 Singapore Airlines Singapore Southeast Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 31 Air India India South Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 10 Etihad Airways United Arab Emirates Middle East Boeing 777X General Electric 25 Cathay Pacific Hong Kong East Asia Boeing 777X General Electric 21\n\nWhile Emirates has had to adapt its operations, it remains committed to the Boeing 777X as a key element of its future fleet. However, the road ahead is marked by uncertainty as the aircraft\u2019s debut faces continuous setbacks.\n\nShare On:",

            "content": "Predict breakdown and dangerous operating conditions\n\n\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of the IIoT is how it can dramatically improve operating efficiencies. If a machine goes down, for example, connected sensors can automatically pinpoint where the issue is occurring and trigger a service request. Perhaps more importantly, IIoT can also help a manufacturer predict when a machine will likely breakdown or enter a dangerous operating condition before it ever happens.\n\n\n\n\u201cPredictive maintenance is a big thing,\u201d says Schmid. \u201cThis lets us limit equipment downtime and improve safety by being proactive about a fix.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe sensors work by analyzing the sound frequencies, vibrations, and temperature of a given machine to tell if it\u2019s working within its normal condition. This process\u2014known as condition monitoring\u2014is time intensive when humans do it manually. By using sensors to collect and quickly analyze data points in the cloud, prediction becomes easier.\n\n\n\nSchmid cites a client that makes packaging materials as a great use case for the prediction capability of connected sensors. When the company outfitted its production equipment with IIoT sensors, overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) improved by 9%. The heightened OEE decreased waste for the company by predicting when machines would need to be maintained before they failed and had to be taken out of service. By decreasing machine downtime, Schmid says the company was able to take better advantage of the factory\u2019s capacity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks to the predictive nature of the sensors, the company avoided building another production line, which helped them save $25 million in added capital expenditures,\u201d he says.",

            "content": "Portland General Electric (POR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 14, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $716.17 million, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.91% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

I\u2019m humbled to have participated in a relatively short but impactful chapter of General Electric\u2019s 130+ year history which serves as an inspiration to me today. The legacy of Edison\u2019s original innovation is found in the global power system built over the last century where 25% of the world\u2019s electricity is generated through our equipment. Leveraging that legacy, today we offer our customers advanced technology and services to meet the growing demands on our power system.\n\n\n\nWith the creation of GE Vernova, we have launched a purpose-built innovation company focused on what the world needs for today and tomorrow: a new company dedicated to electrifying and decarbonizing the energy system and providing the essential infrastructure needed for a prosperous and sustainable future.\n\n\n\nWe approach our role with an enormous sense of responsibility, knowing the world relies on us for the equipment, services, and software to produce and distribute the electricity it needs. By nurturing today\u2019s state-of-the-art technologies, while investing in innovation, cutting-edge manufacturing, and lean, we see a clear pathway to grow electrical supply while addressing climate change.\n\n\n\nI enter this new year feeling more optimistic than ever about GE Vernova, our industry, and the task ahead of us.

Administrative officials confirm that Trent Buxton resigned on Feb. 4.\n\nCurrent BECi General Manager Mike Viator said the board voted to appoint Dan O\u2019Dell to fill the remainder of Buxton\u2019s term. Since O\u2019Dell had qualified to run for the seat and is unopposed, Viator says O\u2019Dell will begin a full term in March.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Buxton resigned. He has not returned our call. Also, BECi is in the middle of seeking a rate increase.\n\nThe former general manager, Brian Zelenak, has signed up to formally participate in the rate hearing before the Louisiana Public Service Commission.\n\nPrevious coverage:\n\nZelenak is an \u201cintervenor\u201d which makes him an official party in the legal proceedings. He said he\u2019s participating because of his commitment to look out for members of the co-op and their electric bills.\n\n\u201cMy goal in bringing these allegations forward was to reform BECi so that it would be a strong financial co-op that would support families in the community of DeRidder for years to come. I continue to have that as my goal and I will continue to use every avenue that I have to reach that goal,\u201d Zelenak said.\n\nIn a letter to the PSC, Zelenak says, as a former general manager, he knows of many opportunities for cost savings at the co-op that could help lower BECi\u2019s electric rates and increase BECi\u2019s reliability. However, he says they have not been pursued.\n\nZelenak also has filed a lawsuit against the board saying he was fired for being a whistle-blower and exposing multiple wrongdoings, theft, and violations of IRS regulations.\n\nThe rate increase application and related documents can be viewed HERE.\n\nLate this afternoon, we found out our questions were referred to attorneys for BECi. We will let you know if they send a response. Earlier, when Zelenak filed the lawsuit, an attorney for BECi responded saying, he was fired for valid reasons.\n\nCopyright 2025 KPLC.

            "content": "GE Vernova today released its first annual report since becoming an independent company, detailing how 2024 was a foundational year as the company positions itself to serve in an unprecedented era of electric growth. With 75,000 employees around the globe, the company\u2019s technology helps generate approximately 25% of the world\u2019s electricity. Given its broad portfolio of energy solutions across power, wind, and electrification technologies, GE Vernova is uniquely positioned to lead a new era of energy \u2014 delivering on its mission to electrify the world while simultaneously working to decarbonize it.\n\n\u201cWe approach our role with an enormous sense of responsibility, knowing the world relies on us for the equipment, services, and software to produce and distribute the electricity it needs,\u201d writes Chief Executive Officer Scott Strazik in his first letter to stockholders that kicks off the report. \u201cBy nurturing today\u2019s state-of-the-art technologies, while investing in innovation, cutting-edge manufacturing, and lean, we see a clear pathway to grow electrical supply while addressing climate change.\u201d\n\nThe year 2024 marked a strong start for the new company\u2019s financial performance. Orders came in at $44 billion, with revenue of $35 billion, and all segments delivered margin expansion. Power delivered solid growth and margin expansion, led by Gas Power, and the company expects demand in this segment to remain strong heading into 2025. In Wind, GE Vernova delivered solid progress on its turnaround. Lastly, Electrification, GE Vernova\u2019s fastest-growing segment, experienced significant orders and backlog growth as customers increased their grid investments.\n\n\u201cI enter this new year feeling more optimistic than ever about GE Vernova, our industry, and the task ahead of us,\u201d writes CEO Scott Strazik in the GE Vernova Annual Report. Top: GE Vernova\u2019s leadership team at the 2024 Founders Meeting in Greenville, South Carolina. Images credit: GE Vernova\n\nIn 2024, GE Vernova also added to its backlog, supported by growing global demand for electric power. \u201cWe grew our already healthy backlog to $119 billion while also expanding margins in backlog, which will fuel profitable growth well into the future,\u201d Strazik writes in his letter. \u201cIn December, we raised our multi-year financial outlook and launched our capital allocation framework, including a shareholder return commitment with our first dividend and share repurchase authorization. We are well-positioned to create value for our stakeholders in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nA New Era\n\nThe annual report outlines the unprecedented era of electric growth ahead and how GE Vernova is delivering its industry transformation.

We need to get the most out of our electric power system by growing and transforming today\u2019s aging existing infrastructure.\u201d At the same time, he says the world needs to prioritize investment into scalable, power-dense \u201cworkhorse\u201d products.\n\nThe backbone of the electric power system is the grid, and grid investments are projected to double by 2030. \u201cThis is our sweet spot,\u201d Strazik says, as more than 95% of power transmission utilities in the world are equipped with components from GE Vernova\u2019s electrification systems. Heating, transport, and industrialism are all in the process of migrating to the grid, albeit at different speeds. GE Vernova brings a number of solutions to this growth, not least of which is sophisticated grid software that optimizes efficiency for customers. The company also offers upgrade solutions for its installed base of gas turbines, nuclear units, and hydropower plants, and through wind repowering.\n\nThe Work Ahead\n\nWith nearly a year as a standalone company under its belt, GE Vernova sees five top priorities for 2025: continuing to accelerate the GE Vernova culture; scaling for significant growth in Gas Power and Grid Solutions; delivering the Wind turnaround; positioning Nuclear and Electrification Software to play a meaningful role; and sustaining the company\u2019s discipline in managing cash and cost structure. The company culture is always open to ideas both from within and from the outside world of government, academia, and start-ups, and foundational to this culture are safety, quality, delivery, and cost (SQDC), the true north that ties together all of GE Vernova\u2019s aspirations.\n\nNuclear professionals train at a replica of a boiling water reactor in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nGE Vernova is investing heavily in its own operations, announcing just last month that it will devote nearly $600 million over two years, mainly in Gas Power but also across Grid, Wind, Nuclear, and its Advanced Research Center (ARC), the productive lab where GE Vernova churns out tech innovations. As part of its Wind turnaround, the company is preparing for an inflection point in Onshore Wind, after a tough year for global offshore wind. Seeking to capitalize on the renewed interest in nuclear power, driven by higher demand from data centers, GE Vernova intends to strengthen its supply chain in 2025 as it remains on schedule to see its first 300-megawatt small modular reactor (SMR) commissioned in Ontario, in 2029.\n\nAccording to Strazik, the best is yet to come. \u201c2025 will be an exciting year for GE Vernova and our industry. There are abundant opportunities for our company to help meet the surging global demand for electric power with our equipment, services, and software. We will partner with our customers and the wider energy ecosystem to shape and deliver the future energy system, one that provides abundant, resilient, and sustainable energy for everyone.\u201d\n\nPlease click here to read GE Vernova\u2019s 2024 Annual Report.\n\nThis document contains forward-looking statements.

The company was founded by Thomas Edison as the Edison General Electric Company and shortened its name to General Electric following a merger with two other early electric pioneers. The name was later shortened again to GE. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but has operations on a global scale. One of the original 12 Dow stocks, the company was a component of the index for 122 years until its ousting in 2018.\n\nOriginally intended to make and market Edison\u2019s incandescent lamp and following products, the company grew over the years through mergers, acquisitions, and natural expansion into newly created fields. Among the many early accomplishments is the creation of RCA and NBC which will both become forces of their own. Other major innovations include the world\u2019s first turbine superchargers, industrial gas turbine engines, and the first jet engine. In the field of computing, General Electric Company is credited as being one of the 8 major computer companies of the 1960s and shares responsibility for today\u2019s digital world. In regard to its employees, two were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work with the company.\n\nToday GE operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates through four segments including Power, Renewables, Aerospace, and Healthcare although there are plans in the works to split the company into three separate entities. The three new companies would be GE Vernova (power and renewables), GE Health, and GE Aerospace. The spin-offs are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nThe Power segment offers a variety of turbine engines for power production as well as the full range of services from plant construction to retrofit and refit. The Renewables segment is focused on solutions for renewable energy including wind and hydro and the technology to operate them. The Aviation segment manufactures aircraft engines of all varieties and the Healthcare segment offers technology for imaging, monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery to health and medical facilities.\n\nGeneral Electric is committed to helping the world transition to a greener way of life and is exiting the new-build coal-fired power industry. Instead, its advancements in wind, grid efficiency, and natural gas are being deployed around the world helping to reduce emissions and generate cleaner energy for businesses, industry, and communities. The company is targeting 2030 for its own carbon neutrality and 2050 for net zero emissions.",

Here are some of the items affected by proposed tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's move to impose or threaten massive tariffs against China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union affect about $2 trillion worth of U.S. imports and have the potential to disrupt business for major Cincinnati companies that rely on foreign goods or that sell goods overseas.\n\nHigher prices at Kroger?\n\nAttention supermarket shoppers: Higher prices could be headed your way soon.\n\nThe $93 billion worth of imported food products from Mexico, Canada, China and the European Union that Americans buy each year is just a fraction of the imports from those countries and trade partners, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative. But because they are perishable and used quickly after purchase, they are where American consumers could see the impact of a trade war first.\n\nWhat are some of the products that could be affected? America imports nearly $20 billion of fresh fruit and vegetables from Mexico. Americans also drink $5.7 billion in Mexican beer and $4.7 billion in liquor from south of the border, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nFrom Canada, America imports $6 billion worth of cereal, baked goods and pasta, $5 billion of vegetable oils, $3.6 billion in seafood and $3 billion in beef.\n\nAmerica imports $1.5 billion of seafood from China. And from Europe, it imports $5.4 billion in wine, $5 billion in liquor and $3 billion in dairy products.\n\nKroger officials declined to comment.\n\nPossibly 'magnified' disruption in foreign markets for GE Aerospace\n\nCincinnati\u2019s newly-minted standalone Fortune 500, long an Evendale-based subsidiary of the now-dismantled Boston conglomerate General Electric, deferred comment on the trade war to an industry association.\n\n\u201cWe are assessing the potential impact of these tariffs on our industry,\u201d said Dak Hardwick, the vice president of International Affairs for the Aerospace Industries Association, in a statement, adding the trade war could change the industry\u2019s \u201cpositive trajectory.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war comes as GE Aerospace\u2019s international business has climbed to 55% of its total $38.7 billion in sales last year, up from 52% of sales in 2023 and up from 47% of sales in 2022, according to its annual report issued on Monday.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t name Trump in any of its 82 pages, but in the \u201crisk factors\u201d section it expresses clear concerns for his past trade war threats during his successful presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cPolitical changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as tariffs, export controls \u2026 or other laws and policies, have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cEscalation of tariffs or any other specific trade tensions \u2026 could be harmful to global economic growth or to our business in or with China or other countries. In addition, market uncertainty and volatility in various geographies may be magnified as a result of potential shifts in U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies following the recent U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nForeign factories may buffer Procter & Gamble\n\nWhile 52% of its business comes from outside the U.S., the largest consumer products company in the world may be shielded from the effects of tariffs in Trump\u2019s emerging trade war.\n\nWhy?

(Image: HyAxiom Inc.)\n\nWhen NASA started investing in fuel cell technology in the 1960s, the rest of the world was still content to be powered by fossil fuels. The simple imperative that drove NASA to explore new ways to generate and store energy was the crushing cost of launching mass into space: somewhere on the order of $10,000 per pound.\n\n\u201cNASA\u2019s interest in fuel cells had nothing to do with alternative energy \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any alternative,\u201d said John Scott, NASA\u2019s Principal Technologist for power and energy storage. \u201cWe had to make them work in order to fly the mission.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s earliest crewed spacecraft relied on batteries for onboard power. Energy requirements for the long round trip to the Moon, however, would have necessitated more batteries than could feasibly be launched.\n\nNASA funded development of the first practical fuel cells because they were necessary to cut weight from the Apollo spacecraft for Moon missions. Three fuel cells in the Apollo service module provided electricity for the capsule containing the astronauts. The division of Pratt & Whitney that made the fuel cells later became UTC Power, now a subsidiary of Doosan Group known as HyAxiom Inc. (Image: NASA)\n\nNASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, then called the Manned Spacecraft Center, stepped up to solve the problem. Engineers there considered fuel cells a potential solution because they had higher specific energy than batteries of the day, meaning they could, at least theoretically, provide more energy per pound over the course of a long mission. However, although the fuel cell concept had existed for more than a century, it had never been put to practical use.\n\nNASA awarded funding to General Electric, Allis-Chalmers Energy, and an arm of Pratt & Whitney to develop fuel cell prototypes, and General Electric was contracted to deliver fuel cells for the Gemini spacecraft, flown in preparation for the Apollo Moon shot.\n\nFor Apollo\u2019s fuel cells, NASA selected the Pratt & Whitney group, which became UTC Power, supplier of fuel cells for all the space shuttles and the seat of NASA fuel cell development for the next decades. With the space agency funding and shaping its fuel cell development, UTC eventually branched out into commercial fuel cells. After the Space Shuttle Program ended in 2011, the company changed hands a couple of times and is now known as HyAxiom Inc., a subsidiary of the South Korean Doosan Group.\n\nNow HyAxiom, which still produces fuel cells in the same manufacturing plant in South Windsor, Connecticut, that produced them for NASA, is experiencing a renaissance as alternative energy is increasingly seen as the way of the future.\n\nThis is the fuel cell design Pratt & Whitney created for the Apollo missions. It was only the world\u2019s second practical fuel cell design, the first having been invented by General Electric for NASA\u2019s Gemini missions, which were preparation for the Apollo Moon shot. (Image: NASA)\n\nUnlike a battery, which only stores energy, a fuel cell generates electricity and heat when hydrogen and oxygen bond through an electrolyte. The by-product of this reaction is better than harmless \u2014 it\u2019s water. This is the environmental advantage that makes fuel cells attractive today.\n\nWhile the Gemini fuel cell was based on a proton-exchange membrane (PEM), the cells UTC Power produced for Apollo and the space shuttle were alkaline fuel cells. Alkaline cells are extremely mass-efficient but have been too fussy for commercial applications. Much of the underlying technology, though, is similar across different types of fuel cells.\n\nNot only is the basic chemistry the same, but so are the fundamentals of \u201cwhat might be called the \u2018balance-of-plant\u2019 \u2014 which manages the reactant flow into the fuel cell stack and gets product water and the heat out,\u201d said Scott, noting that this hadn\u2019t been considered in practical terms until NASA started pursuing the technology.\n\nDuring the shuttle program, the space agency funded improvements that, for example, doubled space shuttle fuel cells\u2019 life from 2,500 to 5,000 hours.\n\nUTC Power released its first commercial product, a 200-kilowatt phosphoric acid fuel cell, in the mid-1990s. The company chose to commercialize cells with a phosphoric acid electrolyte in part because of their long lifespan, relatively common materials, and tolerance for impurities, said Sridhar Kanuri, HyAxiom\u2019s chief technology officer. They can also run on natural gas or liquid petroleum gas, with a reformer at the front end of the cell converting the gas to hydrogen to feed what is still a hydrogen fuel cell. About 10 years later, the company put out 440-kilowatt versions with better efficiency and twice the lifespan, Kanuri said. This is still the product line HyAxiom manufactures today.\n\nUTC Power, formerly a division of Pratt & Whitney and now known as HyAxiom, built the fuel cells for all of NASA\u2019s space shuttles. By the time the shuttle program closed down in 2011, the company was also producing its second-generation commercial fuel cells. (Image: NASA)\n\n\u201cThe models they built for these products we use today had a lot of the electrochemistry understanding from the space program,\u201d said Kanuri. \u201cSo, the knowledge that they gained got transferred down to these other products.\u201d\n\nProduction ramped up following the company\u2019s acquisition by Doosan in 2014, partly because that transaction opened up the burgeoning Korean market, and HyAxiom now produces around 120 units per year.\n\nIn the United States, these fuel cells can now be found powering Whole Foods, Stop & Shop, and ShopRite locations. They also power a Coca-Cola bottling plant not far from HyAxiom\u2019s facilities. The University of Connecticut and Rochester Institute of Technology use the company\u2019s fuel cells, as do CBS Studios in California and the new World Trade Center in New York. San Diego Gas and Electric uses the cells in its electrical grid. \u201cSo, these fuel cells are sprinkled all over the East and West coasts,\u201d Kanuri said.\n\nThe Korean market, meanwhile, is primarily in utilities. \u201cThey put up tens of megawatts of these fuel cells at a given site,\u201d said Kanuri. \u201cIn that configuration, we put anywhere between 10 and 125 fuel cell power plants in one location.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government offers incentives for fuel cell use, but the technology also has its own incentives, he said. While natural gas power generation on a typical electrical grid operates around 35 percent efficiency, HyAxiom fuel cells operate at 43 percent efficiency, so they already have an advantage, depending how close they\u2019re located to end users.\n\nWith governments around the world starting to invest heavily in fuel cell technologies, and with companies competing to meet increased demand, Kanuri said, the price of fuel cells should plunge. \u201cIf we can take the latest technology into mass production, I think that is where the costs are going to come down dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are producing fuel cells today in the hundreds of megawatts. If we can go to gigawatt-scale fuel cells, then you can beat out the grid with regard to cost.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government plans to use fuel cells to store energy from renewable sources. Electricity from solar panels or wind turbines would electrolyze water into clean hydrogen and oxygen, with the stored hydrogen then powering fuel cells when there\u2019s no sun or wind.\n\nHyAxiom has modified its technology to run on this clean hydrogen and has already installed 50 megawatts of these fuel cells at a petrochemical complex to generate power from hydrogen that otherwise would have been vented.\n\nHyAxiom\u2019s predecessor, UTC Power, also helped various companies develop PEM fuel cells for vehicles. UTC acquired PEM fuel cell patents decades ago from General Electric, which had cut its teeth making PEM cells for Gemini. UTC worked on fuel cell technology with Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, and BMW. \u201cThey did development programs with us, where we transferred knowledge and made prototypes for them,\u201d Kanuri said. Now, at least three of those companies have fuel cell-powered vehicles in limited production.\n\nScott said there isn\u2019t a commercial fuel cell today that doesn\u2019t owe some debt to NASA\u2019s early exploration of the technology. \u201cAll these companies trace their intellectual property heritage, their corporate heritage, even the generations of personnel to those three companies NASA funded back in the early \u201960s,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more information, visit here .",

            "content": "The USAF increased the funding for the development of advanced engines earmarked for sixth-generation fighters, with new contracts awarded to both General Electric Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney as part of the NGAP program.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force decided to accelerate the development of the engines for upcoming sixth-generation fighters, awarding contracts to both General Electric Aerospace and to RTX subsidiary Pratt & Whitney Engines. Both engine manufacturers had their previously issued contracts for the prototype phase upgraded from the original $975 million ceiling to the new $3.5 billion limit for each firm.\n\nThe original contracts were issued in 2022 as part of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, that at the time also included additional NGAP contracts for Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The upgraded contracts for GE Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are set to run for years, wrapping up in July 2032.\n\nNGAP Engines\n\nBoth General Electric and Pratt & Whitney previously designed engines for the Air Force\u2019s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), researching potential options for replacing the engines of the F-35 fleet with an improved and more fuel-efficient adaptive cycle engine. The U.S. Air Force announced in 2023 the decision to cancel AETP and instead upgrade the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, currently powering all the 3 variants of the F-35 stealth fighter, even if Congress later authorized additional funding for the AETP program.\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s XA100 and Pratt & Whitney\u2019s XA101, developed for AETP, have been the foundation of the improved XA102 and XA103 entrants of the NGAP program. XA102 and XA103 are both adaptive cycle engines, allowing for in-flight adjustment between different modes of operation, providing either more power when the need arises, or operating in a more fuel-efficient way to save fuel and improve the range of the aircraft.\n\nGeneral Electric previously declared that the earlier XA100 engine is around 25 percent more efficient than the existing F135 powerplant, while also offering between 10 and 20 percent more thrust. According to officials, by delivering better performance in thrust and fuel efficiency, the adaptive engine technologies developed under the AETP and NGAP programs could herald a \u201crevolutionary leap\u201d in airplane propulsion.\n\nThe notices for the modifications to the NGAP contracts, awarding more funds to GE Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney, describe the increase as funding additional \u201ctechnology maturation and risk reduction services\u201d in support of work on prototype engines.\n\n\u201cThe work includes design, analysis, rig testing, prototype engine build and testing, and weapon system integration,\u201d says the notice. \u201cThe contract [\u2026] is focused on delivering a state-of-the-art propulsion system with a flexible architecture that can be tailored for future combat aircraft operating across various mission threads; and digitally transforming the propulsion industrial base.\u201d\n\nPratt & Whitney finished a key design review of its own XA103 engine in February 2024, while General Electric announced in May 2024 that its XA102 engine finished a major design review in December 2023.\n\nBoth companies are expected to soon move towards building full scale engine prototypes and then undergo testing, but current plans for NGAP foresee eventually eliminating one of the two suppliers from the program.\n\nEven if the future of NGAD is still uncertain, NGAP engines could end up powering the U.S. Navy F/A-XX future sixth-generation carrier-capable stealth fighter, despite the Navy announcing plans to develop the plane independently from the Air Force\u2019s NGAD. Other platforms may also end up flying with the NGAP engines, or the prototype powerplants could be used as a base to further develop future engines.\n\nNGAD Review\n\nNGAP is expected to produce an engine for the upcoming Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) sixth-generation fighter jet, whose future is however suspended and awaiting a decision by the new Trump administration. The program underwent an extensive review of the project over the course of 2024, with the objective of reassessing the requirements for the 6th generation fighter and explore whether the development strategy aligns with the evolving threat landscape and budget realities.\n\nThe results of the NGAD review could reshape the program, shifting the focus from a manned 6th generation fighter jet to a more cost-effective and technologically advanced system of systems.\n\nWhile the initial focus was on creating a high-end fighter with advanced, cutting-edge capabilities, now the emphasis could shift toward a more integrated approach that considers the roles of unmanned drones like CCAs, bombers like the B-21 and a distributed network of capabilities.\n\nThe NGAD program is also suffering from an increase in cost, as the jets are predicted to have a price tag almost three times higher than 5th-generation F-35 fighters. In fact, each NGAD airframe could be priced between $250 million and $300 million, while the average unit price for F-35s in the latest production lots is around $82.5 million.\n\nUnmanned platforms, such as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), could serve alongside manned fighters, reducing the need of traditional, highly expensive 6th generation crewed aircraft. The CCA\u2019s price is expected to be between $20.6 million and $27.5 million, less than the $32 million value of an MQ-9 Reaper.\n\nThe Air Force is therefore pushing for a leaner and more efficient program, exploring ways to break up the NGAD\u2019s capabilities across multiple platforms to lower the overall cost. This could subsequently translate into a reduced emphasis on a single, all-encompassing platform in favor of a networked approach including unmanned vehicles, bombers, and cheaper fighters.",

Now on its own, GE Aerospace (GE -1.32%) is proving its mettle.\n\nShares of GE Aerospace gained 22% in January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the company posted a strong earnings report and provided an upbeat outlook for the year to come.\n\nA strong beat\n\nGE Aerospace is a collection of aircraft engines, interiors, and other components that became an independent company in April 2024 when General Electric completed a complex, multiyear breakup. Investors had high expectations for this business, and its fourth-quarter results did nothing to dispel that enthusiasm.\n\nGE earned $1.32 per share on sales of $10.8 billion, easily topping the consensus estimate for $1.04 per share on $9.5 billion in revenue. Earnings per share more than doubled and free cash flow was up more than 20% year over year.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 was just as promising, with GE reporting orders in the quarter up 46% year over year. CEO Larry Culp forecast double-digit revenue and earnings growth and strong free cash flow in the new year, saying, \"I'm confident in our ability to accelerate output and deliver for our customers.\"\n\nThe company also announced a 30% dividend increase and said it intends to repurchase upward of $7 billion worth of shares in 2025.\n\nThe results had a good impact on Wall Street, with at least a half-dozen banks raising their price target on the company.\n\nIs GE Aerospace stock a buy?\n\nAbout 75% of GE Aerospace sales come from commercial aerospace, a sector that has been impacted in recent years by issues at Boeing and supply constraints that have limited production of new aircraft. Both Boeing and Airbus have multiyear backlogs of future orders.\n\nGE Aerospace should benefit as these orders get filled, but the lack of new planes also works in the company's favor. Aerospace suppliers including GE tend to get higher margins on spare part sales and should benefit as airlines are forced to keep older planes in service for longer while awaiting deliveries.\n\nThis is a cyclical business and all trends point to the cycle accelerating in the years to come. Shares of GE Aerospace are up 27% in the last six months, and the ingredients are in place for this company to fly higher in the quarters to come.",

This is down from the 5,300 it hired in 2023 and the 4,100 it hired last year. Rayha said the slowdown for this year is related to parts of the supply chain, but still marks \u201ca significant year of hiring,\u201d and hiring will pick up when the work is ready.\n\n\u201cDespite a flatter trajectory, the future continues to be bright in Connecticut,\u201d he said during a legislative briefing Monday.\n\nTo put GDEB\u2019s hiring in context, hiring 12,000 people in three years is the greatest spike ever, more than any time during WWII or the Cold War, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney said.\n\nOf the 3,000 new hires, the company wants at least 10 percent to be recent high school graduates. To ensure a steady supply of young talent, GDEB continues to work on manufacturing pipeline initiatives. While they can train adults wanting a career change, they can also introduce school-aged children and teenagers to manufacturing careers with age-appropriate instruction and activities, Rayha said.\n\n\u201cThe young people that we hire in 2033, some of them are (currently) in 5th Grade,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Youth Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative on display during Labor Secretary Julie Su's visit\n\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat ended 2024 with 24,000 employees, with over 15,000 in Connecticut.\n\nWhat submarine manufacturing means for Connecticut\n\nThe need for more subs comes as the U.S. Navy wants to increase capabilities to keep up with foreign rivals like China, and begin providing submarines to allied countries, including Australia, Courtney said.\n\nThis will result in GDEB building one Columbia Class and two Virginia Class submarines each year.\n\nGDEB will get close to $24 billion in federal funding this year. It breaks down to $9.7 billion to fund building Columbia Class submarines, $9.1 billion to build Virginia Class submarines, and $5 billion to help grow the industrial base for making the Virginia Class submarines, Rayha said.\n\nThese contracts also mean more work and more money for suppliers across the country. In Connecticut, GDEB will do $1.36 billion in business across 333 companies over the next five years. The largest chunk of money, $620.2 million, will be paid to 127 eastern Connecticut businesses, Rayha said.\n\nLocal companies and industry\n\nWhile EB is having a slower hiring year, it\u2019s not impacting the 400 participants in the Eastern Workforce Investment Board\u2019s Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative for this year., EWIB President and CEO Michael Nogelo said.\n\nThe slow hiring year also gives members of the Eastern Advanced Manufacturing Alliance a chance to hire their own workers, as 62 percent of the member companies want to hire more people this year than last, Collins & Jewell President Chris Jewell said,\n\n\u201cIt will help the supply chain from our prospective because it gives us more options,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Collins & Jewell, last year ended with some concerns, but it's starting the new year with strong contracts, including infrastructure work for EB\u2019s Groton facility, Jewell said.\n\nEven if someone doesn\u2019t want to work for EB, there are 50 smaller manufacturers in eastern Connecticut, 43 of which have hired graduates of the Manufacturing Pipeline Initiative in the past, Nogelo said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a range of options in eastern Connecticut,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins & Jewell currently employs 95, and they want to end the year at between 100-110 employees with no turnover by the end of the year.\n\nManufacturing and Healthcare are still the two priority industries EWIB wants to support in eastern Connecticut, and they\u2019ll provide strong job opportunities into the foreseeable future, Nogelo said.\n\nHousing and daycare remain a concern\n\nWith a growing workforce, EB hopes to put pressure on local communities to provide more housing stock, as the majority of their employees live within 20 miles of the Groton or Quonset Point, RI facilities, Rayha said.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat is also working with the state Office of Early Childhood Education on daycare solutions for EB workers, especially those working second shift, Director of Talent Management Courtney Murphy said.\n\nAny business who helps to tackle these issues in the region should expect their hard work to pay off, Jewell said.",

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Portland General Electric\n\nPortland General Electric's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Portland General Electric grew its EPS by 8.2% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Portland General Electric is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.1 percentage points to 16%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Portland General Electric's forecast profits?\n\nAre Portland General Electric Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own Portland General Electric shares worth a considerable sum. To be specific, they have US$21m worth of shares. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. While their ownership only accounts for 0.5%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.",

The company was founded by Thomas Edison as the Edison General Electric Company and shortened its name to General Electric following a merger with two other early electric pioneers. The name was later shortened again to GE. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but has operations on a global scale. One of the original 12 Dow stocks, the company was a component of the index for 122 years until its ousting in 2018.\n\nOriginally intended to make and market Edison\u2019s incandescent lamp and following products, the company grew over the years through mergers, acquisitions, and natural expansion into newly created fields. Among the many early accomplishments is the creation of RCA and NBC which will both become forces of their own. Other major innovations include the world\u2019s first turbine superchargers, industrial gas turbine engines, and the first jet engine. In the field of computing, General Electric Company is credited as being one of the 8 major computer companies of the 1960s and shares responsibility for today\u2019s digital world. In regard to its employees, two were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work with the company.\n\nToday GE operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates through four segments including Power, Renewables, Aerospace, and Healthcare although there are plans in the works to split the company into three separate entities. The three new companies would be GE Vernova (power and renewables), GE Health, and GE Aerospace. The spin-offs are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nThe Power segment offers a variety of turbine engines for power production as well as the full range of services from plant construction to retrofit and refit. The Renewables segment is focused on solutions for renewable energy including wind and hydro and the technology to operate them. The Aviation segment manufactures aircraft engines of all varieties and the Healthcare segment offers technology for imaging, monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery to health and medical facilities.\n\nGeneral Electric is committed to helping the world transition to a greener way of life and is exiting the new-build coal-fired power industry. Instead, its advancements in wind, grid efficiency, and natural gas are being deployed around the world helping to reduce emissions and generate cleaner energy for businesses, industry, and communities. The company is targeting 2030 for its own carbon neutrality and 2050 for net zero emissions.",

            "content": "The main aim of stock picking is to find the market-beating stocks. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Portland General Electric Company ( ) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 33% over a half decade. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 12% in the last three months.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Portland General Electric actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 7.5% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\n\nDue to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.\n\nWe note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nPortland General Electric is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Portland General Electric the TSR over the last 5 years was -18%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nPortland General Electric shareholders gained a total return of 8.9% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 3% endured over half a decade. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

            "content": "GM Energy makes your General Motors EV a revolutionary energy asset\n\nBack\n\nBy Wade Sheffer, vice president, GM Energy\n\nElectric vehicles offer clear and immediate benefits, like reduced maintenance and no tailpipe emissions. But what customers are just discovering is that EVs can be more than just transportation. At General Motors, we\u2019re building a future where your EV is the heart of a system that powers your drive, your home, and your lifestyle.\n\nGM Energy is here to harness the power of EVs to provide reliable, accessible and convenient power. This system is built on four pillars: Public charging, home charging, home energy management, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 knowledge. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re building an EV-powered future.\n\nPublic charging\n\nCaption: We\u2019re committed to providing robust public charging infrastructure across the U.S.\n\nWhen it comes to charging your EV, GM Energy has one simple goal: provide the most charging opportunities possible, across the country. That starts with quality, reliable, publicly available fast charging.\n\nToday, our customers have access to more than 231,000 public charging ports, including nearly 50,000 DC fast chargers across the U.S., and there are more chargers being added every day. GM believes in a collaborative approach: we\u2019re bringing together policy makers, public utilities, and charging-solutions providers to build a robust national charging infrastructure backed by General Motors.\n\nWe\u2019re working alongside industry leaders and our GM Enterprise Data, Analytics & Insights (EDAI) team, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify strategic locations where public chargers can be most beneficial \u2013 along interstate highways, in busy suburbs, and in dense urban areas where home charging might not be available to those who rent their homes.\n\nGM Energy is working with EVgo to install more than 2,000 fast charging stalls in high-traffic locations across America. In December, we announced a new collaboration with ChargePoint to add up to 500 fast-charging stalls across America, and the first site is already operational. We\u2019re also collaborating with Pilot Flying J to add fast-charger lanes to their travel centers where drivers know they can find food, beverages and clean facilities on a long road trip. And we\u2019re one of eight founding global automakers of IONNA , a joint venture tasked with building attractive charging rest stops tailored to EV drivers\u2019 needs.\n\nWith a NACS charging adapter, available at Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac dealers or via our mobile brand apps, you can charge your GM electric vehicle at more than 20,000 Tesla Supercharger locations across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve made it easy to get to the nearest charger from anywhere. Whether you\u2019re using your GM EV\u2019s built-in navigation system or your GM mobile brand app, you can map out exactly where and when to stop for a charge, so you\u2019re never left guessing or worried about getting stranded. When you stop at a public charging station, you can use the GM mobile brand app to pay for your charging session right from your smartphone.\n\nHome charging\n\nCaption: With a home charging system installed, your GM EV\u2014like the 2025 Cadillac LYRIQ shown here\u2014is ready to go when you are.\n\nHave you ever been able to refuel your car at home? With an EV and a home charger, you can. Imagine waking up every morning with a full battery. For most American drivers, charging at home overnight can cover up to 80 percent of your driving needs. And with the latest electric vehicles from General Motors, a full battery gives you plenty of range for a full day of driving. For example, the 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali can go a GM-estimated 460 miles on a fully charged battery (1) \u2013 enough to drive the length of the Grand Canyon twice.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to switch to an EV, our team of GM Energy advisors is here to help you choose the right home charger for your needs. When you drive off the lot in your new EV, you\u2019ll have the knowledge and equipment you\u2019ll need to stay charged up and ready to go.\n\nHome energy management\n\n[VIDEO GOES HERE: https://generalmotors.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/msteams_e6e940/EeQQ0GyMDydGqPAIL5-yrvQBnr9FOqZ8hsz29F_gHgmIUg ]\n\nThe GM EV in your driveway isn\u2019t just a transportation tool \u2013 it's the key to energy freedom. Your compatible EV\u2019s battery can provide power to your properly equipped home during a blackout, giving you security and peace of mind during natural disasters or utility outages.\n\nWith a GM Energy PowerShift charger and the V2H Enablement Kit installed in your home, you can unlock bidirectional charging, enabling you to harness the electric power in your car to provide energy to your home during an outage. On its own, PowerShift gives you the fastest home charging available. Add the V2H Enablement Kit, and you can use your compatible EV\u2019s battery to provide power to your properly equipped home during a blackout. You can custom tailor this capability to fit your needs, all controlled via your GM mobile brand app.\n\nIf you really want to experience more resilience and control over your home energy, the GM Energy Home System adds stationary battery power for always-ready backup energy for your home. The GM Energy PowerBank takes in energy from the grid and stores it for when you need it most. By combining two 17.7 kWh GM Energy PowerBanks, consumers can create 35.4 kWh of stationary storage, enough to power the average American home for up to 20 hours (2). Or you can charge up your GM Energy PowerBank when energy rates are low and go to battery power when they\u2019re high.\n\nPlus, if you\u2019ve got solar power, your GM Energy Home System can now capture energy from the sun and store it directly in your GM Energy PowerBank to use to provide power to your home when rates are high, when the power is out, or when the sun isn\u2019t shining. You now have your own energy source.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nVehicle-to-home charging gives us a glimpse of what the future of EVs will bring: Vehicle-to-grid. GM Energy is working alongside the largest utilities in the country to build a future where EV owners can sell their energy back to the grid \u2013 they can act as a virtual powerplant. With this future technology, EVs can be an asset to our infrastructure, storing and transferring energy in ways that were never before possible.\n\nWe\u2019re building that future every day. Whether it\u2019s opening new charging destinations or building systems that make energy resilience available to everyday drivers, GM Energy is working hard to stay at the forefront.

Now it\u2019s a three-peat for our highest-rated electric pickup, in spite of more rivals entering the arena. The thing is, we\u2019re still struck by the whole Lightning package. The pricing is competitive, it\u2019s capable of traveling a long way before needing a recharge, the tech is excellent, we love the spacious crew cab format, and it\u2019s built by Ford \u2014 a company with years of experience making top-rated pickups.\n\nMiles Per Charge, Miles Per Hour\n\nRange, the distance between charges, is a Lightning strength. With the optional Extended Range battery, it can run for up to 320 miles. Every version of the Lightning has two electric motors and all-wheel drive (AWD). The most muscular version generates a substantial 580 horsepower and can zip from a standstill to 60 mph in only four seconds. That would be awesome in a sports car. This is a full-size truck.\n\nTop Tech\n\nThe Lightning is one of the most tech-rich vehicles in Ford\u2019s portfolio. The infotainment system offers a large 15.5-inch touchscreen, along with Bang & Olufsen audio setups, and the Phone As A Key feature in the FordPass app. The standard Mega Power Frunk (front trunk) has four 120-volt outlets, plus a couple of USB ports. The Lightning even has the option of a 240-volt outlet in the bed.\n\nA standard array of safety systems includes automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring. Ford also offers its partial self-driving BlueCruise feature that works on thousands of miles of freeways in the United States and Canada. We\u2019ve tried this on many occasions in several Ford vehicles and have always been impressed. Check out our full review for more information.\n\nPull Here\n\nThe F-150 Lightning isn\u2019t just a well-executed electric vehicle (EV), it can also do the work. Its maximum towing figure is an eminently usable 10,000 pounds, while a total payload of 2,000 pounds is another positive. And under the hood is a drainable storage area of 14.1 cubic feet \u2014 about the same size as a Honda Civic\u2019s trunk \u2014 which can carry up to 400 pounds.\n\nBottled Lightning\n\nFord knows F-150 buyers expect a wide variety of choices and the company meets that demand even with this electric pickup. The base Pro model comes with a crew cab and at a price similar to a gasoline-powered equivalent. The XLT trim adds more amenities and eligibility for the Extended Range battery. The popular Flash trim has that bigger battery as standard, as well as plenty of tech features. Lariat heads uptown with leather and a dual-pane moonroof, while Platinum goes full-on luxury with massaging front seats, an upgraded audio system, and 22-inch alloy wheels.\n\nPhoto Tour\n\n2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning\n\nMore 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning\n\nRead our full review\n\nBuild and price your own\n\nBrowse listings near you\n\nOur 2025 Best Buy Award Winners",

            "content": "The recent fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report from GE Aerospace (GE -1.32%) blew away expectations. Still, if you are thinking of buying or continuing to hold the stock, you are probably thinking about what the company will look like in a year, at least as much as now.\n\nIn that context, here's what a snapshot of GE could look like and whether it would make the stock a good value.\n\nGE Aerospace: rising expectations\n\nThere's no escaping the fact that GE's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings were much better than expected. As such, the positive reaction to the earnings report was no surprise.\n\nTo put it into context, management's guidance from the third-quarter earnings report in October called for commercial engines and services (CES) full-year operating profit of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion; ultimately it came in at $7.1 billion.\n\nGiven that GE earned $4.9 billion in operating income in the first three quarters, the fourth-quarter performance of $2.2 billion was way ahead of the implied guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.\n\nSimilarly, in the other segment, defense and propulsion technologies (DPT), GE delivered a full-year operating profit of $1.1 billion, compared to the lower end of the previous guidance for $1 billion to $1.3 billion.\n\nAs such, both segments reported earnings ahead of guidance. In summary, GE Aerospace continues to exceed expectations due to excellent growth in its commercial-engine services business. The company's momentum will likely continue through 2025 since its order growth remains robust.\n\nGE Aerospace projections\n\nAccording to management's guidance, the company's metrics will look like this at the end of 2025:\n\nOperating profit of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion, compared to $7.3 billion in 2024.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 to $5.45, compared to $4.60 in 2024.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, compared to $6.1 billion in 2024.\n\nPutting all this together, at the end of 2025, based on the midpoint of the guidance above and the current share price, GE Aerospace will be a company growing earnings by 14.7% and trading at 37 times earnings and slightly less than 34 times FCF.\n\nWhile those valuations look expensive, investors need to consider that the snapshot will also show a company set for mid-teens growth in 2026. Moreover, there are a few other reasons to believe the company is set for long-term growth.\n\nGood news for GE Aerospace investors\n\nThe long-term case for buying the stock rests on the decades-long revenue streams from its higher-margin services/aftermarket sales on its airplane engines. The company is the dominant player in the commercial engine market.\n\nIts joint venture with France's Safran, CFM International, produces the CFM56 (used on the legacy Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737), and the LEAP engine (used on the Boeing 737 MAX and the A320 neo family). GE also makes engines for Boeing's wide-body airplanes.\n\nAs the installed base shifts to the LEAP engine, GE Aerospace's services revenue will migrate from the CFM56 to the LEAP. Management had good news on this front.\n\nFirst, chief financial officer Rahul Ghai confirmed that \"LEAP services became profitable in 2024. And the program becomes breakeven in 2025, with original equipment following a year later in 2026.\"\n\nSecond, the delay in new airplane deliveries at Boeing and Airbus means older planes are being run more, so the period when services revenue on the CFM56 engine timeline has been pushed out. Indeed, Ghai noted that based on the current trajectory, LEAP and CFM56 will deliver the same profit for GE Aerospace \"sometime in late toward the end part of this decade.\"\n\nIn summary, the CFM56 revenue outlook is improving, and LEAP profitability is improving more than anticipated.\n\nThird, management said it expected 15% to 20% more LEAP deliveries in 2025, with engine volume growth in the high teens, LEAP deliveries up 15% to 20%, and pricing more than offsetting \"negative engine mix\" according to Ghai.\n\nThat's a very positive statement because investors had reason to fear the increase in engine deliveries (which are typically sold at a loss, hence the \"negative engine mix\" comment) would hold back CES margins.\n\nGE Aerospace in one year\n\nThe company is likely to be in a strong position next year, with mid-teens earnings growth in the bag and given its outlook. Meanwhile, LEAP deliveries should grow again as LEAP services expand profitability and the overall LEAP program turns profitable.\n\nWhile it might not be enough to make GE a buy at this level, it puts the stock in the category as being an investment to make on any significant market-led weakness.",

            "content": "Libya\u2019s energy sector has had a turbulent few years, owing to political unrest and a significant shift in foreign investment in its oil and gas sector. While its fossil fuel industry is struggling to rebound to its former glory, there is significant potential for the development of the North African country\u2019s renewable energy sector. Its large desert terrain shows great potential for the development of solar and wind energy projects, and the government has shown greater commitment to decarbonization and a green transition in recent years, which higher levels of foreign investment could help Libya achieve.\n\nLibya has long been known as a major oil and gas power, pumping almost 3.4 million bpd during its peak production period in the 1970s. However, its crude output has fallen significantly, to around 32 percent of its peak, placing it at around 18th in the world for production. The government now aims to produce 2 million bpd by 2030, after falling short of its ambitious target of 2.2 million bpd by 2023 largely due to several years of political unrest and poor governance.\n\nSince the overthrow of Libya\u2019s leader Qaddafi in 2011, several groups have vied for political power. Now, the Government of National Stability (GNS), which is backed by Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, holds sway over the eastern and southwestern regions, where most of Libya\u2019s oil fields are located, and the Government of National Unity (GNU), supported by Turkey, several Western powers, and endorsed by the UN, controls the capital of Tripoli. The GNS, has control of key terminals, such as Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, accounting for 42 percent of Libya\u2019s oil export capacity. Meanwhile, the GNU controls two export facilities, Zawiya and Mellitah, which contribute 28 percent of Libya\u2019s oil exports. Both powers have staged blockades or production shutdowns, which have hindered oil output and discouraged foreign powers from investing in the country\u2019s fossil fuel industry.\n\nDespite Libya\u2019s huge oil potential, the ongoing political conflict and the lack of interest from foreign investors have revealed the need to diversify the country\u2019s energy mix. Oil continues to contribute around 98 percent of its government revenues and 60 percent of its GDP, showing that Libya has an overreliance on fossil fuels and could benefit from greater economic diversification. In addition, the development of a strong renewable energy sector could help the North African country to ensure its energy security in the future.\n\nIn 2013, the Libyan government announced its Renewable Energy Strategic 2013-2025 Plan, intending to achieve a 7 percent renewable energy contribution to the electric energy mix by 2020 and 10 percent by 2025. The plan focused on the development of the country\u2019s wind and solar energy capacity. Around 88 percent of Libya\u2019s terrain is desert, with significant potential for the development of solar power projects.\n\nAt present, the construction firm PowerChina is working with the French utility EDF to develop a 1,500 MW solar plant in the east of the country. Meanwhile, France\u2019s TotalEnergies is constructing a 500 MW solar plant in Al-Sadada. In addition, GECOL and AG Energy are building a 200 MW solar plant in Ghadames, and the Libyan General Electric Company (GECOL) is also working with Alpha Dubai Holding to develop two more solar plants, with a combined capacity of 2 GW.\n\nIn January, Libya\u2019s government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Turkey for cooperation in the field of renewable energy. Abdusselam Elansari, the head of the Renewable Energy Authority of Libya, stated, \u201cWe are cooperating with different Turkish companies in terms of electricity, power and renewable energy.\u201d Elansari added, \u201cWe have started a capacity-building program to train our people with a Turkish company in the field of human resources, renewable energy, technical renewable energy, electricity connection, performance excellence and other sectors of cooperation\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osama El Durrat, advisor to the Libyan Prime Minister for electricity and renewable energy affairs, said that Libya is assessing the possibility of connecting its power grid with neighboring countries. El Durrat stated, \u201cA committee is being formed to advance cross-border electricity interconnections. We have signed agreements with several southern European and Mediterranean countries. As for Turkey, we believe the connection could be facilitated through a neighboring country, enabling energy transfer between Libya and Turkey.\u201d\n\nLibya\u2019s significant renewable energy potential could help garner more interest from international energy companies looking to invest in the region. In 2023, Italian firm Eni signed an MoU with Libya to identify opportunities to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and develop the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity, to support the government\u2019s decarbonization and green transition targets. As the government shows greater interest in the development of a green energy sector, higher levels of foreign investment could help Libya accelerate the expansion of its renewable energy sector, contributing to economic diversification and long-term energy security.\n\nBy Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Here's what to look out for.\n\nGE Aerospace margin\n\nIt's essential to understand the dynamics of the CES margin. The business model in the model commercial airplane engine market typically involves selling engines at a loss (the so-called \"negative engine margin\"), then making money over decades of providing aftermarket parts and services for those engines.\n\nAs such, when the number of engines CES produced dropped by 7.9% in 2024 (including a 10.4% decline in LEAP engines), its profit margin rose compared to 2023.\n\nCommercial Engines & Services Segment\n\nQ4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Revenue $6.43 bn $6.07 bn $6.13 bn $7.0 bn $7.65 bn Operating profit margin 23.3% 23.3% 27.4% 25.7% 28.2% Operating profit $1.5 bn $1.4 bn $1.7 bn $1.8 bn $2.2 bn\n\nHowever, management expects a 15% to 20% growth in LEAP deliveries in 2025, which will negatively impact the CES segment's margins. Still, GE Aerospace's services margin outperformed expectations last year. Suppose it can continue to do so in 2025. In that case, GE Aerospace hopes to achieve an operating profit figure at the higher end of its guidance range of $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion for CES.\n\nGE Aerospace in 2025\n\nInvestors need to monitor the interplay between LEAP deliveries (more is good for the company's long-term prospects, but cuts into its near-term margins) and its reported profit margins. Merely maintaining 2024's quarterly margins would be an excellent result for GE Aerospace, not least as management expects CES revenues to grow at a mid-teens percentage rate this year.",

Jim Franco/Times Union\n\nSCHENECTADY \u2014 A day after announcing a $96 million expansion of its research labs in Niskayuna, GE Vernova showed off another $90 million investment underway at its historic Schenectady manufacturing campus.\n\nGE Vernova was spun off from General Electric Co. in April of last year, part of a plan by the company to split into three separate companies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile the split of GE, which once employed 40,000 local residents during World War II, may have caused initial worry among local business and political leaders about jobs and the future, Thursday\u2019s event showed that a rebirth is underway.\n\nDecades ago, Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara\u2019s father worked at the GE plant, like so many people in and around Schenectady County. The main plant is 1.1 million-square-feet of space, making it one of the largest manufacturing buildings in the U.S., even today. The building dates back to the mid-20th century, although it has been rebuilt on the inside several times.\n\nSantabarbara represents the assembly district where the GE Vernova campus is located.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a story that a lot of people shared back then,\u201d Santabarbara said, addressing the media, GE executives and local elected officials. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason people came to Schenectady to work for GE. And thousands and thousands of people walked through these doors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGE Vernova announced Wednesday that it is investing $600 million in its U.S. factories, creating 1,500 new jobs. The $96 million announced Wednesday will be for two new labs in Niskayuna focused on electrification and decarbonization. It will expand existing facilities on the campus and rehab two buildings at its Renewable Learning Center.\n\nIn Schenectady, GE Vernova is spending $90 million and hiring 100 new workers. There are a total of 900 workers at the plant working around the clock on steam turbine assembly.\n\nThe latest venture involves making onshore wind turbines for the U.S. and international markets. GE Vernova can now make 150 wind turbines (not the blades) in Schenectady and can triple that capacity if needed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe investments in manufacturing in Schenectady and elsewhere are part of a larger $9 billion investment by GE Vernova through 2028 as the company ventures on its own.",

            "content": "A lot has changed at General Electric, or what remains of the company, which is now known as GE Aerospace (GE -1.32%). In fact, 2024 was its first year after a dramatic company overhaul.\n\nThere are very positive things going on here, and they haven't gone unnoticed. Which sets up the tough question of whether or not GE Aerospace is a millionaire-maker stock.\n\nThe breakup of General Electric\n\nThe problems at General Electric came to the fore during the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2009. Back then, the company was a sprawling conglomerate with operations in the industrial, media, and finance sectors.\n\nIt was the finance sector that was the company's undoing. A government bailout, a dividend cut, and years upon years of effort to get GE back on its feet all led up to what amounted to the ultimate breakup of the company.\n\nIn fact, it required bringing in an outsider to finish the job. Historically, GE promoted from within, but internal leaders just weren't getting the job done this time around.\n\nThe final move, made by Larry Culp, was to break GE into three businesses: GE Verona, GE Healthcare, and GE Aerospace. The GE ticker was kept by GE Aerospace, which effectively owns what remained after all of the changes that were made at the company. Some might view it as something of a sad ending to a once-iconic conglomerate.\n\nThat said, GE Aerospace is a pretty attractive company. Notably, Culp chose to remain the CEO of this business, which hints that he liked it best of all among the former GE's operations. The first year as a stand-alone company shows why.\n\nGE Aerospace is flying high\n\nTo quickly summarize 2024, GE Aerospace saw orders increase 32% year over year with revenue up 9%. Adjusted earnings, which take out one-time items (a big issue in what amounted to a transition year), rose 56%.\n\nAnd, thanks to the impressive order flow, Culp happily announced that his company expects double-digit growth in revenue and earnings per share in 2025. The longer-term trajectory is likely to be strong, too, as more and more people around the world begin to travel via airlines thanks to rising living standards.\n\nThis is all good news for investors who owned the stock in 2024, noting that the share price has risen well over 80% over the past year. For comparison, the S&P 500 index is up around 25% over the same span. However, the really important comparison is more likely the 38% gain of the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF . Clearly, investors saw what was going on at GE Aerospace and priced in that good news very quickly.\n\nAt this point, the stock has moved very far very fast. That's highlighted by the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 32 versus the average for the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF of around 27. GE Aerospace is an attractive company with a strong and growing business, but it also appears to be a relatively expensive stock.\n\nThis millionaire maker could take time some\n\nThis is where a tough choice has to be made. If you buy GE Aerospace today hoping that it will continue to rocket higher and make you an overnight millionaire, there is a reasonable risk that you'll be let down. There is so much good news priced into the stock that GE Aerospace can't afford to slip up.\n\nHowever, if you think in decades and not days, what remains of the old GE appears very well positioned for long-term growth.\n\nIt just might be a bumpy flight in the near term as Wall Street's early excitement about the stock ebbs and flows. So, yes, GE Aerospace could be a millionaire maker over a long enough period and with a sufficient upfront investment, but it is highly likely that it is ongoing business growth that gets it there. That story has to play out over the years ahead, which means only long-term investors will probably want to jump aboard what appears to be a rather expensive stock today.",

The company was founded by Thomas Edison as the Edison General Electric Company and shortened its name to General Electric following a merger with two other early electric pioneers. The name was later shortened again to GE. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but has operations on a global scale. One of the original 12 Dow stocks, the company was a component of the index for 122 years until its ousting in 2018.\n\nOriginally intended to make and market Edison\u2019s incandescent lamp and following products, the company grew over the years through mergers, acquisitions, and natural expansion into newly created fields. Among the many early accomplishments is the creation of RCA and NBC which will both become forces of their own. Other major innovations include the world\u2019s first turbine superchargers, industrial gas turbine engines, and the first jet engine. In the field of computing, General Electric Company is credited as being one of the 8 major computer companies of the 1960s and shares responsibility for today\u2019s digital world. In regard to its employees, two were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work with the company.\n\nToday GE operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates through four segments including Power, Renewables, Aerospace, and Healthcare although there are plans in the works to split the company into three separate entities. The three new companies would be GE Vernova (power and renewables), GE Health, and GE Aerospace. The spin-offs are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nThe Power segment offers a variety of turbine engines for power production as well as the full range of services from plant construction to retrofit and refit. The Renewables segment is focused on solutions for renewable energy including wind and hydro and the technology to operate them. The Aviation segment manufactures aircraft engines of all varieties and the Healthcare segment offers technology for imaging, monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery to health and medical facilities.\n\nGeneral Electric is committed to helping the world transition to a greener way of life and is exiting the new-build coal-fired power industry. Instead, its advancements in wind, grid efficiency, and natural gas are being deployed around the world helping to reduce emissions and generate cleaner energy for businesses, industry, and communities. The company is targeting 2030 for its own carbon neutrality and 2050 for net zero emissions.",

The business unit is a combination of two previously separate businesses: Solar and Storage Solutions, and Power Conversion.\n\nBy manufacturing the inverters in the U.S., GE Vernova said it \u201caims to address critical supply chain challenges, aligning with national priorities to strengthen U.S. energy independence while supporting decarbonization goals.\u201d\n\nThe investment is part of a broader investment of more than $560 million that the company plans to infuse into its U.S. operations within the next two years. Though most of the $10 million portion will go toward solar and energy storage manufacturing, most of GE Vernova\u2019s investment focuses on gas power, grid, nuclear and onshore wind manufacturing sites. Specifically:\n\nMore than $275 million will go to GE Vernova\u2019s gas power business and build-out of capacity for liquid natural gas exports.\n\n$99 million will go toward the company\u2019s onshore wind manufacturing facilities.\n\nMore than $100 million will go toward the company\u2019s Advanced Research Center.\n\nNearly $20 million will go toward expanding capacity at its Grid Solutions facilities, which manufacture switchgear, capacitors and instrument transformers.\n\nMore than $50 million will go toward the company\u2019s nuclear business.\n\nMore than $10 million will go to the Pittsburgh facility to expand the company\u2019s Electrification segment, including domestic manufacturing for the Flexinverter.\n\nAccording to GE Vernova, the company\u2019s inverters currently under deployment contribute to a total of more than 30 GW of power around the world. The Flexinverters are used for utility-scale solar and energy storage applications.\n\nGE Vernova is the energy spin-off of the former General Electric, which broke into three standalone companies in 2023 and 2024: GE Healthcare, GE Vernova and GE Aerospace. Headquartered in Massachusetts, GE Vernova has 18 manufacturing factories around the U.S. According to GE Vernova, the company helps generate about 25% of the world\u2019s electricity, which is deployed in more than 140 countries.",

The test was conducted by a combined U.S. Army and industry test team and operated by Army and Sikorsky pilots, said the company.\n\nThe engine was developed as part of the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) to upgrade the service\u2019s UH-60 and AH-64 Apache fleet with new, more fuel efficient, durable and powerful engines. The T901 engine was also meant for the now-cancelled Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA).\n\nOn both the helicopters, the T901 would replace the older T700 engine, producing 50% more power, 25% reduction in fuel consumption, in line with the U.S. military overall carbon reduction and emission goals. The T700 has logged more than 100 million flight hours over the last four decades.\n\nWe have light off!

Their purpose is not known, but it is possible they might contain sensors and recording devices to collect data on the rotors\u2019 performance with the new engines.\n\nUsing the two T901s installed on the UH-60, the engine \u201cdemonstrated its capabilities through a series of rigorous procedures,\u201d overseen by a combined team of U.S. Army, Sikorsky, GE Aerospace engineers and test pilots.\n\nThe video released by the company showed the initial engine startup (ignition), with the smoke billowing from the exhaust, with both the rotors eventually running after the gearbox has been engaged. The engine was tested in its \u201cstart-to-fly progression, including idle and fly modes and with the rotor brake disengaged,\u201d Sikorsky said in a statement.\n\nThe start-to-fly progression tests the functionality of the entire system, from the engine start sequence to the engagement of the main rotor to enable lift-off. Both Sikorsky and GE Aerospace identified the testing areas pertaining to the fuel, electrical, hydraulic, engine bay flow, and flight control systems, besides acquiring test data from \u201cengine instrumentation.\u201d The successful ground test set the stage for more advanced testing, such as hover and forward flight tests.\n\nThe 3,000 shaft horsepower offering 50% more power would allow the helicopters to carry greater loads, across longer distances, a useful feature in a vast maritime battlespace of the western Pacific theater. The interest in saving on fuel cost has also been reflected in U.S. Air Force\u2019s programs like the microvanes on C-17 Globemaster III aircraft and the Blended Wing-Body \u201cPathfinder\u201d program.\n\nAdditionally, GE Aerospace has also made use of additive manufacturing and 3D printing, beside conventional machining and metal forging, to produce many of the T901\u2019s components. This reduces life-cycle and maintenance costs, simplifying the supply chains. Additionally, the extra power would also be useful for the electronic warfare capabilities being packed onto the Apache, since the microelectronics and sensors need greater electrical supply.\n\nGround tested on FARA prototype Raider X first\n\nDefense News quoted Sikorsky president Paul Lemmo in May 2024, who proposed using the ITEP engine in its FARA prototype, the Raider X, ahead of the installation into the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. At the time, the Army\u2019s plan to replace all Black Hawk and Apache helicopter engines with ITEP power plants had been delayed owing to technical issues and supply chain disruptions following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. Army received its first T901 engines for the FARA program in early-Oct. 2023. Sikorsky eventually tested the ITEP on its FARA prototype, the Raider X, in Apr. 2024 at its facility in West Palm Beach in Florida, with Lemmo saying it \u201cperformed well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s under a full load in a real aircraft turning rotors,\u201d Lemmo said in the report. \u201cWe collected that data at low speed, we\u2019re analyzing it and the Army\u2019s authorized us to now run up to full speed on the ground to collect more data.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce2 BIG NEWS! \ud83d\udce2 The @USARMY announced today the acceptance of the first #T901 engine for the service\u2019s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. We couldn\u2019t be more proud to share in today\u2019s significant milestone for the #USArmy! More \u27a1\ufe0f: https://t.co/AN8B6zAc1s#ArmyAviation pic.twitter.com/bmXv5UHiYD \u2014 GE Aerospace (@GE_Aerospace) October 4, 2023\n\nTests of the ITEP so far were on test stands, but the ground run on the FARA\u2019s Raider X generated valuable data for analysis. The engine itself was fitted into the Raider X without any issues. The ITEP was then scheduled to go into a Black Hawk later in 2024, which happened recently. Needless to say, those results gave valuable insights into the engine\u2019s performance on the UH-60, besides drawing up a comprehensive testing plan.\n\nDuring the 2024 edition of the Army Aviation Association of America in Apr. 2024, Brig. Gen. David Phillips, the program executive officer for aviation, said they planned to deliver two ITEP engines to Sikorsky by June of that year, mentioned another Defense News report. These were delivered by Jun. 27, 2024, with the service later authorizing Sikorsky to run the rotors at full speed.\n\nWhile one engine was used to conduct the \u201cfit check\u201d in one of the two modified Black Hawk helicopters, the other one would conduct the actual ground runs and flight tests. At the time, Lemmo anticipated a timeline of six months from integration of the engine, to the ground runs and actual flight, with Phillips predicting 2025 for the first flight. This rough schedule appears to have broadly been followed.",

On Thursday, General Electric showed off how the influx will be felt at its Schenectady plant.\n\nOn a tour of GE Vernova\u2019s building 273, Plant Leader Brian Carlson says the funding will support efforts to enhance sustainability, improve gas power manufacturing, and strengthen onshore wind manufacturing capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe've bought equipment to expand the capacity for gas power. Very specific examples, we bought three more machines, like the one behind me, and then we've bought other equipment throughout the facility, which raise our capacity about 30 percent as we see this growth coming, and it's focused more on the gas power side,\u201d Carlson. \u201cSo, this is an example of a tape machine, and we literally bought three more of these, which will be arriving in the next year and a half.\u201d\n\nGE announced $600 million in investments for its plants nationwide, creating roughly 1,500 jobs over the next two years.\n\nThe Schenectady plant will receive roughly $90 million and its research center in nearby Niskayuna will receive approximately $100 million. Combined, the nearly $200 million investment in the Capital Region will create 175 jobs.\n\nAt the research center, the funding is expected to strengthen electrification and decarbonization efforts, advance technologies like carbon dioxide removal, alternative fuels for power generation, and infrastructure security.\n\nAside from wind and gas, factory employees work on technologies like steam turbines and nuclear components that eventually get shipped, in parts, around the world.\n\nCarlson says improvements are already in the works.\n\n\u201cPurchase orders are already placed. We're expediting material from suppliers,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cSome of it will begin showing up this year, and then out through 2026 as we continue to capacities the place. So, the money is spent, we just got to try to get it here as fast as we can.\u201d\n\nTim Brown, a spokesperson for GE\u2019s wind department, says the company is confident it will receive already promised federal funding despite President Trump\u2019s aversion to clean energy policies.\n\nIn addition to a sudden freeze in federal funding, the White House has pledged to halt a Biden-era policy under which the Department of Energy spent billions of dollars per year on clean energy research, development and demonstration to speed up a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe work with administrations on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe think there's clearly a focus on all of the above energy approach in the country. So, we're confident the equipment we make here is for gas, wind, nuclear. There's a lot of work for the good people here to do to make sure that we're meeting the country's energy security needs.\u201d\n\nSpeaking ahead of the tour, Mayor Gary McCarthy, a Democrat, said Schenectady is a partner in making the region competitive.\n\n\u201cWe look at GE as a partner, and that I've always wanted to do whatever we can do to make sure that this facility is globally competitive in it is sometimes a challenge, but I want to put that message out again today,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe talent that is in this building, the products that are coming out of this building are world changing, and everybody should pat themselves on the back for being part of that.\u201d\n\nGE has four locations in the Capital Region including Rotterdam and Saratoga with more than 1.7 million square feet of manufacturing space in Schenectady alone.",

The S&P 500 Index yields just 1.3% right now, on average.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of high dividend stocks that have strong current yields above 4%, and also have secure dividend payouts that can grow over time.\n\nThe following 3 dividend stocks have high dividend yields and safe payouts, which makes them attractive for retirement income.\n\nPortland General Electric (POR)\n\nPortland General Electric is an electric utility based in Portland, Oregon, providing electricity to more than 930,000 customers in 51 cities. The company owns or contracts more than 3.5 gigawatts of energy generation, between gas, coal, wind & solar, and hydro.\n\nPOR has about 3,000 full-time employees. In 2023, the corporation generated $2.9 billion in revenue. The utility company is diversified by customer, with 37% of retail deliveries going to residential customers, 34% to commercial clients, and 29% to industrial clients. The company is forecasting that 80% of its power delivered to customers by 2030 will be carbon free, and 100% carbon free by 2040. On April 19th, 2024, Portland General Electric announced a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share.\n\nPortland General reported third quarter 2024 results on October 25th, 2024. The company reported net income of $94 million for the quarter, equal to $0.90 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, compared to $0.46 in Q3 2023. Retail energy deliveries rose 0.3% year-to-date compared to the same prior year period, but wholesale energy deliveries soared 45%. As a result, total energy deliveries rose 11%.\n\nCompany management upgraded the company\u2019s long-term EPS growth guidance to 5% to 7% (from 4% to 6% previously), but from here we expect 4.5% earnings growth into 2029. As of October 2024, Portland General maintained that long-term guidance. Leadership also estimates that the company can grow the dividend by 5% to 7% over the long term, for a 6% mid-point, which is consistent with the trailing 10-year average dividend growth rate of 5.8%.\n\nWe expect that Portland General will generate this earnings growth through increased annual energy deliveries, as a result of commercial growth, and strong growth in industrial energy demand due to customer expansion. Rate increases, customer additions, and completion of construction projects will all further fuel Portland General\u2019s earnings growth.\n\nPOR yields 4.8%.\n\nT. Rowe Price Group (TROW)\n\nT. Rowe Price Group is one of the largest publicly traded asset managers. The company provides a broad array of mutual funds, sub-advisory services, and separate account management for individual and institutional investors, retirement plans and financial intermediaries. The firm had assets under management of more than $1.6 trillion as of September 30th, 2024.\n\nT. Rowe Price is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its dividend for 38 years in a row.\n\nOn November 1st, 2024, T. Rowe Price reported third quarter results for the period September June 30th, 2024. For the quarter, revenue grew 6.9% to $1.79 billion, though this was $60 million below estimates. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $2.57 compared favorably to $2.17 in the prior year and was $0.22 more than expected.\n\nDuring the quarter, assets under management (AUM) improved $61.8 billion, or 3.9%, to $1.63 trillion. Market appreciation of $74 billion was partially offset by $12.2 billion of net client outflows. Operating expenses of $1.17 billion increased 7.6% year-over-year, but just 0.3% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nT. Rowe Price\u2019s earnings, as well as its dividends, have grown substantially over the last decade. While earnings did drop during the last financial crisis, the overall record has been solid. Since 2014, the company has grown earnings-per-share by an average compound rate of 5.9% per annum. Moreover, the company performed well in 2020.\n\nAsset managers like T. Rowe have low variable costs. As a result, higher revenues, driven primarily by increasing assets under management, allow for margin expansion and attractive earnings growth rates. Assets under management grow in two basic ways: increased contributions and higher underlying asset values. While asset values are finicky, the trend is upward over the long-term.\n\nOn the contribution side, T. Rowe Price\u2019s strong past performance is a key selling point and could attract customers going forward. In addition, T. Rowe has another EPS growth lever in the way of share repurchases.\n\nTROW stock currently yields 4.3%.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS)\n\nGeneral Mills is a packaged food giant, with more than 100 brands and operations in more than 100 countries. General Mills has not cut its dividend for 124 consecutive years. It has returned to growth mode in the last five years, mostly thanks to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and the pandemic, which greatly increased food consumption at home.\n\nOn September 12th, 2024, General Mills announced that it agreed to sell its North American yogurt business for $2.1 billion in cash. The proceeds will be used for share repurchases. The sale of this business, which generated 8% of total sales last year, is expected to reduce earnings-per-share by ~3% in the first year after the sale.\n\nIn mid-December, General Mills reported (12/18/24) results for Q2-2025. Net sales and organic sales grew 2% and 1%, respectively, over last year\u2019s quarter thanks to higher volumes, which more than offset a slight decline in the price due to the composition of the product mix.\n\nThis marked an improvement vs. the marginal decline reported in the previous quarter. Gross margin expanded from 34.4% to 36.9%, as cost savings offset input inflation. Adjusted earnings-per-share grew 12%, from $1.25 to $1.40, and exceeded the analysts\u2019 consensus by $0.18.\n\nGeneral Mills has grown its earnings-per-share at a 5.2% average annual rate in the last decade. In recent years, this decelerated, but the company has accelerated again since the onset of the pandemic. We expect approximately 5.0% annual earnings-per-share growth over the next five years, mostly thanks to Blue Buffalo. Earnings-per-share will also benefit from a decent amount of share repurchases.\n\nGIS stock currently yields 4.0%.\n\nDisclosure: No positions in any stocks mentioned\n\n_______________\n\n\n\nBob Ciura has worked at Sure Dividend since October 2016.

Nonetheless, it's worthwhile to consider how CEOs outside of tech have been able to pull off turnarounds some doubted were possible, he said in a review of several executives who managed to earn back investors' trust.\n\nBrinker International's CEO Kevin Hochman, for example, caught Cramer's attention when the former KFC executive took the helm. The CEO was able to improve its most popular franchise, Chili's, with a simplified menu, a better value proposition and advertising strategy. Since Hochman started at Brinker, shares have soared, Cramer added. He also pointed to another food and beverage name, Starbucks, whose stock has jumped since Brian Niccol took over as CEO. Cramer noted that Niccol lead a successful turnaround at Chipotle and it seems he can do the same for Starbucks.\n\nCramer also mentioned Larry Culp, who he said managed to transform the old General Electric by splitting it into three businesses, GE Aerospace, GE Healthcare and GE Vernova. Cramer added that he thinks GE Vernova in particular is gaining momentum among investors. VF Corp's Bracken Darrell was also able to right the ship at the clothing company, Cramer continued. Darrell's sale of popular brands raised cash that enabled VF Corp to report a great quarter, he added.\n\n\"In some\u2014not all situations, but some\u2014that is all that matters if you want to make huge amounts of money,\" he said. \"The transcendence of the enterprise thanks to the leadership of a great CEO.\"\n\nGE Vernova declined to comment.

($160 million), and Schenectady, N.Y. ($50 million), in order manufacture up to 80 heavy-duty gas turbines annually.\n\nOne of the largest investments will be a nearly $100-million program to improve the electrification and carbon research programs underway at the GE Vernova Advanced Research Center in Niskayuna, N.Y. That program also covers talent recruitment and research into direct air capture technologies, alternative fuels for power generation, \u201cthe grid of the future,\u201d and critical infrastructure security.\n\nGE Vernova also plans to invest close to $50 million at plants in Parsippany, N.J., and Bangor, Me., to increase capacity, improve product quality, and enhance delivery efforts.\n\nGE also will invest nearly $20 million to expand its Grid Solutions plants in Charleroi, Penn., which manufactures switchgear, and Clearwater, Fla., to produce switchgears, capacitors and instrument transformers. The investment is expected to result in a total of more than 260 new jobs at the two facilities. The investments are critical to meet rising demand for critical high-voltage grid equipment. The majority of the investment is planned for the installation of new assets to create additional capacity and improve productivity.\n\nIn addition, the company\u2019s Wind segment will invest nearly $100 million in manufacturing plants for onshore wind turbines in Pensacola, Fla., Schenectady, and Grand Forks, N.D., and its remanufacturing facilities in Amarillo, Tex.\n\nThe GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy joint venture will invest over $50 million to expand automation at its Wilmington, N.C., plant, where it expects to launch manufacturing for its new BWRX-300 small modular reactor system.\n\nLast, the U.S. investments will include a more than $10-million program at a Pittsburgh plant, including planned funding for a new manufacturing line for the Flexinverter technology, for utility-scale solar and energy storage applications.",

Without this, bankruptcy is inevitable.\n\nFor the automakers embarked on the electric transformation of their portfolio, this represents a major challenge. We've often heard brands complaining that they were losing money on the sale of each electric model, both for the simple manufacturing operation and for the investments made in this new technology.\n\nProfitability would come, we were told. At General Motors (GM), the first such forecast was for 2023. The pandemic changed all that.\n\nCadillac Escalade IQ | Photo: Cadillac\n\nYesterday, GM shared its financial results for the 2024 year, and in addition to reporting a 9 percent increase in sales, the company was proud to say that its electric model range presented a positive balance sheet in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThere is a nuance, however.\n\nThe company refers to \u201cpositive variable earnings\u201d. This comes with a slight caveat. That definition, as reported by Reuters, means that revenues from electric vehicle sales were higher than fixed costs, which includes money spent on the labour required to build the models and the materials needed to assemble them.\n\nWhat is not considered are the costs associated with the creation of new assembly lines, so the massive investments involved in reorganizing electric vehicle plants are excluded from the equation.\n\nEven so, GM's announcement is an important step forward. Once the investment costs have been amortized, the vehicles will all generate profits, which is excellent news for the long term.\n\nAlso to consider is the active 2024 year GM had. The company introduced several models to the market, doubling its market share in the EV sector. The American giant offers eight models, with more expected in 2025, notably the Cadillac Vistiq and Optiq.\n\nOf course, we'll have to keep a close eye on the performance of products already on the market, with subsidies being withdrawn in both Canada and the U.S.",

            "content": "A utility company wants to cut through 5 acres of mature Doug fir and big leaf maples in a massive Portland urban forest to make way for new transmission lines.\n\nForest Park spans 5,200 acres in the Tualatin Mountains of Northwest Portland. One of the largest urban parks in the United States, it provides important habitat for vulnerable species, particularly Northern red-legged frogs \u2014 as well as more than 80 miles of trails for Portlanders seeking easy nearby access to the wilderness.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nFILE - Tucked into the northwest corner of Portland, Ore., the Wildwood Trail weaves for more than 30 miles through Forest Park. Bradley W. Parks / OPB\n\nPortland General Electric executives say the company needs to improve its infrastructure to meet Portland\u2019s electricity demands, particularly as it moves away from fossil fuels and prepares the grid to carry more renewably generated power.\n\nThe company plans to meet that goal by removing 400 trees through intact, mature forest to install new power poles and 1,400 feet of transmission lines. The proposal has drawn fierce opposition from environmental groups, as well as the city of Portland itself.\n\nThat opposition was on display during a public hearing Wednesday, where city staff recommended a hearings officer deny PGE\u2019s plan. A decision is expected in early March.\n\nPortland environmental planner Morgan Steele said PGE failed to meet \u201cseveral approval criteria,\u201d including a construction plan that minimizes environmental impacts.\n\nEarlier this month, the city permitting department issued a report highlighting multiple other flaws in PGE\u2019s plan. The report showed at least two other alternatives PGE could pursue that would avoid cutting hundreds of trees in Forest Park.\n\nStaff also worried about future phases of PGE\u2019s project, which could impact another 15 acres of Forest Park.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nPortland General Electric plans to install and upgrade transmission lines in Portland's Forest Park, marked here as the blue and orange dotted lines. The project entails removing about 400 trees between these two lines. Image courtesy of Portland General Electric\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, PGE officials criticized Portland\u2019s report for including \u201copposition testimony\u201d from environmental groups and neighborhood associations.\n\n\u201cAt its essence, the staff report is based on a flawed premise that Forest Park is a hands-off time capsule that must be protected from impacts at all costs,\u201d PGE attorney David Peterson said.\n\nAccording to the Portland staff report, the area the company intends to log is mostly free of invasive species, except near the forest edges of existing transmission line corridors.\n\nTo mitigate its environmental impact, PGE says it will plant a variety of tree species in the project area, including over 300 Oregon white oaks and 400 other plant species. It\u2019s unclear how the company will conduct this work, or how it will ensure the new trees take root and survive.\n\nPGE staff said removing old trees from this forest will benefit it in the long run, since they will plant native oaks instead of conifers, which tend to dominate and shade out other tree species.\n\n\u201cSo this is good mitigation,\u201d company senior project manager Randy Franks said. \u201cIt addresses a crucial and critical need to expand and conserve oak habitat.\u201d\n\nPGE will also pay fees to Portland Parks and Recreation \u2014 amounting to about $2.5 million \u2014 to go toward the bureau\u2019s conservation work in Forest Park.\n\nDuring a watch party on Wednesday at Sierra Club's Oregon chapter office in Portland, chapter director Damon Motz-Storey writes on white boards where people can sign up to testify. Jan. 29, 2025, in Portland, Ore. April Ehrlich / OPB\n\nA few dozen people gathered at the Sierra Club\u2019s Oregon chapter office Wednesday to watch a live stream of the virtual hearing. Some attendees said they feared PGE\u2019s project primarily benefits energy-heavy data centers, not every day Portlanders.\n\n\u201cHearing them talk about how this would somehow be good for the environment \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy it,\u201d said Saoirse Cox, who watched from the Sierra Club\u2019s office. \u201cI just think this is another instance of profit being prioritized over the people and over the planet.\u201d",

            "content": "The U.S. Air Force has dramatically plussed-up contracts with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, both of which now have a ceiling of $3.5 billion, to continue work on prototype next-generation jet engines. To date, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program has been focused primarily on developing new engines to power a new sixth-generation crewed stealth \u2018fighter\u2019 in the works as part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative. The NGAD combat jet\u2019s future is now an open question, but NGAP might also feed into other advanced aviation programs.\n\nThe Pentagon announced the modifications to the existing NGAP deals in its daily contracting notice today. Both are described as funding additional \u201ctechnology maturation and risk reduction services\u201d in support of work on prototype engines.\n\nA notional sixth-generation stealth combat jet. Collins Aerospace\n\nThe specific entry for the modification to the NGAP contract with Pratt & Whitney (a subsidiary of Raytheon) provides the following additional context:\n\n\u201cThe work includes design, analysis, rig testing, prototype engine build and testing, and weapon system integration. The contract modification is for the execution of the prototype phase of the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program and is focused on delivering a state-of-the-art propulsion system with a flexible architecture that can be tailored for future combat aircraft operating across various mission threads; and digitally transforming the propulsion industrial base.\u201d\n\nAn engine test rig at the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in 2017 used to support work on Pratt & Whitney\u2019s XA101 engine. The company is leveraging work on the XA101 for its NGAP design. USAF\n\nThe U.S. Air Force first awarded the NGAP contracts to General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in 2022. At that time, additional NGAP contracts also went to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, the three prime contractors vying at that point to develop the NGAD combat jet, to help ensure the next-generation engines would be compatible with their respective designs. Each of those deals had an initial ceiling of close to $1 billion.\n\nDetails about the NGAP designs from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, known as the XA102 and XA103, respectively, remain limited. The XA102 passed a major design review in 2023 and the XA103 did the same last year. They both leverage work on earlier engines that the two companies developed as potential options for re-engining F-35 Joint Strike Fighters as part of the Air Force\u2019s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP). In 2023, the Air Force announced its intention to cancel AETP in favor of upgrading the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine currently used on all variants of the F-35. Congress subsequently authorized additional funding for AETP.\n\nAn old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, regarding the AETP effort. USAF An old Air Force briefing slide, dating back to at least 2018, that shows potential benefits that could be released through the AETP program and follow-on efforts for various aircraft types, including a future advanced combat jet. USAF\n\nLike the XA100 and XA101, the XA102 and XA103 are known to be so-called adaptive cycle designs. What this means in broad strokes is that their bypass ratios can be adjusted on demand while in flight between modes that are more fuel-efficient or provide more power, depending on what the situation requires. For instance, a tactical jet with such an engine could fly in an \u2018efficiency\u2019 mode to an operating area, helping to conserve fuel for when it gets on station, which might include time in a higher-power combat-focused mode. The capabilities adaptive cycle engines offer could be particularly important in a future large-scale conflict, especially one against China across the board expanses of the Pacific, where aerial refueling assets are expected to be increasingly at risk and available bases could be few and far between.\n\nGeneral Electric has previously said that its earlier XA100 design is some 25 percent more efficient than the F135 and can also offer between 10 and 20 percent more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney engine in certain flight profiles. You can read more about the XA100 and adaptive cycle technologies here.\n\nDespite the new funding, what any future NGAP engine might power is less clear than it was back in 2022. The Air Force launched a deep review of its NGAD combat jet plans last year and it remains unclear how the service under the new Trump administration will proceed. A number of alternatives to the original concept, envisioned as a relatively large and expensive successor to the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter but with an overall different mission set, have been proposed, including a truncated lower-cost design viewed more as a follow-on to the F-35 with a focus on acting as an aerial drone controller.\n\nNGAP engines, or derivatives thereof, could still power the NGAD combat jet regardless of its final form. Members of a next-generation family of jet engines, or technologies therefrom, could find their way into other advanced Air Force crewed and uncrewed aircraft, as well. The service is actively working to acquire new Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones and is also eyeing stealthy aerial refueling tankers, though the future of those efforts has also been called into question primarily due to concerns about affordability. The Air Force\u2019s budget outlook is complicated by a number of very high-priority, but also very expensive programs, including the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. The ballooning cost of Sentinel was a key factor in the decision to initiate the NGAD combat jet review.\n\nOther branches of the U.S. military could be interested in the NGAP engines or related designs. While the future of the NGAD combat jet is murky, the U.S. Navy has insisted that it will push ahead with its own plans for a sixth-generation carrier-capable stealth \u2018fighter\u2019 commonly referred to now as F/A-XX. At the same time, in an interview with Aviation Week last year, the Navy did say it was looking to chart a course for F/A-XX independent of Air Force efforts, including NGAP.\n\nA rendering of notional U.S. Navy sixth-generation combat jets flying past an aircraft carrier. Boeing\n\nAt the same time, any engines that might come out of NGAP still look to be a ways off. The contract modifications announced today for the ongoing prototyping effort now cover work through 2032.\n\nWhatever ultimately comes of NGAP, the expanded deals with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney show the Air Force is still very committed now to seeing the development of the XA102 and XA103 through to at least the prototype stage.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

The chief executive officer of Tesla, X, SpaceX and several other companies is the world\u2019s richest person and considered to be the second-most powerful figure in the Trump administration.\n\nMoments after Trump took the oath of office, he announced several measures that could greatly damage Michigan\u2019s auto industry and the state\u2019s overall economy.\n\nThe new president said he intends to slap a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, and possibly a 10% tariff on China on Feb. 1. And he issued an executive order on energy policy that could result in the billions of dollars Detroit automakers have spent to develop electric vehicles going up in smoke.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump was flanked by the chief executive officers of tech firms SoftBank, Oracle and OpenA1 in announcing \u201cStargate,\u201d an artificial intelligence infrastructure project that could cost up to $500 billion and create as many as 100,000 U.S. jobs.\n\n(It should be noted that Musk, who reportedly despises OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, threw cold water on the planned project.)\n\nTrump also reversed an executive order by his predecessor, President Joe Biden that established AI safety and security guardrails for the fast-growing technology, a sign of the major influence the tech industry is building in the new administration.\n\nAll these events of the past few days have left Michigan\u2019s auto industry leaders scrambling over how to respond to a trade and regulatory climate that is suddenly far different from it was before January 20.\n\nTrump\u2019s moves on tariffs and energy policy weren\u2019t a surprise. But they present a significant challenge to an auto industry that is grappling with vehicle affordability issues, costly investments in new technologies and toughening global competition.\n\nAnd Trump may be better positioned to carry out policy proposals that don\u2019t exactly favor the auto industry than he was in his first term.\n\n\u201cHe understands Washington now,\u201d said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, which promotes the state\u2019s auto industry.\n\nPlus, Republicans who have shown little inclination to denounce even Trump\u2019s most outrageous acts, control the House and Senate.\n\nMichAuto issued a statement shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration saying tariffs could weaken American competitiveness, disrupt supply chains and shrink investments by companies uncertain over the direction of trade policies.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the increased cost of doing business between the U.S. and Canada could be especially acute, even as the new Gordie Howe Bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor is set to open this year,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTariffs could protect Michigan companies from tough foreign competition in the short term. But other countries will retaliate with their own tariffs, and the cost of vehicles and other goods will rise at a time when Trump has promised to bring prices down.\n\n\u201cThose things generally outweigh protection from tariffs,\u201d University of Michigan economist Gabe Ehrlich said during a presentation at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. \u201cWe won\u2019t get protection for the auto industry without paying a price.\u201d\n\nStevens said it\u2019s possible that the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, if enacted, might not come as soon as February 1 because Trump often uses imprecise language that leaves him wiggle room in meeting self-imposed deadlines.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of rhetoric and posturing,\u201d Stevens told me. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping calmer heads prevail.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Trump\u2019s energy policies will impact Detroit automakers\u2019 gradual transition to electric vehicles. Analysts believe the Detroit Three will continue their EV push because that\u2019s where the global auto industry is headed. But he has already announced moves designed to ensure the continued dominance of gas-powered cars and trucks over EVs, threatening the business case for new technology vehicles.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order on energy revokes a Biden order that set a goal of having 50% of all cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. be electric, hybrid or fuel cell vehicles by 2030.\n\nThe order also calls for a variety of anti-EV actions, including pausing all spending in the Inflation Reduction Act related to EVs and eliminating any incentives that favor EVs over other technologies. America\u2019s energy policy will be fossil fuel-based, climate change be damned, the president asserted.\n\n\u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address.\n\nThere is one hopeful sign for automakers. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters earlier this month that Trump called him \u201cout of the blue\u201d to discuss the industry.\n\nFord said he came away from that conversation confident the industry will have \u201ca seat at the table\u201d as the administration develops economic policy details. Stevens said that\u2019s crucial.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: when you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d he said.\n\nHopefully not all the seats have already been taken by the tech bros.",

The contract will support the execution of the prototype phase, including the design, analysis, and testing of the engines, alongside weapon system integration.\n\nThe goal is to deliver a propulsion system with a flexible architecture that is adaptable to future aircraft and able to handle various mission types while also allowing a digital transformation within the propulsion industry.\n\nThe Pentagon stated that no funds were being disbursed to either company at the time of the award.\n\nIn August 2022, the US Air Force first awarded the NGAP contracts to GE Aerospace, Raytheon\u2019s Pratt & Whitney, Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop Grumman, with each allocated US$975 million to launch NGAP technology-maturation and risk-reduction initiatives.\n\nWith the announcement on January 27, the total contract value for each company rose to US$3.5 billion, and the list of vendors is now reduced to only GE and Pratt & Whitney.\n\nEarlier, the focus was primarily on powering a next-generation fighter jet designed to be a successor to the F-22 Raptor.\n\nHowever, a range of alternative concepts have since been proposed, including lower-cost designs and configurations aimed at filling different roles\u2014such as increasing the capabilities of the F-35 or even functioning as an aerial drone controller.\n\nNGAP Program\n\nThe Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program is an initiative by the US Air Force focused on developing advanced propulsion systems for future military aircraft.\n\nThe program aims to create engines with improved fuel efficiency, enhanced survivability, and robust power and thermal management.\n\nJill Albertelli, President of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, previously underscored the importance of this technology for maintaining air superiority.\n\nAlbertelli said, \u201cThis technology is critical to maintaining air superiority, which is why Pratt & Whitney has made significant investments in research and development and advanced manufacturing.\u201d\n\nInformation regarding the specific designs of the NGAP engines, General Electric\u2019s XA102 and Pratt & Whitney\u2019s XA103, remains sparse. The XA102 completed a significant design review in 2023, while the XA103 followed suit in 2024.\n\nThe Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program builds upon the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), a joint initiative with Pratt & Whitney and GE Aviation.\n\nAs part of the Air Force\u2019s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), the two companies worked on developing potential engine options to upgrade the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nIn 2023, the Air Force shifted its focus away from the AETP, opting instead to upgrade the existing Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, which powers the entire F-35 fleet. Despite this change, Congress later approved further funding to ensure that AETP development would proceed.\n\nThe XA102 and XA103 engines, like the XA100 and XA101, feature adaptive cycle technology. This means their bypass ratios can be adjusted dynamically in flight to optimize fuel efficiency or provide additional thrust as needed.\n\nFor example, a tactical aircraft with this type of engine could operate in an efficient mode during transit to conserve fuel, switching to a higher-power mode once reaching its target area.\n\nThese adaptive cycle engines are expected to be vital in future large-scale conflicts, particularly in regions like the Pacific, where aerial refueling assets may be increasingly vulnerable and forward-operating bases may be limited.\n\nGeneral Electric has previously stated that its XA100 engine is 25% more fuel-efficient than the F135 and provides 10-20% more thrust in certain flight profiles.\n\nDespite the ambiguity surrounding the future of the NGAD combat jet, the investments in NGAP continue. The next-generation engines and related technologies developed under the program could still form the backbone of future crewed and uncrewed aircraft in the Air Force\u2019s arsenal.",

            "content": "General Electric ((GE)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nGeneral Electric\u2019s recent earnings call for 2024 conveyed a sense of optimism, grounded in the company\u2019s impressive financial performance. Despite some supply chain hurdles, GE Aerospace demonstrated resilience, with significant growth in revenue, profit, and cash flow. The leadership\u2019s confidence was bolstered by a robust demand for its products and strategic initiatives that appear to be paying off. The outlook for 2025 remains positive, with expectations for continued growth across key financial metrics.\n\nRecord Orders and Revenue Growth\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, GE Aerospace achieved record orders with a 46% increase, while revenue grew by 16%, driven by double-digit growth in both services and equipment. For the full year, revenue saw a 10% increase, with profit rising by 30% to $7.3 billion, underscoring the company\u2019s strong market position.\n\nStrong Free Cash Flow\n\nGE Aerospace reported a 21% increase in free cash flow in Q4, and nearly 30% for the entire year, reaching $6.1 billion. The company achieved a conversion rate exceeding 120%, highlighting its efficient cash management and operational effectiveness.\n\nImpressive Growth in Commercial Engines & Services\n\nThe commercial engines and services segment exhibited impressive growth, with Q4 orders up by 50%, revenue increasing by 19%, and profit soaring by 44%.

            "content": "Chevron\u2019s announcement is the latest example of just how much the promise of A.I. \u2014 a voracious electricity consumer \u2014 is reshaping the economy. Oil producers are recalibrating their strategies and leaning into power generation, a business that many of them had previously sworn off because it was much less profitable than drilling and processing oil and gas. Just last month, Exxon said that it, too, wanted to get into the business of selling electricity to data centers.\n\nBut in a reminder that the prospects for A.I. data centers and growing electricity demand are highly uncertain, technology and energy stocks tumbled on Monday. Investors were unnerved by the stunning advances in A.I. made by an unfamiliar Chinese start-up, DeepSeek, that said it had made its gains using a modest number of computer chips that consumed relatively little energy. Shares of chip-maker Nvidia tumbled 17 percent and the stock of Constellation Energy, a large power producer, closed down more than 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the potential for markets to surprise you,\u201d Mr. Wirth said. But he added that being early to market and keeping its costs low would protect Chevron against the possibility that power demand growth falls short of current expectations.\n\nHis company is hardly alone.\n\nMany power producers are bulking up, and many are investing in natural gas generating capacity specifically. Constellation, which has a large fleet of nuclear power plants, agreed this month to buy rival Calpine, which owns many natural gas plants, for $16.4 billion. And last week, NextEra Energy said it was planning to build more gas-fueled power plants.\n\nExpectations for how much and how quickly U.S. electricity demand will rise vary widely. What\u2019s clear is that data centers are likely to consume a lot more of the country\u2019s power than they do today. A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that the facilities are poised to use up to 12 percent of U.S. electricity in 2028, up from 4.4 percent in 2023.",

            "content": "General Motors passed a major milestone in its efforts to make its electric vehicles profitable.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said EVs were \"variable profit positive\" in 2024.\n\nGM built 189,000 EVs last year and aims to build 300,000 this year.\n\nGeneral Motors is finally making some money in the electric-vehicle business.\n\nThe automaker reported its EVs were \"variable profit positive\" in 2024, meaning that they earned more money than GM spent on manufacturing costs such as labor and parts.\n\nGM doesn't break out its EV earnings like Ford does, so there are likely still other costs that it needs to overcome to achieve full EV profitability, including the cost of adding assembly lines. Still, the triumph over manufacturing costs marks an important milestone.\n\nDespite the achievement \u2014 and overall results that topped analyst expectations for the fourth quarter \u2014 its shares fell more than 10% in trading Tuesday amid investor concern over the new Trump administration's effect on the automotive industry.\n\nA long road to EV profitability with one major potential speed bump\n\nGM has long been a leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with early offerings like the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid and the Bolt battery-electric vehicle. GM committed to a fully electric future in 2017, a promise executives stood by even as EV sales hit a plateau.\n\nIt's not easy to profit from EVs given the high costs associated with development and materials. In fact, GM's legacy competitors are still losing billions of dollars on EVs. Ford recorded losses of $1.2 billion in the third quarter alone. Ford is set to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results next week.\n\nSo far, the only company to make money from electric-vehicle sales in the US is Elon Musk's Tesla, which first turned a profit in 2020 after years of major losses. But even Musk's profitability has been threatened by an industrywide slowdown in EV sales over the past two years.\n\nThe automotive industry continues to struggle with a rapid change in demand for EVs, driven by a new cohort of shoppers who are less interested in the large, expensive EVs companies previously counted on to usher them into profitability.\n\nLast year, GM took a risky approach to this shift, flooding the zone with more EV offerings aimed at average customers, while its competitors pulled back. In the end, GM fell just short of its production goal of 200,000 EVs for the year, producing 189,000 battery-powered cars.\n\nThe company has upped its production goal this year to 300,000 EVs, but GM CFO Paul Jacobson told reporters Tuesday morning that the company would continue to respond to changes in demand and economic policy.\n\nThe automotive industry faces a lot of uncertainty under the Trump administration. The president has threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which could be very costly for the sector. And when it comes to electric vehicles, Trump has floated the idea of pulling back on government incentives that have been critical for EV adoption in recent years.",

            "content": "As the first earnings cycle of 2025 is ramping up, so are the announcements of new share buyback authorizations. Among these announcements, three big-name U.S. stocks stick out so far, all of which also posted impressive Q4 2024 earnings. All return and percentage of market capitalization figures use data as of the Jan. 23 close.\n\nGet Netflix alerts: Sign Up\n\nNetflix: Adds Millions of Subscribers, Billions in Buyback Authorization\n\nNetflix Today NFLX Netflix $890.17 -29.51 (-3.21%) 52-Week Range $542.01 \u25bc $1,064.50 P/E Ratio 44.89 Price Target $1,014.26 Add to Watchlist\n\nAlong with its earnings report that saw the addition of 19 million subscribers, the largest increase in its history, Netflix NASDAQ: NFLX also announced a sizable share buyback authorization. The repurchase program allows the company to buy back up to $15 billion of its own stock. Netflix now has $17.1 billion in buyback authority at its fingertips, allowing the company to return capital to shareholders strategically. This $17.1 billion authorization represents 4.2% of the company\u2019s value.\n\nThis recent buyback program is significantly larger than the $10 billion program Netflix announced in Q3 2023. However, as a percentage of the company\u2019s value, it is significantly smaller. Since that 2023 announcement, shares are up over 184%. Meanwhile, the buyback authorization is only 33% larger.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX) Price Chart for Friday, March, 14, 2025\n\nThe company's continued share buybacks, despite a big price rise, may signal that management sees more upside in the company. Netflix's recent subscription price hikes and low churn are encouraging. So are its live sports opportunities and ad revenue growth. All are reasons to be optimistic about the stock.\n\nGE Aerospace: Earnings, Buybacks, and Everything in Between Up in Q4\n\nGeneral Electric Today GE General Electric $192.28 -2.72 (-1.40%) 52-Week Range $131.91 \u25bc $212.19 Dividend Yield 0.75% P/E Ratio 32.10 Price Target $211.31 Add to Watchlist\n\nGeneral Electric NYSE: GE, also known as GE Aerospace, is another hot stock that announced a buyback program as it beat earnings. The company blew past estimates for both sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Revenue increased by 16%, total orders increased by 46%, and the company over doubled its adjusted EPS from Q4 2023. GE Aerospace is one of three stocks that emerged from a corporate restructuring of legacy conglomerate General Electric. The other two are GE HealthCare Technologies NASDAQ: GEHC and GE Vernova NYSE: GEV. GE Aerospace retained the ticker traditionally used by General Electric. It is a key supplier of jet engines to firms like Boeing NYSE: BA and Airbus EPA: AIR.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) Price Chart for Friday, March, 14, 2025\n\nAfter returning more than $6 billion to shareholders in 2024, GE Aerospace announced a $6 billion buyback program on Jan. 23. This represents just under 3% of the company\u2019s market capitalization. That wasn\u2019t all the good news in terms of returning capital to shareholders. The company also announced it is increasing its dividend by a hefty 30%. This would bump the company\u2019s annual dividend payments up from $1.12 per share to $1.46 per share. That still only gives the company a dividend yield of 0.7%; however, it is still a nice bump. It gets the company closer to the 1.2% dividend yield of the S&P 500.\n\nCitigroup: Massive Buyback Authorization Combined with Nearly $3 Billion in Profit\n\nCitigroup Today C Citigroup $67.12 -0.83 (-1.21%) 52-Week Range $53.51 \u25bc $84.74 Dividend Yield 3.34% P/E Ratio 11.28 Price Target $83.93 Add to Watchlist\n\nAlong with also releasing fantastic earnings, Citigroup NYSE: C announced a buyback authorization worth tens of billions. The company\u2019s $20 billion authorization follows its return of $7 billion to shareholders in 2024. The authorization is by far the biggest of these three firms, representing a sizable 13% of the company\u2019s market capitalization. The large size of this dividend program may indicate that the company plans to move away from its historically low buyback activity. Over the last 12 months, ended in Q3, Citigroup spent $2.5 billion on buybacks. This sits massively below the company\u2019s average last-12-month buyback purchasing of $5.5 billion over the past 20 years. Exact buyback figures for Q4 are not yet available.\n\nCitigroup Inc. (C) Price Chart for Friday, March, 14, 2025\n\nMarkets love what they\u2019ve seen from Citigroup so far this year, with the company\u2019s share price up by 16%. It was one of many bank stocks that had great quarters, helped by a pickup in investment banking activity. The company\u2019s investment banking revenues grew 35%. It also flipped the table on net income. It lost $1.8 billion in the final quarter of 2023, which shifted to a gain of $2.9 billion in Q4 2024. Citigroup is also deep in the process of cutting jobs as it works to become a leaner organization. The company cut 10,000 jobs last year, putting it halfway toward reaching its goal of 20,000 cuts by the end of 2026.\n\nBefore you consider Netflix, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Netflix wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Netflix currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "General Motors Takes Aim at Electric Vehicle Leadership\n\nAs electric vehicle (EV) competition heats up, General Motors (GM) is strategically positioning itself to challenge the current frontrunner, Tesla. With a significant boost in EV sales, especially with the introduction of the Equinox EV, GM is reshaping its approach to make electric cars more affordable.\n\nKurt Kelty, a seasoned expert who previously worked at Tesla, has joined GM to enhance its battery strategy. His experience is crucial, as he aims to reduce battery costs\u2014the primary expense in EV production. GM\u2019s ambitious plan involves establishing a domestic battery supply chain, modeled after successful practices in China, to vertically integrate its operations in North America.\n\nIn line with its affordability goal, GM is set to launch the redesigned Bolt, which is anticipated to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, priced considerably lower than many current electric options. This strategic focus on lower price points is expected to attract a new wave of buyers who previously viewed EVs as unattainable.\n\nGM\u2019s efforts are also reflected in its latest offerings, including the Cadillac Optiq and Lyriq, expanding its EV lineup and catering to both mainstream and premium markets. With the removal of federal incentives for electric vehicle purchases, making affordable models is crucial for GM\u2019s success. As the landscape of the EV market continues to evolve, GM\u2019s commitment to affordability could redefine its position and stem the tide against Tesla\u2019s dominance.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle Revolution: A Broader Perspective\n\nThe shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) heralds profound implications for society, culture, and the global economy. As major automakers like General Motors (GM) intensify their efforts to dominate this burgeoning market, the impacts will resonate far beyond mere consumer choices.\n\nCultural attitudes toward sustainable transportation are undergoing a seismic shift. As EVs become more accessible, society is progressively embracing electric mobility as a viable alternative, fostering a cultural norm that prioritizes sustainability and technological advancement. The democratization of EVs through lower-cost models such as the redesigned Bolt not only expands consumer access but also encourages a wider acceptance of eco-friendly practices.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, GM\u2019s investment in domestic battery production promises to create new jobs and revitalize the manufacturing sector in North America. The establishment of a comprehensive battery supply chain could stimulate local economies and reduce reliance on foreign imports, fortifying national self-sufficiency in tech innovation.\n\nMoreover, the environmental ramifications cannot be understated. As the proliferation of affordable EVs leads to a decrease in fossil fuel dependency, emissions reductions could significantly combat climate change. However, this transition must be managed carefully; the demand for raw materials like lithium and cobalt raises concerns about sustainable sourcing and potential environmental degradation associated with mining practices.\n\nIn the long term, the commitment to EV affordability may set a precedent for other industries, prompting a cultural shift towards accessible clean technologies. As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability, the trajectory of the automotive sector will likely influence global energy policies and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2019 Bold EV Strategy: The Race Towards Affordable Electric Vehicles\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs the electric vehicle (EV) market accelerates, General Motors (GM) is rapidly shifting gears to challenge Tesla\u2019s position as a market leader. With a multitude of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing production efficiency and reducing costs, GM is betting on affordability to attract a new consumer base.\n\nKey Features and Innovations\n\n1. Affordable Vehicle Lineup: GM\u2019s push for affordability is evidenced by the upcoming redesigned Bolt, which is designed to cater to budget-conscious consumers. The pricing strategy aims to make electric vehicles more accessible, particularly as federal incentives are being phased out.\n\n2. Battery Technology Advancements: With the appointment of Kurt Kelty, a former Tesla battery expert, GM is focused on reducing battery costs. This decision is pivotal as batteries constitute the most considerable expense in EV manufacturing. Kelty\u2019s expertise will play a vital role in improving GM\u2019s battery supply chain.\n\n3. Domestic Battery Supply Chain: GM\u2019s ambitious plan includes creating a domestic battery supply chain that mirrors successful approaches from China. This vertical integration aims to enhance efficiency and drive down costs, further promoting the affordability of EVs.\n\nPros and Cons of GM\u2019s EV Strategy\n\n\u2013 Pros:\n\n\u2013 Increased affordability could expand the consumer base significantly.\n\n\u2013 Innovations in battery technology may lead to better performance and lower production costs.\n\n\u2013 A diverse EV lineup, including models like the Cadillac Optiq and Lyriq, can capture both mainstream and premium markets.\n\n\u2013 Cons:\n\n\u2013 Transitioning to a new supply chain may face challenges and delays.\n\n\u2013 Competition remains fierce, with Tesla and other automakers continuously innovating.\n\n\u2013 A focus on affordability might sacrifice some advanced features that higher-end consumers desire.\n\nMarket Predictions and Trends\n\nAnalysts predict that GM\u2019s focus on affordability could redefine its market presence in the upcoming years. As electric vehicle adoption surges, the demand for cost-effective models is expected to rise, creating a favorable environment for GM\u2019s strategy.\n\nUse Cases for GM\u2019s Electric Vehicles\n\n1. Urban Commuting: The Bolt and Equinox EV are designed for city dwellers who require practical, cost-effective solutions for daily commutes.\n\n2. Families: The growing EV lineup, including spacious models, targets families seeking environmentally friendly options without compromising space or comfort.\n\n3. Environmental Initiatives: Consumers looking to reduce their carbon footprint can benefit from GM\u2019s affordable models, aligning with sustainability goals.\n\nLimitations and Considerations\n\nWhile GM\u2019s strategy positions it well in the competitive landscape, challenges such as fluctuating raw material costs and evolving consumer preferences could impact outcomes. Additionally, without federal incentives, the pressure to maintain affordability remains high.\n\nConclusion\n\nGeneral Motors is spearheading a transformative approach in the electric vehicle sector by emphasizing affordability and innovation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. If you experience issues with the webcast slides refreshing or there appears to be delays in the slide advancement, please hit F5 on your keyboard to refresh. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Blaire Shoor, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nBlaire Shoor: Thanks, Liz. Welcome to GE Aerospace\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call. I\u2019m joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Rahul Ghai. Many of the statements we\u2019re making are forward looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Additionally, Larry and Rahul, consistent with prior quarters, will speak to total company and corporate financial results and guidance today on a non-GAAP basis. Now, over to Larry.\n\nLarry Culp: Blaire, thank you. And good morning, everyone. Head of Investor Relations, that has a nice ring to it, Blaire. I hope everybody saw our announcement last week relative to Blaire\u2019s promotion. She\u2019s excited. We\u2019re excited. 2024 was a year for the history books at GE Aerospace. In April, we became a standalone public company, the culmination of GE\u2019s multi-year transformation. Nothing has been more front and center than our purpose: inventing the future of flight, lifting people up, and bringing them home safely. Those last four words remain our top priority with nearly 1 million passengers in flight at this very moment with our technology underwing. We launched FLIGHT DECK, our proprietary lean operating model, to better serve our customers through a relentless focus on safety, quality, delivery, and cost in that order.\n\nSeeing our teams in action through the year with FLIGHT DECK from Malaysia to Wales to Asheville and elsewhere truly was energizing. Commercial momentum continued as we signed several key services agreements and received orders for more than 4,600 commercial and defense engines. In narrow-bodies, this included American Airlines\u2019 commitment for 85 new Boeing 737 MAX jets powered by our LEAP-1B. In wide-bodies, we were honored to add a new GEnx customer, British Airways. And in defense, we received an order from the Polish Armed Forces for 210 T700 engines to power the 96 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters. To close the year, we received certification of the LEAP-1A HPT durability kit. Combined with the three prior durability enhancements that are performing well in the field, it\u2019s designed to increase LEAP time on wing by more than two-fold current levels and achieve parity with the CFM56\u2019s performance today.\n\nJust this week, in fact, we shipped our first retrofit engines to customers with the new hardware. It\u2019s also easier to produce supporting our output trajectory going forward. At the same time, we\u2019ve advanced significant technology milestones that will propel GE Aerospace into the future. Our RISE program with CFM completed more than 250 tests on our way to developing a full-scale open-fan engine. We recently announced that in collaboration with Boeing, NASA, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we will model the integration of an open-fan engine design on an aircraft wing. And our defense team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at 1 megawatt with the U.S. Army. This represents a meaningful increase in power generation, enabling us to advance hybrid electric propulsion applications.\n\nBut perhaps more important than what we accomplished in 2024 is how we did it. And my thanks this morning go out to our entire team for their unwavering commitment to delivering for our customers. GE Aerospace delivered a standout year financially with revenue up double digits, profit up $1.7 billion, and free cash flow up $1.3 billion. And we finished strong, surpassing our most recent guide. In the fourth quarter, robust demand continued. Orders were up 46%, and revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in services and equipment for both orders and revenue. Profit was up nearly 50%, and EPS more than doubled. Free cash flow was up over 20%, with conversion above 100%. At Commercial Engines & Services, our fourth quarter orders were up 50%, revenue was up 19%, and profit increased 44% while deliveries progressed.\n\nAnd for the full year, demand remained robust, with services orders up 30%, total revenue up double digits, and profit up 25% to $7.1 billion. In Defense & Propulsion Technologies, fourth quarter orders were up 22%, and defense units nearly doubled sequentially. For the full year, revenue was up 6% and profit increased 17% to $1.1 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, we\u2019re maintaining this momentum as we aim to deliver another year of substantial revenue, EPS, and cash growth. We expect departures growth of mid-single digits and increased military spending. This supports solid low double-digit revenue growth, including growth in CES and DPT. We expect profit in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion. This, combined with a lower share count, will translate to EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.45, up 15% at the midpoint.\n\nFor free cash flow, we expect to generate $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, with conversion remaining robust above 100%. And given the strength of our balance sheet, we\u2019re increasing our share repurchases to $7 billion and planning to raise our dividend by 30%, subject, of course, to Board approval. Overall, GE Aerospace is, I believe, an exceptional franchise with a tremendous financial profile. Stepping back, between 2023 and 2025, taking the midpoint of our guide, we expect to grow profit $2.5 billion and free cash flow nearly $2 billion over this two-year period. Today, we\u2019re focused on keeping our customers\u2019 fleets flying and delivering on our new engine backlog. Our team is using FLIGHT DECK to tackle supply chain constraints head on. From the first half to the second half of 2024, we delivered meaningful improvement as material inputs increased 26% across our priority supplier sites.\n\nThis, in turn, supported CES services revenue growth of 17% and engine unit growth of 18%, with defense and commercial both up double digits, including LEAP up 12%. We\u2019re encouraged by our progress more recently in the fourth quarter, where CES services revenue increased 12% year over year, supported by expanded shop visit workscope and spare parts growth. But this was lighter than we expected due to lower internal shop visit volume, given material constraints. Total engine units improved up 3%, with defense up 20%. But commercial was roughly flat, with LEAP down 5%. We\u2019ll need to drive further sustainable improvements to meet \u201925\u2019s demand, and this is exactly where FLIGHT DECK is so important. Earlier last year, our priority suppliers shipped only half of their committed targets to us.\n\nToday, they\u2019re shipping over 90% of the committed volume. At a recent joint Kaizen with a priority supplier, we focused on eliminating waste, achieving a 50% increase in output, 50%. And throughout 2024, we deployed over 550 of our supply chain and engineering resources into that same supply base, demonstrating that we\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re operating as one team. Building off this momentum, we\u2019re bringing together our engineering and supply chain teams into one new organization, Technology & Operations, which will be led by Mohamed Ali. With shared accountability across the full value chain, this cross-functional team will enable faster problem solving to help improve deliveries. These actions, combined with our close alignment on demand schedules, will enable higher material inputs in 2025 and, importantly, beyond.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ve expanded LEAP aftermarket capacity by approximately 40% in 2024. This will support the growing fleet of 3,300 LEAP-powered aircraft with now 10,000 engines in backlog. Here\u2019s how. First, we\u2019re eliminating waste and reducing turnaround time using FLIGHT DECK. For example, our on-wing support team redesigned the LEAP engine flow, increasing output by 50% for the year. This contributed to LEAP internal shop visit growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter alone. Second, we\u2019re investing more than $1 billion in our internal MRO facilities over the next five years. We\u2019re growing our repair technologies, which will help lower the cost of ownership and provide faster turnaround times. Our recently opened Services Technology Acceleration Center here in Ohio will be a key enabler in deploying repairs across our global MRO network.\n\nAnd third, we\u2019re strengthening our LEAP third-party network. Last year, five premier MROs completed around 10% of total LEAP shop visits. This is critical experience for them as their volume increases further in 2025. Overall, we\u2019re entering 2025 with a stronger foundation to service and deliver our engines faster with the highest possible levels of safety and quality. Turning to Slide 7, demand for our services and products remains robust, highlighted by orders up 46% in the fourth quarter. At CES and narrow-bodies, El Al Israeli Airlines confirmed its commitment for 20 737 MAXs with LEAP-1B engines underwing. We\u2019ve also extended service contracts, including a 10-year engine maintenance agreement with flydubai for their CFM56-powered aircraft.\n\nAnd notably, the Airbus 321XLR, powered by our LEAP-1A engines, completed its inaugural commercial long-haul flight. Our engines are providing airlines with greater route flexibility and overall operational efficiency. In wide-bodies, Royal Jordanian announced an order for 18 GEnx-1Bs, plus spares to power their expanded Boeing 787-9 fleet. And China Airlines also announced an agreement for 10 Boeing 777-9s with the GE9X under wing. In DPT, we\u2019re building on our leading defense programs. We received orders under a contract with the U.S. Army valued up to $1.1 billion for the continued production of T700 engines through 2029. The new T700s will power the Sikorsky H-60, the Bell H-1, and the Boeing AH-64 platforms. In addition to expanding our extensive install base, we\u2019re enhancing our customer solutions.\n\nWe signed an agreement to acquire Northstar Aerospace, a leading manufacturer of mission-critical gears and shafts. Northstar will be highly complementary to our Avio Aero business, providing a U.S.-based presence in this market and adding new programs and capabilities to deliver complex flight-critical parts. Stepping back, I couldn\u2019t be prouder about what we\u2019re building as GE Aerospace as we advance flight for today, tomorrow, and the future. Rahul, over to you.\n\nRahul Ghai: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. We closed out 2024 with another strong quarter. Orders were up 46%, with significant demand for both services and equipment. Revenue was up 16%, with growth in CES and DPT. Profit was $2 billion, up 49%, driven by services volume, favorable mix, and price. Margins were up 450 basis points to 20.1%. EPS of $1.32 more than doubled from profit growth and a reduced tax rate. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 21% from higher earnings. Working capital was a source, primarily from long-term service contract billings. While accounts receivables increased, day sales outstanding were down five days year over year. Given the ongoing material availability challenges, inventory increased, although at a lower rate than prior quarters.\n\nFor the year, orders were up 32%, including services orders up 30%. Revenue was up 10%, with growth in both segments. Profit increased 30% to $7.3 billion, with margins expanding 330 basis points to 20.7%, driven by commercial services. EPS increased 56% to $4.60 from significant profit growth, a lower tax rate, and the absence of preferred dividend. Free cash flow was up almost 30% to $6.1 billion, with conversion over 120%. Taken together, we delivered significant growth across all key metrics, both in the quarter and the year. Looking closer at our businesses, starting with CES. In the quarter, orders were up 50%, as services demand remained robust while equipment accelerated. Our recent wins build on our backlog of $154 billion, with about 90% of that backlog in services.\n\nRevenue was up 19%, with services up 12%, driven by shop visit revenue, higher spare parts, and price. Internal shop visit revenue, representing around 60% of services revenue, grew double digits. Increased work scopes, higher pricing, and engine mix more than offset shop visit volume that was down 3% due to material constraints. Spare parts revenue, representing roughly the other 40%, was up from higher volume and price. Equipment grew 38%. While we made progress, supply chain constraints impacted total deliveries, down 2%, including LEAP, down 5%. For the year, LEAP deliveries were down 10%, in line with our latest expectations. Lower volume was more than offset by customer mix and price. In addition, given our growing fleets with high utilization, we caught up on spare engine deliveries to support airline fleet stability.\n\nAlthough the spare engine ratio was elevated in the fourth quarter, overall LEAP life of program ratio through 2024 remains in low double digits. Profit was $2.2 billion, up 44%, as spare parts volume, increased shop visit workscope, mix, and price, more than offset inflation and investments. Margins expanded 490 basis points to 28.2%. Overall, CES delivered strong full-year results, with orders up 38%, revenue up 13%, and profit growing 25% to $7.1 billion. Margins expanded 250 basis points to 26.2%. Moving to DPT, orders were up 22%, primarily driven by Defense & Systems. Demand remains strong here as well, with defense book-to-bill of 1.2x for the quarter and the full year. Our backlog for the segment is now at $18 billion, up more than $1.5 billion year over year.\n\nRevenue grew 4%. Defense & Systems revenue was up 6%, driven by higher engine deliveries and price, partially offset by lower services. Defense units were up 20% year over year, with more than 90% quarter over quarter. Propulsion & Additive Technologies, or PAT, grew 2%, as lower commercial volume at Avio was more than offset by growth in other PAT businesses. Profit was up 2%, driven by improved pricing and productivity, partially offset by investments in next-gen engines and inflation. Margins were down 20 basis points. Overall, a strong finish, as full-year orders were up 10%, revenue grew 6%, and profit was up 17% to $1.1 billion, with margin expansion of 110 basis points. A moment on Corporate. We made substantial progress to ensure our operations reflect the needs of GE Aerospace as a standalone company.\n\nCorporate cost, including eliminations, was about $860 million for the year. Eliminations increased by $100 million to approximately $470 million from higher internal volume in PAT. Excluding eliminations, cost was down over a third to roughly $400 million, driven by lower functional expenses and higher interest income. We also fully exited our remaining stake in GE Healthcare this quarter. And for the year, we returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, including $5 billion of share buyback and a dividend of around 30% of net income. Based on the strength of our performance and balance sheet, GE Aerospace is well positioned to compound shareholder returns for the long term. Switching to our 2025 guide. Starting with CES, we expect mid-teens revenue growth for the segment.\n\nWe are now expecting services to be up low-double digits to mid-teens, up from our prior view of low-double digits. At the midpoint, we expect internal shop visit revenue to be up from higher workscope, improved pricing, and high single-digit shop visit volume growth, which is pushed to the right from 2024. We continue to expect low double-digit spare parts revenue growth from mid-single-digit air traffic growth and pricing. We expect equipment up high teens from growth in engine volume, including LEAP deliveries up 15% to 20% and pricing, more than offsetting negative engine mix. We expect $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion of profit at CES, reflecting the benefit of services growth. This will be partially offset by the impact from increased R&D investments and higher GE9X deliveries in the second half of the year.\n\nWe also expect a lower spare engine ratio. In DPT, we expect mid- to high-single digits revenue growth with increased defense units and profit in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Higher defense deliveries are partially offset by self-funded investments in the first half. Corporate costs are expected to be less than $1 billion. Eliminations are expected to grow as internal PAT volume grows. In total, we expect another year of low double-digit revenue growth for the Company, with profit in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.2 billion, up about $750 million or 10% at the midpoint over 2024. Turning to Slide 12, we expect EPS to be in the range of $5.10 to $5.45, up roughly 15% at the midpoint. About 80% of the improvement will be from higher profit.\n\nThe balance will come through a reduction in the tax rate, which is expected to improve to below 20%, and the benefit from share repurchases, including the $5 billion executed in 2024 and an additional $7 billion expected in 2025. We expect to generate $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion of free cash flow, with year-over-year growth primarily from higher earnings. Contributions from working capital and AD&A combined year over year will be more than offset by higher CapEx and cash tax payments. Overall, we expect another year of conversion that is solidly above 100%. Taken together, GE Aerospace is poised for another year of growth ahead. With that, Larry, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\n\nLarry Culp: Perfect. Thank you. 2024 clearly was a strong first year for us as GE Aerospace. We grew revenue, earnings, and cash significantly, along with returning over $6 billion to shareholders. That performance was underpinned by our competitive advantages. Our platforms are preferred by customers across the narrow-body, wide-body, and defense sectors. Our industry-leading services and technologies provide the highest levels of operational reliability, including greater efficiency, time on wing, and faster turnaround times. At the core of everything we do is safety, quality delivery \u2014 in that order. And we\u2019re focused on unrivaled customer service and flight support across the industry\u2019s most extensive install base with 70,000 engines.\n\nOur breakthrough innovations in both commercial and defense paved the way for more sustainable flight. And FLIGHT DECK, which connects our strategy to our results, enables us to deliver and create exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. We believe our path forward is clear. We\u2019re well positioned to deliver another year of substantial growth and deploy over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Before we wrap our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to take a moment to express our support for all of those impacted by the fires in Southern California. Seeing our CF6, CFM56, and T700 engines powering many of the planes battling the fires, we feel a deep connection to our commitment to safety and hope that those fires can be contained soon.\n\nBlaire, shall we go to Q&A?\n\nBlaire Shoor: Before we open the line, I\u2019d ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Liz, can you please open the line?\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) Follow General Electric Co (NYSE:GE) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\n\nScott Deuschle: Rahul, can you refresh us on what the 2025 guide is assuming with respect to LEAP OE profitability? And then, when LEAP OE achieves breakeven, do you foresee the profit trajectory flatlining from there? Or is it reasonable to think that LEAP OE could be a profit center in its own right as time goes on and you benefit from some of these recent pricing gains and operational efficiency initiatives?\n\nRahul Ghai: Yes. Absolutely, Scott. So let me start and Larry can add. Obviously, it\u2019s been a really good year for LEAP overall. I can start with answering your question, and Larry can comment on the operational improvements that we\u2019ve driven here in LEAP. So first, Scott, it was a milestone year for LEAP. LEAP services became profitable in 2024, and the program becomes breakeven in 2025, with OE following a year later in 2026. So that was our prior expectation that continues to be our expectation today. And as we look at LEAP, how it performed during the year, the profitability for the program tended to be better than our initial expectations, from higher external spare parts volume, better pricing, lower warranty expenses as some of those fixtures are going in, and more shop visits than we had initially expected.\n\nSo that\u2019s our expectation. And the key milestone for 2025 is that our profitability and margins for the program are getting better from increasing shop visits and higher external spare parts volume. And the OE performance improves despite more engines that we\u2019re going to ship. And just to comment on the external services volume, in 2024, shop visits \u2014 external shop visits were just north of 10%, and we expect that to increase to 15% in 2025. And on a sold basis, the shop visits that we have sold, about 25% of the shop visits are non-GE/Safran shop visits, and that will help future profitability. So overall, the program is on the right trajectory. And as the program kind of breaks even this year, OE becomes profitable next year, I think the services growth trajectory that the program has with the installed base is just going to power the program.\n\nSo, we expected LEAP to be kind of in CFM56 levels by 2028. Maybe CFM is performing a little bit better. But that\u2019s the trajectory that the program is on that, sometime in \u2014 late towards the end part of this decade, LEAP and CFM are delivering the same amount of profit for the Company. Larry, anything you want to add here?\n\nLarry Culp: I think you\u2019ve covered the landscape there. Clearly, much of what we\u2019ve talked about, Scott, just already this morning with respect to managing the supply base sets us up, particularly as we think about the ramps with LEAP. We would expect LEAP new units to be up 15% to 20% this year, more to come after that. So, that installed base growth, that aftermarket opportunity that Rahul was really talking about, is really a function of what we\u2019re doing currently with the installed base \u2014 the supply base. That, of course, coupled with the progress that we made with the HPT at the end of the year on the LEAP-1A sets us up, I think, even more strongly in the marketplace. And we know the engine\u2019s performing well in the market. I think we increased our share of cycles 300 basis points in 2024. So, we have a lot of good things in front of us. It\u2019s still, in many respects, early days for LEAP.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton: Congrats, Blaire, well deserved. At the start of \u201924, you were looking for about $1 billion of operating profit growth in \u201925 versus 2024. The new guidance, Rahul, as you mentioned, is $750 million of growth. I\u2019m not oblivious to the fact that you blew away the 2024 base number. But curious, just as you look at that sequential climb to \u201925, what in the base profit of \u201924 didn\u2019t translate into \u201925?\n\nRahul Ghai: So, Myles, if you step back and you look at the numbers that you alluded to, we were sitting in March of 2024 expecting to get to about $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion of profit by the end of 2025. And that was up quite a bit \u2014 $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion from where we ended 2023. Now, as we sit here today, as Larry said in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to add about $2.5 billion of profit in the two-year period. So that\u2019s about a third better than what we thought just nine months ago. So, the business is performing extremely well. Now, as you think about the 2025 profit, call it $800 million year over year at midpoint of $750 million and $1 billion dollars at the high end, so first, we spoke about the corporate eliminations up about $100 million from higher PAT volume.\n\nSo that\u2019s one thing, but put that aside. We expect CES profit to be up about $700 million at the midpoint. And the biggest driver of profit growth within CES is the drop through that we\u2019re getting from the services revenue that we expect to be up about $3 billion up year over year at the midpoint of the guide. And we expect services margins to be flat, despite with LEAP getting to be a greater share of that services revenue as other things \u2014 productivity, pricing \u2014 all that is offsetting the LEAP mix impact. And to offset the services within CES will be the impact from OE, about split 50-50 between the R&D step-up and the increase in GE9X shipments. We expect GE9X to be about a couple of hundred million dollars headwind in 2025 as we ramp the number of engines that we\u2019re shipping.\n\nAnd the spare engine ratio is expected to come down gradually as well here in \u201925. So that\u2019s the CES landscape. And in DPT, given the growth in backlog, $1.5 billion, so call it close to about 10% backlog growth in 2024, we expect mid to high single-digit revenue growth. That\u2019s going to translate into profit and with margins expanding about 70 basis points at the midpoint of the guide. So overall, should be a good year. And to get to the high end of $1 billion that you referenced, I think we just need services to be a little bit better and perform at the high end of the guidance.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\n\nRon Epstein: Good morning. Question for you on the GE9X. When we think about that, I mean, 777X is back in-flight test. Are there other opportunities for that engine beyond the 777X?\n\nLarry Culp: Ron, I would say that, at this point in time, we\u2019re fully focused on helping our friends in Seattle get this plane launched. So, we\u2019re obviously proud to be under wing. We think it\u2019s going to be a great wide-body program over time. Delighted to see, as you mentioned, flight testing resume. We\u2019ve started to ship engines to Boeing. So, we\u2019ve got work to do clearly, but the customer feedback relative to that aircraft and that engine continues to be quite strong. We\u2019ve got nearly, what, 1,000 engines now in backlog. And I\u2019d like to think that with the delays, we\u2019ve made good use of that time with respect to just additional testing, probably going to end up being the most tested engine in our history. We\u2019re approaching 2,500 cycles.\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve got a second dust test engine, critical and harsh and hot environments underway. And we\u2019re already on our second iteration of HPT blades, let alone the CMC nozzle designs. So, we\u2019re focused on that at the moment, but excited about that backlog and, ultimately, EIS.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Congrats, Blaire. I wanted to focus back on CES margins in Q4, just given the performance was so stellar at 28%. And even on slower expected services growth, given the internal shop visit volume hasn\u2019t quite turned the corner. So, when we think about the 2025 outlook, and Rahul, I know you talked about this a little bit, services, you raised the guidance here from just one month ago to low to mid-teens. Can you talk about the moving pieces as you think about just the mix of spares, parts versus internal, and how the different engines are contributing to that? And maybe if you could just talk about the cadence throughout the year as well.\n\nRahul Ghai: All right. So, Sheila, let me start, and obviously, if I don\u2019t hit anything, come back and make sure we answer the question. CES had a good quarter, better than what we had expected. Favorable services mix, Sheila, as you mentioned, the shop visit volume wasn\u2019t exactly where we needed to be, but spare parts did better. And again, as we\u2019re trying to manage the supply chain challenges that we\u2019re encountering, those parts are fungible and we kind of move them around every quarter to make sure that we are supporting our airline customers. So, there\u2019s always a little bit of tension between external spare parts volume and internal shop visits. So, the mix skewed towards the spare parts in the quarter. And then engine mix was favorable as well.\n\nAs we said in our prepared remarks, we caught up on the spare engines that we had not delivered in the first three quarters. So, we caught up here in the fourth quarter, but overall, as we expect, spare engine ratio for LEAP is in low double digits. So, it\u2019ll gradually come down, but we\u2019re not expecting a steep drop-off here. So, as you think about \u201925, Sheila, within CES, we do expect spare parts to remain strong here, given where the external market is. We expect the departures to be up kind of mid-single digits, and then all the pricing changes that we implemented last year, that they\u2019ll be thinking about the summer, get spare parts to be kind of up low double digits. And the shop visit revenue, we\u2019re expecting shop visit revenue to be up mid-teens.\n\nAnd that\u2019s going to come from high single-digit shop visit volume growth. And you combine that with the work scopes that are increasing, be it the wide-body programs like GE90 going for the second shop visit, and GEnx\u2019s coming for the first shop visits versus a quick turn earlier, and then LEAP. So, work scopes are increasing, and then modest price increases baked into that service portfolio. So that\u2019s kind of the landscape of the CES revenue growth. And then that is going to drive the profit in response to Myles\u2019 question earlier. Now, we\u2019re going to come out of the gate strong here, Sheila, within CES especially. And the primary driver for that is the 9X shipments are more towards the back end of the year. But we are entering the year for spare parts with about 90% of that revenue in our backlog.\n\nSo, we\u2019ll have a strong quarter here to start with in our spare part sales. We expect shop visits to grow as well. And then we had the CMR of over $200 million in 1Q of last year; we\u2019re not expecting that to repeat. So, we\u2019ll start the year strongly on profit. And revenue for the quarter for CES should be kind of in line with what we\u2019re expecting for full year. Hopefully that answers the question, Sheila.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.\n\nDoug Harned: I want to just follow up a little more on the commercial services growth. Because when you talk about low double-digit to mid-teens next year, that\u2019s a little better than you were talking about before or this year. But can you talk about where that\u2019s coming from? Because wide-body versus narrow-body, in other words, could you go higher if you can resolve these supply chain issues?\n\nLarry Culp: Doug, as you would imagine, it\u2019s a broad-based demand strengthening that we see. Could we go higher? We\u2019ve got work to do with the supply chain to execute on what Rahul just walked everybody through. But there is more pent-up demand there. We\u2019ve got the backlog. An unhelpful level of that is, in many respects, delinquent. So, if we could continue to deliver the sequential improvements in inputs, combined with the progress I know we\u2019re making in our own shops, I wouldn\u2019t say no. But we\u2019ve got work to do to deliver what we just outlined. But again, it won\u2019t be a demand challenge for us in 2025, we believe. We don\u2019t want to take it all for granted. But given the environment, given the backlog, it really is about operational execution. That\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard: Just a question on the LEAP. You\u2019re expecting 15% to 20% growth this year, and Rahul said that you expect the spares ratio in that to come down. So, looking at the remnant of those engines, how are you expecting the split to go between Airbus and Boeing in 2025?\n\nLarry Culp: Well, we don\u2019t get into that level of detail publicly. But I think we are, as you would imagine, in frequent contact with all of our customers, particularly those two vis-\u00e0-vis the intentions they have for 2025. I think we are well aligned to support both of them as they step up production this year.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman: I wanted to ask about the \u2014 in terms of spares growth, you kind of talked about departures and price. One of the other things I\u2019m kind of curious about is provisioning of third-party shops to do more LEAP maintenance over time, the degree to which that\u2019s happened, the degree to which that\u2019s still in front of us and affects kind of the spares growth trajectory, and maybe also the CapEx that you\u2019re doing and how you think, over time, that plays into the amount of LEAP work that will be done internally versus externally?\n\nRahul Ghai: So, Seth, let me start and Larry can jump in here. Obviously, as we\u2019re coming out of the gate here, most of the shop visits have been internal. As we said, about 90%, give or take, were shop visits that we performed within Safran and GE. The external network is beginning to step up. We have five external partners. They\u2019re beginning to get volume. We spoke about the Akasa win with one of the third-party MRO partners that we have last quarter. So, those visits are stepping up, and they\u2019ve been stepping up sequentially as the year has gone on. So, as we think about 2025, we expect about, call it, 15%-ish of our shop visits to be external. And then, as I said earlier, about 25% of the shop visits that we have sold are going to be performed by our third-party MRO partners.\n\nAnd then, that will gradually grow up as we get into 2030 and beyond. So that\u2019s the trajectory we are on. And within that, obviously, spare parts will grow. Spare parts sales will grow as more shop visits are performed externally. So, the margins on the program will get better because of that dynamic. But overall, even on the services side, on our internal service contract, just given all the durability improvements that Larry just mentioned, our margins on our internal work that we are performing are very stable. I mean, we\u2019ve had a couple of good years of service profitability results here on our own service contract. So, we feel good about that as well.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss: I just wanted to touch on the free cash flow forecast for 2025, Rahul. Maybe if you could go into \u2014 it looks like you\u2019re assuming neutral-ish overall working capital, maybe a slight tailwind. How are you thinking that kind of breaks out between inventory, LTSA cash, AD&A, just those moving pieces within working capital?\n\nRahul Ghai: Yes. So David, most of the cash growth in \u201925 is going to be driven by our earnings. Working capital and AD&A combined should be a positive contributor. And within working capital, the inventory buildup should be less than what we had in 2024. I mean, in inventory, we added about $1.5 billion of inventory in 2024. We\u2019re obviously not expecting to add the same level. Now, again, our primary objective is to increase our deliveries, and we will do what it takes. But with the improvement in deliveries, we do expect that some of the inventory that we\u2019ve built up will start getting liquidated. The flip side of that is the contract assets, which was a very favorable contributor in \u201924, will not be as favorable in \u201925, just given the increase in shop visits.\n\nSo still a positive, but not as much of a positive. So that\u2019s kind of within the working capital. Now, AD&A, overall, we ended at about $300 million of outflow in \u201924, which was consistent with what we thought at the beginning of the year, a little bit more skewed towards the fourth quarter, but expect overall AD&A outflow to be at the same level, maybe marginally higher. So that\u2019s kind of the expectation on AD&A. And then, the positive contributions from working capital and AD&A will be offset by the expected higher cash tax payments next year and a step-up in CapEx. So, conversion, still solidly above 100%, maybe a little bit lower than what we had in 2024.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.\n\nJason Gursky: And Blaire, congratulations on the elevated role, well deserved. Rahul and Larry, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes on labor productivity across the Company and where you think you are relative to pre-pandemic levels. And what you think it\u2019s going to take for the Company to get back to the productivity that we\u2019re seeing prior to the pandemic? And just how much of that is actually in your control and how much of it is dependent on external suppliers getting you what you need on time?\n\nLarry Culp: Jason, I think that as I look back on 2024, everything that we saw come through the financials, everything we saw visiting a number of our operations, just ample evidence that the FLIGHT DECK principles and tools really are helping us go in, put the operators at the center of all put the operators at the center of all we do and just drain the waste out of their daily work. That, to me, is the heart of labor productivity. Unfortunately, that work that we see with our own eyes hasn\u2019t fully translated into either better on-time delivery performance or labor productivity for the very reason that you touched on. And I don\u2019t want this to sound in any way defensive, the progress that we\u2019re making with those material inputs that we referenced in the prepared remarks, the sequential first half, second half, up 26%, coupled with the higher predictability, the higher reliability of those inputs, north of 90% now for the critical suppliers, will enable us to have more predictable, more linear flow through our factories, through our repair shops, such that I think we\u2019ll actually do better from a labor productivity.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to quantify how much, if you will, labor lack of productivity comes as a result of our delivery challenges on the inbound side. But as we work those, I think we sit here fully expecting to be able to deliver better labor productivity in \u201925 and certainly from there.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS.\n\nGavin Parsons: I\u2019d love to just kind of go further into supply chain a little bit. It sounds like it\u2019s getting better. You\u2019ve got the LEAP-1A blade certified, but internal shop visits were still down in the fourth quarter. Just maybe if you could go into where the bottlenecks or the pain points still are and if that\u2019s a linear improvement through \u201925 or if that\u2019s a step function at some point on an unlock?\n\nLarry Culp: Well, I don\u2019t think we have much by way of new news in that regard. The challenge remains as it has with 15 or so critical suppliers that we\u2019re working intensely with. I think we mentioned yet again today that we\u2019ve got well over 500 of our own people embedded in the supply base working to identify and eliminate constraints, thus unlocking the output that we need. I think as we look at \u201924, the progress that we made in hindsight is significant, but it came in fits and starts. It was a game of inches, if you will. I think that will continue to be the case in 2025. There\u2019s no step function improvement necessarily sitting out there on the HPT blade. Certainly, the LEAP-1A durability kit will help. But more broadly speaking, it really is working through the entirety of the supply base to make sure they\u2019re clear on our demand signals that those are being properly deployed and that we\u2019re working through whatever capacity constraints, bottlenecks, and the like that they may have in their own operations.\n\nAnd that, to me, is really what\u2019s so critical. And that\u2019ll be fundamental to how we support Boeing this year as they ramp, particularly on the 737 MAX. The same goes with Airbus. We know we\u2019re working very hard, well aligned with Airbus as we both march toward their rate 75. So, a lot to do. It won\u2019t be linear, but I think we have tremendous confidence that we\u2019re coming into 2025 far better prepared for the ramp than we were coming into 2024. And the final thing I\u2019ll say is that we often talk about the ramp wholly focused on new make. The work we do with our supply base helps us support the air framers, but it\u2019s often the same parts and the same suppliers that feed into the aftermarket. I would just caution anyone about over-indexing on that, say that 15% to 20% increase in LEAP new make in 2025, the demands on the supply base are going to be in excess of that, again, because we also need to support the aftermarket with those same partners.\n\nRahul Ghai: And Gavin, just to add to what Larry just said, just as we think about 2025 here and as we\u2019re coming out of the gate, you saw the sequential improvement in our engine output in 4Q. We expect that continuously sequential improvement as we go through the year. But what that translates into a little bit more growth on a year-over-year basis as we get into the second and third quarters, because that\u2019s where we had some challenging quarters last year, because we started out well coming out of the gate in 1Q. So how that translates for our overall business, and just to add to what I said to Sheila\u2019s question earlier about how CES is going to perform, I think the same applies to DPT as well. DPT is going to have a little softer start here in 1Q, given the first quarter was pretty strong for DPT, but a little slower start in DPT, plus some of the internal investments that we are making in the business to support the new programs.\n\nSo, if you step back and look at the Company overall, we expect overall full-year revenue for the first quarter to line up with what we are expecting for full year for the Company. Our profit will be flat, maybe sequentially down a little bit versus what we did in the fourth quarter. As we go from 4Q to 1Q, profit could be flat to be slightly down, but strong growth on a year-over-year basis and margins should expand in the quarter as well.\n\nBlaire Shoor: Liz, we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator: This question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\n\nRobert Spingarn: Larry, maybe I can finish off with a high-level strategic question. Some would argue that RTX\u2019s ability to bundle Pratt\u2019s propulsion technology with Collins\u2019 offering in avionics and structures could provide them with a competitive advantage when bidding for work packages on future aircraft programs. Your balance sheet is in great shape. This is evidenced by your updated cash deployment plans this morning. And since you are going to generate a lot of cash over the next five years, is there any desire to expand the business beyond propulsion through organic or more particularly inorganic means?\n\nLarry Culp: I think we will stand by our capital allocation framework that we shared almost a year ago now with respect to how we think we will deploy not only our cash flows and our cash reserves in \u201925, but going forward. We certainly have ample resources. But again, just to reiterate, we are going to have a strong bias toward shareholder returns. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will exclude M&A, but as you saw with the Northstar announcement, much of what we will do will be small tuck-ins and adjacencies. I don\u2019t think I have ever, in this role at this company or elsewhere, publicly commented on specific situations, and I think I will hold to that again here this morning. But we appreciate and understand the question.\n\nBlaire Shoor: Larry, any final comments?\n\nLarry Culp: Blaire, I would just wrap up to say the team all around the world delivered standout results in 2024. And clearly, the finish there in the fourth quarter was no exception. I hope everybody on the call heard how excited we are about the year ahead as we work to meet what we believe to be historic industry demand and deliver for our customers. We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in GE Aerospace.\n\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

Threat for US-made F-16, tension for Pakistan because\u2026\n\nThe Tejas MK1A fighter jet, which aligns with India's \"Make in India\" initiative, aims to replace the IAF's aging fleet of MiG-21 s, and enhance its operational readiness.\n\n(File)\n\nIndia is developing its indigenously-built Tejas fleet of fighter jets to replace the aging fleet of Soviet-era MiG fighters in the Indian Air Force. Currently, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) of New Delhi\u2019s Ministry of Defense\u2019s Department of Defence Research and Development is developing Tejas MK1A fighter jet, the latest variant of the light combat aircraft.\n\nHowever, India\u2019s ambitious fighter jet program is facing a major obstacle in development, US manufacturer General Electric (GE) has delayed the delivery of the F404 engine, which will be used to power the Tejas MK1A aircraft. The engine was scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2023, after a deal was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s US visit that year.\n\nBut the delivery has faced prolonged delays, and now is set to April 2025, halting the IAF\u2019s induction schedule, and adversely affecting its operational preparedness, leading Defence Ministry to impose on the US manufacturer.\n\nChallenge for US F-16, threat to Pakistan\n\nWhile GE has blamed supply chain issues from its Korean partner for the prolonged delay, several experts claim that the obstruction could be a deliberate attempt to sabotage India\u2019s fighter jet program as Tejas MK1A variants presents a credible challenge to US-made fighter jets like the F-16 in the global market.\n\nThe Tejas combat aircraft has showcased its impressive capabilities at various international air shows, resulting in several nations expressing interest in purchasing India\u2019s 4.5 generation fighter jet to replace their aging warplanes. This presents a direct challenge to the US fighter jets, making the delay in delivery of engines for the Tejas program suspicious, to say the least.\n\nNotably, US recently bagged a contract for delivery a fleet of F-16s to Argentina, but the Tejas is also giving tough competition to another similar combat plane, the JF-17 Thunder, jointly built by Pakistan and China. Tejas has several advantages over the JF-17 Thunder, and is closer in capabilities to the F-16, while being comparatively cheaper than both.\n\nIndia\u2019s Tejas fighter jet program is also a major threat to Pakistan, as JF-17 Thunder is the most advanced warplane in the Pakistan Air Force, but the Chinese-Pakistani combat plane lacks some of the capabilities of the new Tejas MK1A variant.\n\nTejas MK1A fighter jet\n\nDeveloped by ADA, and manufactured by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Tejas MK1A is a 4.5 generation, single-engine, multirole light fighter aircraft featuring updated avionics, active electronically scanned array radar, updated electronic warfare suite, and increased indigenous content.\n\nThe Tejas MK1A, which aligns with India\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative, aims to replace the IAF\u2019s aging fleet of MiG-21 s, and enhance its operational readiness. The first flight of the Tejas Mk1A prototype took place in May 2022, and first production series Mark 1A aircraft (LA 5033) made its first flight in March 2024,\n\nBesides the delays in obtaining new engines, the Tejas Mk1A is also battling a Danish export ban on the aircraft\u2019s engine charge amplifier, apart from delays in the delivery of software from Israel, and required certifications.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

            "content": "GE is a multi-national conglomerate that was originally incorporated in 1892. The company was founded by Thomas Edison as the Edison General Electric Company and shortened its name to General Electric following a merger with two other early electric pioneers. The name was later shortened again to GE. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts but has operations on a global scale. One of the original 12 Dow stocks, the company was a component of the index for 122 years until its ousting in 2018.\n\nOriginally intended to make and market Edison\u2019s incandescent lamp and following products, the company grew over the years through mergers, acquisitions, and natural expansion into newly created fields. Among the many early accomplishments is the creation of RCA and NBC which will both become forces of their own. Other major innovations include the world\u2019s first turbine superchargers, industrial gas turbine engines, and the first jet engine. In the field of computing, General Electric Company is credited as being one of the 8 major computer companies of the 1960s and shares responsibility for today\u2019s digital world. In regard to its employees, two were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work with the company.\n\nToday GE operates as a high-tech industrial company in Europe, China, Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates through four segments including Power, Renewables, Aerospace, and Healthcare although there are plans in the works to split the company into three separate entities. The three new companies would be GE Vernova (power and renewables), GE Health, and GE Aerospace. The spin-offs are expected to be completed by 2025.\n\nThe Power segment offers a variety of turbine engines for power production as well as the full range of services from plant construction to retrofit and refit. The Renewables segment is focused on solutions for renewable energy including wind and hydro and the technology to operate them. The Aviation segment manufactures aircraft engines of all varieties and the Healthcare segment offers technology for imaging, monitoring, diagnostics, and drug discovery to health and medical facilities.\n\nGeneral Electric is committed to helping the world transition to a greener way of life and is exiting the new-build coal-fired power industry. Instead, its advancements in wind, grid efficiency, and natural gas are being deployed around the world helping to reduce emissions and generate cleaner energy for businesses, industry, and communities. The company is targeting 2030 for its own carbon neutrality and 2050 for net zero emissions.",

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nENIAC, the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, built during World War II by the United States. American physicist John Mauchly, American engineer J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and their colleagues at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania led a government-funded project to build an all-electronic computer. Under contract to the army and under the direction of Herman Goldstine, work began in early 1943 on ENIAC. The next year, mathematician John von Neumann began frequent consultations with the group.\n\nENIAC was something less than the dream of a universal computer. Designed specifically for computing values for artillery range tables, it lacked some features that would have made it a more generally useful machine. It used plugboards for communicating instructions to the machine; this had the advantage that, once the instructions were thus \u201cprogrammed,\u201d the machine ran at electronic speed. Instructions read from a card reader or other slow mechanical device would not have been able to keep up with the all-electronic ENIAC. The disadvantage was that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This was such a liability that only with some generosity could it be called programmable.\n\nNevertheless, ENIAC was the most powerful calculating device built to date. It was the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer. Like Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine (from the 19th century) and the British World War II computer Colossus, it had conditional branching\u2014that is, it could execute different instructions or alter the order of execution of instructions based on the value of some data. (For instance, IF X>5 THEN GO TO LINE 23.) This gave ENIAC a lot of flexibility and meant that, while it was built for a specific purpose, it could be used for a wider range of problems.\n\nBritannica Quiz Computers and Operating Systems\n\nENIAC was enormous. It occupied the 50-by-30-foot (15-by-9-metre) basement of the Moore School, where its 40 panels were arranged, U-shaped, along three walls. Each panel was about 2 feet wide by 2 feet deep by 8 feet high (0.6 metre by 0.6 metre by 2.4 metres). With more than 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays, it was easily the most complex electronic system theretofore built. ENIAC ran continuously (in part to extend tube life), generating 174 kilowatts of heat and thus requiring its own air conditioning system. It could execute up to 5,000 additions per second, several orders of magnitude faster than its electromechanical predecessors. It and subsequent computers employing vacuum tubes are known as first-generation computers. (With 1,500 mechanical relays, ENIAC was still transitional to later, fully electronic computers.)\n\nCompleted by February 1946, ENIAC had cost the government $400,000, and the war it was designed to help win was over. Its first task was doing calculations for the construction of a hydrogen bomb. A portion of the machine is on exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nLast week, Car & General launched a brand new dealership in Kitui, Kenya. The dealer, Salaba Holdings, will be retailing the company\u2019s Piaggio three-wheelers and TVS motorcycles as well as offer service and parts in the eastern region town. Kitui is 162 km east of Kenya\u2019s capital city, Nairobi, and about 435 km from Mombasa.\n\nCar & General is one of the leading distributors of tuk-tuks and motorcycles in Kenya. Car & General was the pioneer of tuk-tuks and motorcycles as taxis in Kenya over two decades ago. The tuk-tuk and motorcycle sectors in Kenya are dominated by ICE vehicles. However, we are starting to see some significant traction towards electrification. Electric motorcycles had a 4% market share in new motorcycle registrations in 2023 and electric tuk-tuks managed to get close to 1% in 2023.\n\nIn a major boost for the electric three-wheeler sector last year, Car & General launched its electric three-wheelers in Nairobi and Mombasa in a bid to revolutionize transport by contributing to cleaner environment and lower operational costs. Car & General says e-mobility solutions cut down emissions, thus alleviating challenges of climate change, and therefore the company is keen on promoting the electric vehicle sector. After launching Piaggio electric 3-wheelers in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa, Car & General also partnered with CHAJI to deploy 30 charging stations in Mombasa to facilitate seamless charging of these electric three-wheelers in Kenya\u2019s largest coastal city.\n\nCar & General says CHAJI\u2019s smart socket charging solution is an ideal match for its electric 3-wheelers, which come equipped with quick charging capabilities through a provided off-board charger. This technology ensures that its electric three-wheelers can be rapidly and efficiently charged, minimizing downtime and significantly enhancing the appeal of electric vehicles for commercial use and passenger use.\n\nHere are the specs of the Piaggio electric tuk-tuks on sale in Kenya:\n\nAp\u00e9 E-City FX Max (Passenger Version)\n\n145 km (\u00b1 5 km) driving range on a single charge\n\nTop speed of 50 km/h\n\n8 kWh lithium-ion battery (51.2 V)\n\n4.4 kW peak motor @3,500 rpm\n\n29 Nm peak torque\n\n3 kW charger\n\nCharge time: 3 hours 45 mins\n\nBigger, 12\u201d tyre size\n\nGrade ability of 20%\n\nWarranty \u2014 1 year\n\nTransparent windows on the side\n\nTelematics 2.0 (improved location accuracy, new features on mobile app for drivers & owners)\n\nAp\u00e9 E-Xtra FX Max (Cargo Version)\n\n115 km (\u00b1 5 km) driving range on a single charge\n\nTop speed of 50 km/h\n\n8 kWh lithium-ion battery (51.2 V)\n\n5.5 kW peak motor @3,500 rpm\n\n45 Nm peak torque\n\n3 kW charger\n\nCharge time: 3 hours 45 mins\n\nBigger, 12\u201d tyre size\n\nHigher ground clearance of 220 mm\n\nGrade ability of 19%\n\nWarranty \u2014 1 year\n\nTelematics 2.0 (improved location accuracy, new features on mobile app for drivers & owners)\n\nThe new dealership in Kitui helps Car & General expand its reach. Car & General says it wants to take its products closer to customers. This move will also play a role in catalysing adoption of electric three-wheelers, as more people outside Nairobi and Mombasa will be able to get an opportunity to see these vehicles, test drive them, as well as purchase them.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the new dealership in Kitui, Jones Musau, the Regional Manager for C&G said, \u201cC&G is committed to its mantra of making customers smile in every street, in every town with quality products and after-sales services. Our two and three wheelers play an integral role in transforming millions of lives by creating employment opportunities and providing reliable and efficient last mile connectivity for people and goods. This launch of the Kitui dealer resonates with Car & General\u2019s philosophy of moving its products and services closer to its customers.\u201d\n\nIf you have ever been to Mombasa, Kenya, and other towns in the coastal regions, such as Malindi, Watamu, Kilifi, and Diani, you may have noticed that 3-wheelers are an integral part of the transport ecosystem in the coastal region. Currently, Mombasa on its own has close to 15,000 passenger 3-wheelers on the road with internal combustion engines, making it a key transport mode for the region.\n\n3-wheelers are also used in other parts of the country, and 99% of these 3-wheelers are still internal combustion engine based. Accelerating the transition to electric will go a long way in reducing emissions from these 3-wheelers, as well as reducing the noise pollution. The entry of large players such as Car & General into Kenya\u2019s electric three-wheeler sector as well as the rollout of charging infrastructure by players such as CHAJI will go a long way along the journey to catalyse adoption of electric vehicles in Kenya. It\u2019s really great to see Car & General is expanding its footprint and adding new locations such as Kitui.\n\nWe have been covering developments in the electric motorcycle and three-wheeler sector in Kenya for over 6 years now. During that time, most of the activities have been focusing on Nairobi, and more recently Mombasa as well. Outside of a few pilots, there haven\u2019t been a lot of activities in other cities and towns. This is why I am excited to see Car & General and partners open a dealership in Kitui. As the official distributors of Piaggio electric tuk-tuks in Kenya, it means more people outside the big cities can also get an opportunity to go electric.\n\nIn general, the motorcycle segment has gotten a lot of attention in a number of African countries as one of the lowest hanging fruits for electrification. There are over 27 million ICE motorbikes registered across Africa, with around 80% of them used in the motorcycle taxi industry. This presents a large addressable market for players in the sector. It\u2019s great to see electric tuk-tuks also coming into the mix.\n\nSpeaking of electric mobility companies in Kenya, in general, a lot of them had been going through various phases of piloting their products to get the right market fit as well as suitable and scalable business models. Quite a number of them are now starting to emerge from this phase and are in the initial phases of commercializing the latest iterations of their products and business models. This give us hope that 2025 will be the year when quite a number of them really start to gain significant traction in the market.",

However, Honda understands two things very well: to maintain its status as the world\u2019s largest engine manufacturer, it must include electric engines in its lineup, and it needs to distinguish itself from both domestic and Chinese competition.\n\nHonda's first significant electric debut was the Prologue, essentially its version based on General Motors' Ultium electric platform. On the sidelines, there\u2019s also the Honda e, a city electric car sold in Europe in limited quantities with a range of about 220 km, primarily aimed at avoiding hefty fines for exceeding the EU\u2019s emissions targets\u2014not exactly a market-conquering product. Honda's Afeela 1 (credit: Manufacturer's Website)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Honda showcased its highly anticipated collaboration with Sony, the Afeela 1, at the CES technology exhibition in Las Vegas. This large electric sedan measures 4.9 meters in length with a 300 cm wheelbase and sports a design reminiscent of the Lucid Air, targeting the premium market. Like Tesla\u2019s Model S in its early days, it\u2019s aimed squarely at the upper tier of the segment.\n\nThe car features dual electric motors and all-wheel drive, delivering a combined output of 490 horsepower. Its declared range, under the relatively strict EPA standard, stands at 483 km, powered by a 91 kWh battery. However, if Tesla\u2019s Model S is the benchmark, Honda falls short in range, power, and charging speed, which is limited to 150 kW at fast-charging stations. As befits a multimedia and communication systems provider, Sony ensures there are plenty of screens in the car (credit: Manufacturer's Website)\n\nIn the Honda-Sony partnership, Honda took charge of the vehicle and manufacturing, while Sony focused on software and multimedia systems, which are becoming increasingly central in today\u2019s automotive products. The safety systems include around 40 sensors, including LiDAR, and the cabin features an array of screens\u2014blind-spot displays, a digital dashboard, a large multimedia screen, augmented reality projections, and rear passenger screens. Naturally, the audio system is Sony-made, offering 360-degree surround sound and active noise cancellation.\n\nThe question of who will market the car in Israel\u2014Meir, Honda\u2019s official importer, or Isfar, Sony\u2019s importer\u2014remains unanswered, and neither company has clarified when or where the car will be available. For now, the car is only planned for sale in California (credit: Manufacturer's Website)\n\nStill, this is a discussion about a distant prospect. For now, the car is only planned for sale in California, with initial deliveries set for 2026. Prices will range from $90,000 to $103,000, placing it firmly in the upper tier of the U.S. electric car market. It\u2019s more expensive than the Mercedes EQE and base versions of Tesla\u2019s Model S, which sell in Israel for over NIS 600,000. However, considering Honda\u2019s recent pricing trends in Israel\u2014such as the HR-V\u2014it\u2019s not entirely surprising. The SUV 0, it seems like they started designing it but went home early when they got to the rear (credit: Manufacturer's Website)\n\nIf the Afeela 1 feels like a distant possibility, Honda\u2019s two concept cars, the Honda 0 Saloon and \"0 SUV,\" are even further off. At least in the case of the Sedan, it\u2019s the second appearance of a concept car that debuted last year. But as mentioned, Honda is taking its time. Production for these models is expected in 2026, with the crossover slated to arrive first.\n\nBoth models feature sharp lines, with the Sedan paying homage to Italian concept cars of the 1970s by Bertone, which inspired vehicles like the Lancia Stratos and Lamborghini Countach. The SUV, set to hit the market first, appears more \"finished\" in terms of exterior design, though its proportions, especially the compact rear, still need refining. Will autonomous driving be possible in the future? (credit: Manufacturer's Website)\n\nAccording to Honda, the guiding principles behind these models are \"thin, light, and smart,\" aiming to tackle one of the biggest challenges of electric cars: their weight, which significantly impacts range. Without providing concrete technical details, Honda focuses on its new operating system, \"Asimo OS,\" named after its humanoid robot introduced 20 years ago at CES. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nHonda states that the software will enable semi-autonomous driving in production versions. Initially, the cars will offer Level 3 autonomy on specific, adapted highways. Over-the-air (OTA) updates will allow Honda to upgrade the system as technology advances.\n\nThese three projects were underway long before the Honda-Nissan merger was announced. It will be interesting to see how they fit into the new partnership. Will we see Nissan and Infiniti versions of these models, or will the group prioritize promoting Nissan\u2019s Ariya electric SUV and its counterparts?",

            "content": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 While President Donald Trump took aim at the electric vehicle industry this week, there is still optimism about the industry\u2019s future in Michigan, a state retooling from America\u2019s most recognizable auto hub to its number one destination for electric vehicle investment.\n\nWATCH: Trump pushes for more oil and gas production and a rollback of climate initiatives\n\nMore than $27 billion is being poured into some 60 EV manufacturing and battery projects in the state, edging out even Georgia, with $26.6 billion, according to Atlas Public Policy, indicating that the birthplace of the modern auto industry continues to be central to its present and future.\n\nMichigan is home to hundreds of supply companies in addition to the automakers.\n\nThere is Factory ZERO, GM\u2019s remade assembly plant for electric Hummers and Silverados in the diverse Detroit neighborhood of Hamtramck, on a lot rich with auto history.\n\nThere is the $1.6 billion battery manufacturing campus in Van Buren Township in southeast Michigan that\u2019s expected to create more than 2,100 jobs and the equivalent of 200,000 EV battery packs each year once fully running.\n\nAnd there is the futuristic building in Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood, next to the once-blighted Michigan Central train station Ford renovated, now home to Newlab, where entrepreneurs experiment on high-tech equipment, network with other founders and funders and collaborate with automakers.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\n\u201cI think that the investments aren\u2019t ill spent,\u201d said auto dealer Eric Frehs\u00e9e, even with the president\u2019s changes in policy. He was referring both to state electrification efforts and preparing his business, Tamaroff Auto Group in Metro Detroit, for EVs.\n\nFrehs\u00e9e has bought forklifts to lift heavy batteries at the dealership and taught his technicians to work on EVs that come in for maintenance. He\u2019s installed chargers. Frehs\u00e9e sells Nissan, Honda, Acura and Kia vehicles, each of which now have EV models for sale.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s still the direction that we\u2019re heading,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the east side of Detroit, Ray Smith runs an EV training program for aspiring auto technicians. At Blast Detroit, would-be apprentices learn to diagnose EV electrical, software and battery systems and compare them to traditional gasoline-fueled cars.\n\nRegardless of federal policy changes, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move forward, of course,\u201d Smith said.\n\nMonday, the president signed an executive order promising to eliminate an EV \u201cmandate,\u201d referring to President Joe Biden\u2019s target for 50 percent of new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 to be electric and Environmental Protection Agency action to slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles over the coming years. The policies never required automakers to sell electric vehicles or consumers to buy them.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s order indicates he will roll back those pollution rules. Perhaps more important to some consumers, he is likely to seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases. He already paused billions of dollars in funding allocated for EV charging stations.\n\nREAD MORE: What\u2019s next for EVs as Trump aims to eliminate Biden-era incentives?\n\nStellantis, the manufacturer of Jeep and Ram, said in a statement it is \u201cwell positioned to adapt to the policy changes enacted by the new Administration\u201d and that it looks forward to working with the president. Ford had no comment on the changes, and a GM spokesperson did not comment.\n\nAlready, the EV industry broadly has faced headwinds. Some automakers have pulled back plans to go electric, and though EVs accounted for 8.1 percent of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024, the pace of the sales growth slowed from the year before, according to Motorintelligence.com. While EVs are getting more affordable, they still cost more up front than a car that runs on gasoline.\n\nAt the nonprofit Eastern Michigan Electric Automobile Association, president Bruce Westlake told The Associated Press that customers are coming in with the desire to clean up the environment. But that demand could dampen with less federal support for EVs and clean energy broadly.\n\nU.S. automakers \u201cmay find themselves in a position they can\u2019t recover from where they are making what the market doesn\u2019t want,\u201d Westlake added.\n\n\u201cThe Michigan EV industry is caught between building vehicles that are profitable now,\u201d he said, referring to gasoline cars, at the cost of having EVs ready for the future. \u201cI believe that initial investments will mostly be lost.\u201d\n\nAnother Detroit-based company, Plug Zen, focuses on EV charging for companies that have fleets of cars and trucks. Eventually it wants to put chargers at workplaces and multi-family housing where charging can be very hard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a wait and see approach when it comes to Michigan and how all those things are going to pan out,\u201d CEO Q Johnson told the AP. He regularly works with people in the Michigan EV industry, and said he doesn\u2019t expect them to dramatically change direction.\n\nWhy? \u201cWe\u2019re determined not to be left behind.\u201d",

During a conference call with analysts, Hyundai CFO Lee Seung Jo revealed that GM could sell Hyundai electric vans in the U.S. - models that would bear a logo from one of GM's brands. Basically, he said the company was considering simply renaming its electric utility vehicles and supplying them to GM, which would give the company a presence in the commercial van segment in North America.\n\nIt\u2019s not known yet whether this would give GM access to Hyundai's ST1 platform or to other types of Hyundai models. The Korean automaker also markets a hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck, a product that could, for example, serve the California market.\n\nThe ST1 electric van, in profile | Photo: Hyundai\n\nAccording to Reuters, Hyundai and GM are expected to finalize the details of their partnership by the end of March. The two parties are currently discussing a collaboration covering regular and commercial vehicles, as well as a parts supply, again according to the report.\n\nWhen the Memorandum of Understanding was signed last year, the two parties also discussed the possibility of jointly developing new products and sourcing raw materials for batteries, as well as steel.\n\nAnd as Hyundai's CEO pointed out, there are plenty of things to watch out for on the political front in 2025, both in South Korea and in the U.S. Turbulent politics have been making headlines every week for some time over there, while over here, the arrival in power of Donald Trump, and his announced retreat from any measures related to electrification (not to mention threats of tariffs) are creating a climate of uncertainty.",

General Electric\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 20.5% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand recently accelerated. General Electric\u2019s recent history shows it\u2019s one of the better General Industrial Machinery businesses as many of its peers faced declining sales because of cyclical headwinds.\n\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, General Electric\u2019s 2.8% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmarks, but there are still things to like about General Electric.\n\nAutomation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.\n\nOne of the original 12 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a multinational conglomerate providing technologies for various sectors including aviation, power, renewable energy, and healthcare.\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $5.28 at the midpoint, in line with analyst estimates\n\nIs now the time to buy General Electric? Find out in our full research report .\n\nIndustrial conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) reported Q4 CY2024 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations , with sales up 27.2% year on year to $10.81 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.32 per share was 26.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nGeneral Electric has been an optimally-run company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the industrials sector, boasting an average operating margin of 15.5%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, General Electric\u2019s operating margin rose by 11.8 percentage points over the last five years, showing its efficiency has meaningfully improved.\n\nGeneral Electric Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nThis quarter, General Electric generated an operating profit margin of 18.4%, up 2.6 percentage points year on year. Since its gross margin expanded more than its operating margin, we can infer that leverage on its cost of sales was the primary driver behind the recently higher efficiency.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nSadly for General Electric, its EPS declined by 2.4% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 2.8%. However, its operating margin actually expanded during this timeframe, telling us that non-fundamental factors such as interest and taxes affected its ultimate earnings.\n\nGeneral Electric Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nFor General Electric, its two-year annual EPS growth of 65.1% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing industrials companies in recent history.\n\nIn Q4, General Electric reported EPS at $1.32, up from $0.65 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects General Electric\u2019s full-year EPS of $4.60 to grow 14.3%.\n\nKey Takeaways from General Electric\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly General Electric blew past analysts\u2019 revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. In line full-year EPS guidance is also comforting, showing that the business is on track. The stock traded up 6.2% to $200.03 immediately following the results.\n\nSure, General Electric had a solid quarter, but if we look at the bigger picture, is this stock a buy? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

GE\n\nSCHENECTADY \u2014 GE Vernova raked in $10.6 billion in revenue during the last three months of 2024, up 5% from 2023, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nNet income, or profit, during the quarter was $484 million, up $279 million from the same three-month period in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGE Vernova, which has significant operations in downtown Schenectady, just completed its first year after being spun off from General Electric Co. in April. The company\u2019s shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GEV. On Wednesday, the stock was trading for about $423 a share, slightly under its 52-week high of $434.\n\nGE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said during a call Wednesday with Wall Street analysts that demand for new power is driving the company\u2019s growth.\n\nGE Vernova makes power plants, wind turbines and equipment for the electrical grid. The growth of artificial intelligence technologies, which require large data centers and additional power plants to operate them, is driving up demand, along with the company\u2019s revenue. GE Vernova doubled its gas turbine installations in 2023, with more on the way.\n\n\u201cThese agreements are tied to load growth in the U.S., partially driven by data center hyperscaler demand associated with AI,\u201d Strazik said.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDespite the success with traditional fossil fuel generation sales, the company\u2019s offshore wind business has struggled as the offshore wind sector as a whole has struggled amid price inflation and supply chain issues. The issues have led to canceled projects in the U.S., including off the shores of New York state, which had hoped to add offshore wind farms to the state\u2019s electrical grid to meet the state\u2019s renewable energy needs.\n\nStrazik said GE Vernova has a $3 billion backlog in orders for offshore wind, but after that, it is unclear what will happen.\n\n\u201cWe do not foresee adding to the offshore backlog without substantially different industry economics than what we see in the marketplace today,\u201d Strazik said. \u201cLooking ahead, we are applying what we\u2019ve learned from the challenges in offshore wind to make us a stronger company going forward.\u201d\n\nGE Vernova\u2019s nuclear business, based in North Carolina, is also a bright spot. The company has an agreement with several U.S. electric utilities and the Tennessee Valley Authority to build small modular nuclear reactors in the U.S. that are growing in popularity worldwide. The TVA is applying for $800 million in federal funding to build one of the reactors in Tennessee by 2033.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSmall nuclear reactors, which do not emit greenhouse gases that release carbon into the atmosphere, could also help upstate New York\u2019s semiconductor industry, which needs large amounts of power to run its computer chip factories. Gov. Kathy Hochul has said that such modular reactors could benefit the industry\u2019s need for more power while also meeting the strict requirements of the state\u2019s climate change law.\n\nGE Vernova\u2019s Schenectady operations date back to 1887 when Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works company from New York City to Schenectady, which became the headquarters for GE in 1892.\n\nGE eventually became one of the most successful industrial conglomerates in the U.S., with a peak employment in Schenectady of 40,000 workers during World War II.\n\nToday, there are a few thousand workers in Schenectady, although GE Vernova does not reveal exact numbers. GE has spun off into three separate companies in the past two years. In addition to GE Vernova, there are GE HealthCare and GE Aviation. Before the spinoff, GE Vernova was known as GE Power, a division of GE.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDespite moving its headquarters to Cambridge, Mass. in late 2023, when it was still technically part of GE, GE Vernova has invested heavily in its Schenectady site.\n\nLast year, the company said it would invest $22 million to make new advanced generators used in power plants, a venture that will add 150 new jobs.\n\nIn 2023, the company announced a $50 million plan to start making on-shore wind turbines in Schenectady, where GE Vernova also makes gas-powered turbines used in power plants. That created another 200 new jobs. GE Vernova has also spent millions more expanding and upgrading the historic industrial site.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

Investors cheered, sending GE shares up 10% as of 10 a.m. ET.\n\nStrong commercial demand\n\nGE Aerospace was long considered one of the crown jewels inside of the General Electric conglomerate. Now independent, the company is demonstrating to investors what it is capable of. GE earned $1.32 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $10.8 billion, easily surpassing Wall Street's consensus $1.04 per share on $9.5 billion estimates.\n\nFor the year, GE reported profit up 27% to $7.6 billion on revenue up 9% to $38.7 billion.\n\nThe driver of the beat is strong demand for spare parts and services. Production issues at both Boeing and Airbus are forcing commercial airlines to lean heavily on their existing fleet, creating the need for additional maintenance. GE and other aerospace suppliers typically generate lower margins on sales to aircraft manufacturers and make up for it with spare parts and service sales.\n\n\"GE Aerospace delivered a strong finish to 2024 given robust demand for our services and products,\" CEO Larry Culp said in a statement. \"Our performance capped off a monumental first year as a stand-alone company with $1.7 billion of profit growth and $1.3 billion of free cash flow growth.\"\n\nIs GE Aerospace stock a buy?\n\nThe company is optimistic the strong performance can continue, announcing post-earnings it would boost its dividend by 30% and launch a new $7 billion share repurchase plan. Culp forecasted double-digit revenue and earnings growth in the new year and expects to convert all its operating profits in the year to free cash flow.\n\nGE is in the right place at the right time, and this sort of earnings performance is likely not to continue indefinitely. But the company plays an important role in the aerospace supply chain and cannot easily be replaced, making it a good fit for investors looking for long-term growth and income opportunities.",

Locally, the split\u2019s biggest casualty was General Electric\u2019s Global Operations Center at The Banks. This back-office facility that aimed to provide support to GE\u2019s various divisions that was scaled back, then shut down in 2023 as the company broke apart.\n\nGE Aerospace makes and services engines for both commercial and military aircraft. It employs 9,000 employees in Greater Cincinnati or Northern Kentucky. Last year, it announced it would beef up its manufacturing capabilities, investing $107 million into Greater Cincinnati plants as part of a larger $650 million infusion into its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations.\n\nHow does GE Aerospace stack up against Cincinnati\u2019s other Fortune 500s?\n\nFortune ranks the largest companies in the U.S. based on annual sales revenue. General Electric ranked 56th on last year's Fortune 500, but that reflected the latest annual results available from 2023 before the split up was complete and when the company was still headquartered in Boston.\n\nGE Aerospace\u2019s estimated 2024 revenues would make it the region\u2019s third-largest company on the Fortune 500 behind supermarket heavyweight Kroger and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble.\n\nThe other local companies on the list are: regional bank Fifth Third and uniform manufacturer Cintas and insurers Western & Southern Financial Group, Cincinnati Financial and American Financial Group.\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.",

            "content": "Portland General Electric\u2019s plan to upgrade transmission lines in Forest Park fails to show how plants and animals would be protected should it be allowed to remove 4.7 acres of trees for the project, staff at Portland\u2019s Permitting & Development Office said.\n\nThe city agency published its 94-page report in preparation for a hearing on the matter Jan. 29. The report does not block the project. Rather, it presents recommendations to the hearings officer from city staff.\n\nPGE\u2019s plan, which the utility says is necessary to meet electricity demand in the Portland area, has drawn opposition from environmental groups that fear the tree-cutting will destroy habitat for animals such as the pileated woodpecker, sharp-shinned hawk, Roosevelt elk, white-footed vole, and northern red-legged frog, an at-risk species.\n\nPermitting staff recommended denying approval of an environmental review of the project because it would permanently fill two wetlands, impact two streams, and remove 376 living trees and 21 dead ones.\n\nKristen Sheeran, vice president of policy and resource planning at PGE, said the company disagreed with the staff\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cOur land use application meets the land use approval criteria, provides strong justification for these urgent transmission upgrades in Forest Park, and proposes a robust mitigation plan to enhance natural resources, improve biodiversity and habitat, and help reduce the risk of wildfire in and beyond the project area, to improve the park and make it safer,\u201d Sheeran said in a statement. \u201cThough we appreciate city staff\u2019s diligence throughout this process, we disagree with their conclusions and look forward to examining the issues in the upcoming hearing.\u201d\n\nThe PGE lines in question are within existing easements and run parallel to those owned by the Bonneville Power Administration. They are at the northern end of Forest Park, beyond the St. Johns Bridge.\n\nPGE\u2019s plans include shifting the location of one power pole and rewiring a segment of existing transmission line to it, and installing two poles to support a new 1,400-foot transmission line. Both the upgraded and new lines would run from just inside Forest Park, across Highway 30, to PGE\u2019s Harborton substation on the Willamette River.\n\nPGE proposes to restore the logged area by planting a mixture of \u201cshorter-stature tree species,\u201d including Oregon white oaks. It plans to fix disturbed plants by adding a \u201cnative seed mix that contains pollinator-support species.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer and former Mayor Charlie Hales wrote a letter of support for the project in October. Both men worked on the Forest Park Natural Resources Management Plan, which has governed the park since 1995. Blumenauer was city commissioner of public works responsible for planning and transportation. Hales was commissioner of both the Planning Bureau and Parks & Recreation.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the lines existed and, regardless how one might feel about them, were necessary for delivering reliable electricity in our region,\u201d their letter says. \u201cThe plan offers guidance for the city and utilities to collaborate on conservation goals, but does not speak directly to a future need for expanded energy transmission. Our intention was not to prohibit any future development for this purpose. Given the current need for overdue grid improvements here and nationally to ensure reliability, address climate change, and transition to renewable energy, this is something Portland may want to revisit for the sake of clarity.\u201d",

            "content": "For 30 years ending in 1977, GE dumped more than 1 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, into the Hudson River, turning a 200-mile stretch into a superfund site. The EPA ordered GE to dredge a section of the upper Hudson as a result, and ever since GE wrapped that project in 2015, the agency has been monitoring the river to gauge its results.\n\nBut in its third five-year review, the EPA said it still doesn\u2019t have enough data to determine whether or not the dredging was effective, or \u201cprotective,\u201d of the environment. The report has angered a coalition of environmental groups under the moniker \u201cFriends of a Clean Hudson,\u201d including Scenic Hudson.\n\n\"For an organization that prides itself on science and the rule of law, that they continue to refuse to acknowledge their own data...it's an incredible array of emotion, but ultimately condemnation,\" says Peter Lopez, Scenic Hudson's executive director of policy, advocacy and science.\n\nPCBs have been linked to cancer, reproductive issues, and other health concerns. In its review, the EPA said it needs eight years of data on fish and sediment from the Hudson before it can determine whether or not GE\u2019s remedy was protective. It says it gathered an eighth year of data in late 2024, and will add an addendum to its report no later than 2027.\n\nLopez, a former Region 2 administrator for the EPA, says his former colleagues have enough data to know PCB levels aren\u2019t going down enough. Friends of a Clean Hudson released its own report using EPA data in 2023, and found levels had essentially stalled after the dredging.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear in very demonstrable terms that the reduction of PCB is not occurring,\" he says. \"And in some cases, some of the levels have increased.\u201d\n\nLopez says Friends of a Clean Hudson and the EPA are working with the same data, but they\u2019re butting heads on its interpretation. Lopez says the EPA appears to be holding out hope that PCB levels can drop to the standards set in the original Record of Decision that ordered the dredging. But that decision also had interim goals, which Lopez says the project has either blown by or is on track to miss.\n\nWhen he signed off on the EPA\u2019s second five-year review in 2019, Lopez recommended gathering eight years of fish and sediment data to fully understand the situation. But he says the data since shows those interim targets aren\u2019t being met, and it\u2019s not worth waiting to tell GE to go back to the drawing board.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disingenuous to say that another year or so of data collection is going to change the trajectory. It\u2019s not,\" he says.\n\nIn statements, General Electric has maintained that its dredging project \u201cremoved the vast majority of PCBs from the Upper Hudson, led to broad declines in PCB levels, and is on track to deliver further improvements.\u201d\n\nDrew Gamils, an attorney at Riverkeeper, says she\u2019s frustrated but not surprised by the third five-year review \u2014 the EPA released a draft of its report over the summer that essentially said the same thing.\n\nGoing forward, she says Riverkeeper hopes to be included on the EPA\u2019s technical team analyzing data for the addendum. But it also plans to do its own updated analysis, and it\u2019s pushing the EPA to order cleanups on other sections of the superfund site, including the floodplains on each side of the upper Hudson dredging project, and the lower Hudson.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done. This is a milestone for EPA \u2014 a frustrating one, because it hasn\u2019t led to anything else, really. So I don\u2019t know how much of a milestone it really is,\" she adds. \"But there is a lot to do form this point on.\u201d\n\nGamils says swimming in the river is still safe for residents, at least when it comes to PCBs. PCBs build up in the body primarily from eating contaminated fish. Currently, it\u2019s largely recommended to avoid eating fish or crabs from the Hudson River, except in certain areas and in limited amounts.",

Defence officials have confirmed that the team will engage in detailed negotiations covering all aspects of the programme and work towards signing the deal by March.The current negotiations involve the procurement of 99 engines, with potential expansion if the engine is selected for India's fifth-generation aircraft programme. \"The level of transfer of technology promised by GE Aerospace is very high, and it will certainly help in boosting the capabilities of the country in this field,\" defence officials told ANI.According to IDRW, GE has reportedly sought an additional $50 million for the agreement, which increases the scope of Transfer of Technology (ToT) by 22% compared to the 2012 deal. The overall cost of the deal is estimated at around $1 billion at 2023 price levels. HAL has established a Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) to oversee the discussions and has requested specific technical documents from GE to assess the proposed ToT.India has faced challenges due to delays in jet engine supply for its Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A and Mark 2 programmes. The delivery of GE-404 engines for the LCA Mark 1A fleet has been affected by global supply chain disruptions. Officials stated that delays in signing the GE-414 project could impact the induction of the LCA Mark 2, which is designed as a 4.5-generation aircraft to replace Mirage-2000, Jaguar, and MiG-29 fighter jets in the Indian Air Force.India is working towards achieving self-reliance in jet engine manufacturing by collaborating with global manufacturers. \"India has now started working to develop an engine of its own and may be aligning with a global manufacturer soon in this regard,\" sources told India Today TV. The proposed ToT from GE is expected to significantly enhance India's indigenous capabilities in jet engine production.Currently, only a few countries, such as the US, France, the UK, and Russia, possess the capability to manufacture jet engines. Most fighter aircraft worldwide rely on engines from American, Russian, or European manufacturers. India aims to reduce dependency on foreign suppliers through strategic partnerships and technology acquisition.Despite ongoing negotiations, HAL shares traded 0.85% lower at \u20b94,151.80 on Tuesday. The stock has remained flat on a year-to-date basis. Market analysts are closely watching the progress of the deal, given its potential impact on HAL\u2019s financial performance and India's defence sector.The finalisation of the GE-414 engine deal is critical for India's defence modernisation plans. Successful completion by March will be key to ensuring timely production of indigenous fighter aircraft and enhancing national security capabilities.",

            "content": "Promising Projections for GE Vernova\n\nAs GE Vernova prepares to unveil its fourth-quarter earnings report early Wednesday, excitement surges through the markets. The company, which comprises the gas power and renewable energy sectors of former General Electric, has seen its stock experience remarkable growth, skyrocketing to new heights since its launch in April 2024.\n\nAnalysts from Bank of America anticipate a robust quarter, confidently projecting an earnings per share of $2.30 and a revenue of $10.702 billion, marking a staggering 244% year-over-year increase in earnings. Revenues are expected to see a steady rise of 6.6%. Furthermore, forecasts indicate potential for $36.799 billion in revenue for 2025, aligning with the company\u2019s ambitious guidance.\n\nOn the trading floor, GE Vernova shares climbed 1.25%, reflecting a phenomenal rise from $115 at its debut\u2014a remarkable tripling in value. However, the stock remains extended from its breakout point, making it outside the current buying range, despite strong performance metrics.\n\nLooking ahead, GE Vernova\u2019s CEO Scott Strazik highlighted the emerging \u201cinvestment supercycle for the energy transition.\u201d The company anticipates growth driven mainly by its electrification segment, with revenue projections soaring to $45 billion and free cash flow hitting $14 billion by 2028.\n\nDespite recent executive orders regarding wind leasing, analysts remain optimistic, suggesting little impact on GE Vernova\u2019s operations. As the market awaits the earnings announcement, all eyes are on this promising energy player.\n\nImplications of GE Vernova\u2019s Growth on Energy Transition\n\nAs GE Vernova emerges as a frontrunner in the energy sector, its trajectory is set to reverberate across multiple layers of society and the global economy. The company\u2019s anticipated success not only signals a shift in energy generation but also illustrates a broader cultural commitment to sustainable practices. This aligns with a growing global consciousness around climate change and environmental sustainability, where reliance on fossil fuels is increasingly scrutinized.\n\nWith its significant focus on electrification and renewable energy, GE Vernova\u2019s growth underscores the financial viability of green technologies. Investments in clean energy solutions can catalyze job creation across various sectors, from manufacturing to infrastructure development. The potential for economic revitalization stands as a critical pillar of support for the transition toward a low-carbon economy.\n\nMoreover, the environmental implications are noteworthy. As companies like GE Vernova lead in renewable energy, there\u2019s a concerted effort to reduce carbon footprints and mitigate climate impacts. Forecasting trends, the continued growth of the renewables market may encourage industrial giants to pivot away from traditional energy sources, reinforcing a paradigm shift that prioritizes ecological integrity.\n\nIn the long term, GE Vernova\u2019s rise could inspire not just innovation but also competition within the renewables sector, propelling advancements that are crucial for meeting global climate goals. The focus on sustainable energy practices may well stipulate new standards for corporate responsibility, effectively challenging other sectors to reevaluate their environmental impact. Thus, GE Vernova\u2019s promising projections serve as a microcosm for a larger movement towards an equitable, sustainable future.\n\nGE Vernova: Powering Ahead with Promising Projections and Market Optimism\n\nIntroduction\n\nGE Vernova, the newly established wing of General Electric focusing on gas power and renewable energy, has garnered substantial attention ahead of its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report. With remarkable stock growth and optimistic financial projections, GE Vernova is positioned as a significant player in the energy transition landscape.\n\nFinancial Projections\n\nAnalysts from Bank of America have set high expectations for GE Vernova, forecasting an earnings per share (EPS) of $2.30 and total revenues of $10.702 billion for the upcoming quarter. This is a substantial increase, representing a 244% year-over-year growth in earnings. Furthermore, revenues are forecasted to grow by 6.6%, bolstering confidence in the company\u2019s financial health and market position.\n\nMarket Performance and Stock Trends\n\nSince its launch in April 2024, GE Vernova\u2019s stock has seen a staggering rise, climbing 1.25% on recent trading days and experiencing a phenomenal increase from the initial value of $115\u2014nearly tripling since its debut. However, analysts note that the stock is currently stretched beyond its breakout point, placing it outside the immediate buying range despite reflecting strong performance metrics.\n\nGrowth Drivers: Electrification Focus\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Scott Strazik, emphasizes a significant driver of future growth will be through its electrification segment. Projections suggest this segment could alone generate $45 billion in revenues by 2028, with expected free cash flow reaching $14 billion. This focus on electrification underpins GE Vernova\u2019s strategy to capitalize on the global energy transition and the increasing demand for clean energy solutions.\n\nAddressing Regulatory Changes\n\nIn light of recent executive orders affecting wind leasing, market analysts convey that these developments are unlikely to disrupt GE Vernova\u2019s operations significantly. The company\u2019s diversified portfolio and adaptability position it to navigate challenges in the regulatory landscape efficiently.\n\nSustainability and Innovations\n\nAs GE Vernova furthers its commitment to sustainable practices, the company aims to lead in innovating environmentally friendly energy solutions. The emphasis on renewable energy aligns with global sustainability goals, making GE Vernova a critical player in the industry\u2019s shift towards cleaner energy sources.\n\nUse Cases and Market Potential\n\nGE Vernova\u2019s technologies and services will find widespread applications across various sectors, including:\n\n\u2013 Industrial Power Systems: Enhancing energy efficiency and lowering emissions in manufacturing.\n\n\u2013 Renewable Energy Integration: Providing solutions to integrate renewable sources into existing grids, ensuring reliability and sustainability.\n\n\u2013 Electric Vehicle Infrastructure: Supporting the growing demand for electric vehicles through upgraded energy solutions.\n\nLooking Forward: Predictions and Insights\n\nThe energy sector is experiencing an investment supercycle, and GE Vernova is poised to fully leverage this trend. With substantial innovations in renewable energy technology and robust financial backing, analysts predict continued growth and an upward trajectory for both revenues and share prices.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs GE Vernova prepares to release its earnings report, the excitement surrounding its growth potential and market strategies indicates that it will remain at the forefront of the energy transition. Investors and industry watchers alike will be looking closely at the company\u2019s performance and its potential to shape the future of energy.\n\nFor more information about GE Vernova and its initiatives, visit the [official GE website](https://www.ge.com).",

Actual policies supporting EVs, such as the $7,500 tax credit for many EV purchases, remain in place at least for the near term.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, Michigan Democrats said Trump's executive order was already hurting Michigan autoworkers.\n\n\u201cToday, Donald Trump signed an electric vehicle Executive Order, endangering Michigan auto jobs across the state \u2014 with GM\u2019s Factory Zero already idling,\u201d the statement originally said.\n\nIt added: \u201cWith factories already idling because of Trump\u2019s presidency, there is no telling how much more damage he will do to Michigan\u2019s auto jobs,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in the original statement. \u201cNo matter what, Michigan Democrats at every level will continue to fight to keep these high-quality, union jobs right here at home.\u201d\n\nDemocrats revised the statement to remove the reference to Factory Zero and idled plants after inquiries from the Detroit Free Press and GM.\n\n\u201cDue to a misunderstanding and miscommunication, earlier versions of this statement mistakenly reference idling plants in Michigan, which has been corrected,\u201d a spokesperson at the party said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is still targeting key industries here in Michigan and poses a threat to our economy.\u201d\n\nWhy should fact-checking matter?\n\nJosh Pasek, professor of communication and media and political science at the University of Michigan, said the mistake may reflect a growing shift in communication norms \u2014 that getting a political narrative across effectively may be more important today than accuracy.\n\n\u201cThere is increasingly a perception among Democrats that if fact-checking doesn\u2019t matter for the right, why should it matter for the left?\u201d Pasek said.\n\nOn the communication battlefield, \u201cIf one side starts using banned weapons, the side that\u2019s not using that is hobbled.\u201d\n\nThe plant on the Detroit-Hamtramck border has been idle since Dec. 23, when workers went on holiday break, GM spokesman Kevin Kelly told the Free Press. The plant officially closed Jan. 2 for upgrades to the plant\u2019s paint shop. Production is planned to resume Feb. 3.\n\nAuto manufacturers routinely idle factories to increase production capacity, prepare for new models or make other adjustments.\n\nFactory Zero, GM\u2019s electric vehicle plant that straddles Detroit and Hamtramck, builds the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV, and Silverado EV work trucks. Factory Zero is 4.5 million square feet and about 4,537 people worked there as of October 2024, according to GM\u2019s website. The company has invested more than $2.5 billion in the plant.\n\nGM also built Cruise Origin EVs at Factory Zero until GM's self-driving subsidiary Cruise halted production following an Oct. 2, 2023, accident in San Francisco where a Cruise vehicle dragged and injured a pedestrian.\n\nMarick Masters, professor emeritus of business in the Department of Management at the Mike Ilitch School of Business at Wayne State University, said the Michigan Democratic Party\u2019s statement was premature and uninformed. Because of a variety of business factors that go into idling a plant, automakers don't typically respond to political wind changes that quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction that they\u2019re going to move quickly in response to any action he takes,\u201d Masters said. \u201cPeople blame Trump for everything and anything, and it may not have to do with reality.\u201d\n\nAdded Pasek: \u201cIt is important to have common norms of accuracy. This is a case of being really sloppy with the truth, but one that represents a problematic \u2014 and growing \u2014 societal trend.\u201d\n\nJackie Charniga covers General Motors for the Free Press.

            "content": "GE Vernova maintained its 2025 outlook early Wednesday after missing revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of 2024 due to weakness in offshore wind energy. GEV stock rose to a new high, continuing a huge rally for the S&P 500 member since its April 2024 debut.\n\nVernova holds the gas power and renewable energy assets of the former General Electric.\n\nGE Vernova reported earnings of $1.73 a share, more than doubling year over year. It's unclear if that's comparable to FactSet estimates for a 244% spike to $2.30 a share.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $10.56 billion, but that slightly missed estimates for $10.7 billion.\n\nWind orders plunged 41% to $2.031 billion. But power orders swelled 20% to $6.55 billion and electrification orders jumped 118% to $4.79 billion.\n\nFor Q4, GE Vernova highlighted improvement in the wind energy business, which turned \"modestly profitable\" despite tumbling orders, the earnings release said. Onshore wind delivered \"its most profitable quarter in three years\" on 48% revenue growth, and offshore wind reduced losses despite 58% lower revenue. For the year, the wind energy unit slashed losses nearly in half to $588 million. The company said the 41% dive in Q4 orders was mainly driven by \"a large U.S. onshore wind order in the fourth quarter of 2023.\"\n\nGE Vernova on Wednesday reaffirmed 2025 guidance of $36 billion-$37 billion in revenue and $2 billion-$2.5 billion in free cash flow. It also touted \"significant margin expansion and cash generation.\"\n\nFor 2025, analysts anticipate Vernova earnings of $6.87 a share, a 57% increase from 2024, FactSet shows.\n\nGE Vernova Stock\n\nIn Wednesday's stock market trading, GEV stock rose 2.7%, to 427.09, reaching the best level since its debut last year.\n\nIn intraday action, GE Vernova stock hit the profit-taking sell zone from its Jan. 6 breakout past a 357.09 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts. The energy spinoff reached that area relatively quickly, meaning investors could use the eight-week hold rule for stocks breaking out of proper bases and showing the potential for further gains.\n\nVernova stock has more than tripled from its April 2024 debut price of $115.\n\nThe relative strength line rose to a new high on Wednesday as well, a favorable sign. The RS line, the blue line in the chart shown, measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500.\n\nGE Aerospace reports earnings early Thursday. GE Health Care is due Feb. 13. The three companies were carved out of General Electric, bringing GE's big breakup to a close.\n\nGE Aerospace stock edged up near a buy point on Wednesday. GE stock flashed an early buy point on Jan. 14. GE Health Care stock lost a cent per share near a buy point.\n\nEnergy Outlook: 'Investment Supercycle'\n\nOn Wednesday, GE Vernova maintained that 2025 resultswill be led by mid-to-high-teens growth in its electrification segment. It continues to see mid-single-digit growth in the gas power segment, offset by a mid-single-digit decline for wind energy.\n\nBy 2028, GE Vernova expects to generate $45 billion in revenue and $14 billion in free cash flow, it has previously said. GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik had cited \"the investment supercycle for the energy transition,\" which he said is gaining momentum.\n\nYear to date, Vernova stock is now up almost 30% after its triple-digit rally since last April.\n\nTrump Is No Fan Of Wind Turbines\n\nDuring his inauguration Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to temporarily withdraw offshore wind leasing in areas of the continental shelf. That \"is consistent with campaign promises and does not come as a surprise,\" RBC analysts said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would halt the issuance and renewal of onshore and offshore wind permits pending a review of the federal wind leasing and permitting practices.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets said they do not expect the announcement to materially impact GE Vernova stock. They cited Vernova's \"limited exposure to offshore wind in the U.S. and limited onshore wind development on federal land.\"",

Their price targets range from $361 to $446, with the average at about $392 sitting below Friday's record level after a strong week for the stock. Shares of GE Vernova gained nearly 3% Friday to close at an all-time high of $401.41, and have nearly tripled in value since their April debut.\n\nThe company is expected to report revenue of $10.73 billion for the final quarter of 2024, up from $10.04 billion in the same time last year, when it was still part of General Electric. Net income is expected to come in at $634.87 million, after two of the company's first three quarters as a standalone company have resulted in net losses.\n\nWind Segment Profitability in Focus\n\nThe company said in previous quarters that its wind segment, the lone unprofitable arm of GE Vernova's three divisions, should be \"approaching profitability\" by the end of the fiscal year. The company said the shift will take time as it moves away from higher-cost offshore wind projects.\n\nAnalysts have upgraded GE Vernova or lifted their price targets several times since it became its own company, including Bank of America analysts earlier this week.\n\nThey have cited the growing demand for energy, especially in renewable forms, to power projects like data centers and artificial intelligence products as a positive catalyst for GE Vernova's sales going forward.\n\nThe other former GE divisions, GE Aerospace (GE) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), are set to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 23 and Feb. 13, respectively.\n\n",

Touch screens and the ability to track and maintain your food supplies were touted as being easy to use, reliable, and life-changing. In reality, those early systems required more manual labor than most users anticipated, and manufacturers changed focus to devices that connect to Wi-Fi and allow for basic functions through an app. Of course, those connections work both ways, and manufacturers are also able to collect data on users, which in turn is used for advertising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some, that's too invasive, so nearly half of all smart appliances remain disconnected from the internet. Smart fridges are also generally more expensive than their standard counterparts \u2014 whether a smart refrigerator is worth it for you and your household depends on your situation.\n\nTech is kind of our thing here at SlashGear, and some of the fun in watching manufacturers race to a new frontier is in the innovative risks that are taken. With that in mind, we've done research into the major smart fridge brands and ranked them from worst to best. These rankings are the result of review scores from trusted sites like Consumer Reports, as well as customer ratings and sales data from major appliance retailers like The Home Depot, Lowes, and Best Buy.

I\u2019ve had hands-on experience in the kitchen for over three decades, and am confident my top picks will help you serve up delicious meals every time.\n\nTo determine which electric ranges are best, I\u2019ve done the research and selected the top picks based on power, performance, range of settings, along with user ease, additional features and overall design. For instance, you might want a double oven, the flexibility of an air frying function or the best budget choice. We\u2019ve taken all of these factors into account when making our selection.\n\nBased on our extensive research, our best overall pick is the GE Profile PB9654, which provides flexible cooking with five burners. Next up is our budget choice, the HiSense HBE3501CPS, providing all the basic functions you need at an affordable price, plus, it has the added bonus of being self-cleaning.\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s lots of other options available including slide-in, dual-fuel versions and one\u2019s with induction cooktops.

Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nGE Profile PB965YPFS (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\n1. GE Profile PB965 Best electric range with double oven Specifications Type: Free-standing Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 6.6 cubic feet Burners and power: 5; 3100, 3000, 1200 (2), 80 (warming burner) Features: Power boil, griddle zones, warming zone, Wi-Fi Storage Drawer: No App Control: Yes Today's Best Deals View at P.C. Richard & Son View at AJ Madison Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Five burners with four heating options + Double oven flexibility + Smart features Reasons to avoid - No storage drawer\n\nIf your home often seems like a restaurant, then you'll need an oven that can handle the constant output of food. The GE Profile PB965 has two ovens that can run independently, so you can cook two different items at different temperatures at the same time. On top the oven provides space for a single rack that's great for pizzas and casseroles, while below the larger capacity oven is suitable for cooking a whole roast, with a total capacity of 6.7 cu. ft.\n\nIt also offers an air-fry function, which doesn\u2019t require preheating, a basket or a special tray, allowing you to enjoy crispy food without the oil in a shorter cooking time. The only drawback is that with the added capacity, there is no space to store baking trays.\n\nWhat Consumers Say With an average rating of 4.6 out of 592 reviews at P.C. Richard & Son, buyers loved the air fry function and said \u201cthe stovetop is great or different sized pots and pans\u201d. They also found that the Wi-Fi app works well.\n\nYou also get five burners with power ranging from 3100W for quick boils to only 80W for keeping the pot roast warm. It also has griddle zone, where two burners work together to create an even heat, ideal for griddles, grills or large cookware.\n\n\n\nFor added convenience you can monitor your oven from anywhere using the SmartHQ app on your smartphone, keeping you in control even when you\u2019re not in the kitchen. You can preheat, set timers, change the temperature, and receive notifications all on your smartphone, allowing you to get more done at once.\n\n\n\nPlus, for easy cleaning, the appliance is made with fingerprint resistant stainless steel, enabling you to simply wipe away smudges and fingerprints to keep your range gleaming.\n\nBest budget electric range\n\nHiSense HBE3501CPS (Image credit: Lowes/HiSense)\n\n2. HiSense HBE3501CPS Best budget electric range Specifications Type: Free-standing Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 5.8 cubic feet Burners and power: 5; 3300, 3000, 2 x 1200, 100 Features: Air Fry, Dehydrate, Pizza Bake, Keep Warm, Bread proofing, convection bake, Roast, Frozen bake, Broil Storage Drawer: Yes App Control: No Today's Best Deals View at Lowe's Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Plenty of cooking power + Self-cleaning oven Reasons to avoid - Only two oven racks\n\nThe best electric range for budget shoppers will provide the basic functions and a few more at a good price. The HiSense HBE3501CPS has everything that most cooks will need, including a self and steam cleaning function, which eliminates the need for scrubbing or chemical cleaners \u2014 a task we can all thankfully do without spending hours cooking a roast.\n\nIt has five burners, with an impressive Power Boil burner of 3200W, when you want to boil water fast, and it also includes a warming burner at 100W, when you require minimal heat without the risk of burning. The burners can also be adjusted to suit your pot's size, with two burners for 12/9 inch or 9/6 inch pans.\n\nWhat Consumers Say This electric range scored a 4.1 rating out of 481 reviews at Lowes. Reviewers say \"It's very well made, with a nice heavy oven door and bottom splash guards for easy clean up\", and \"Rapid boil is a wonderful thing\", and the warming element is also popular. However reviewers say the glass top can easily crack and customer service is poor.\n\nThe 5.8 cubic-foot oven is big enough for a turkey or several baking dishes, but if you are looking for a double oven it is not for you. Plus, it only has two oven racks, which might be a problem if you like to batch bake cookies. But if does offer a super-fast pre-heat setting, saving time when you need to cook in a hurry. The 11 cooking programs give you the flexibility to cook the foods you love, including air fry, pizza bake, frozen bake, bread proofing, and more. With everything controlled via the smooth touch control panel.\n\n\n\nAlthough this electric range doesn't offer any smart functionality, we think it packs a punch on capacity, settings and capacity, making it our best value pick.\n\n\n\nThis product is a new inclusion, as the best budget electric range that we previously recommended, the GE GRF600AVSS, has limited stock availability.\n\nBest slide-in electric range\n\nBosch 800 Series HEI8046U (Image credit: Bosch)\n\n3. Bosch 800 Series HEI8056U Best slide-in electric range Specifications Type: Slide-in Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 4.6 cubic feet Burners and power: 5; 3,200, 3,000, 2 x 1,200, 100 Features: Convection oven, self-cleaning cycle Warming drawer: Yes App Control: No Today's Best Deals View at AJ Madison View at Best Buy View at Lowe's Reasons to buy + Heavy-duty construction, upscale design + Warming drawer + Self-cleaning oven Reasons to avoid - Small oven\n\nA slide-in range gives you the upscale look of a built-in unit. While the Bosch 800 Series HEI8056U is pricier than most free-standing models, it's a lot less expensive than a custom-fitted or professional-style range but will still be a significant upgrade when it comes to aesthetics. It has a heavy-duty construction, a glass panel, and metal control knobs for the cooktop, with a touch panel for the oven. We like the flush look and that the controls are at the front of the appliance rather than sitting on a back panel.\n\n\n\nIn line with its heavy-duty construction, its glide racks make it easy to slide in and out of the oven's 4.6 cubic feet space.\n\n\n\nWhat Consumers Say This product gained a 4.5 star rating out of 257 reviews at P.C. Richard & Son. Reviewers like the slide-in design, and that \u201cit has all the controls on the front\u201d, and \u201cthe three racks in the oven allow plenty of food to be cooked\u201d, plus \u201cit cooks and bakes to perfection\u201d.\n\nYou do sacrifice some oven space with this model. While you will be able to fit in the turkey, you may not be able to pack in as many side dishes at once. Below the oven, in place of storage space, there's a warming drawer that will come in handy when you're throwing a party. The warming drawer could be a good option if you enjoy baking bread, although it is of limited height, so it\u2019s probably best for proofing rolls rather than large loaves.\n\nAs you would expect at this price, the oven is self-cleaning, with a 2, 3 and 4 hours self-clean cycle.\n\nBest electric range with two ovens\n\nLG LDE4415ST (Image credit: Whirlpool)\n\n4. Whirlpool WGE745C0FS Best electric range with two ovens Specifications Type: Freestanding Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 4.2/2.5 cubic feet Burners and power: 5 Features: Dual oven; convection oven; Aqua-Lift self-cleaning technology, Frozen Bake Storage Drawer: No App Control: No Today's Best Deals View at Lowe's View at AJ Madison Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Dual ovens can cook independently + Five burners give plenty of heating options Reasons to avoid - No storage drawer\n\nIf your home often seems like a restaurant, then you'll need an oven that can handle the constant output of food. The Whirlpool WGE745C0FS has two ovens that can run independently, so you can cook two different items at different temperatures at the same time. On top there's a 2.5-cubic-foot oven that's great for pizzas and casseroles, while below there's a larger, 4.2-cubic-foot one for roasts or multiple sheets of snickerdoodles. It offers a combined capacity of 6.7-cubic-feet, giving you plenty of scope to feed a crowd.\n\nWhat Consumers Say Receiving a 4.5 star rating out of 692 reviews at Best Buy, reviewers love the double oven function and the design of the range. They say, \u201cThe smaller, upper oven, takes less time to heat up\u201d and \u201cI enjoy being able to bake a cake using the top and baking a turkey in the bottom\u201d.\n\nThe range also features convection cooking, which lets you cook food faster. And you can easily achieve the right convection cooking temperature, as the oven automatically converts it for you. It also features a FlexHeat Triple Radiant Element \u2014 offering three elements in one to give you the correct heat for your pan size. We love these energy saving features.\n\n\n\nWe also love the Frozen Bake Technology, which allows you to save time by skipping on preheat and cooking frozen pizza, lasagna, chicken nuggets, and fries, straight from the freezer. Perfect for those days when you\u2019re in a rush and don\u2019t have time to cook from scratch\n\nPlus, to make cleaning easy, it features a steam clean option which will keep your oven clean from light spills without the need of harsh chemicals, along with AquaLift self-cleaning technology. Do keep in mind that with this design you don't get a storage drawer at the bottom. Although it does come in a choice of three finishes \u2014 stainless steel, black or white.\n\nBest smart electric range\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\n\n5. Samsung NE63A6711SG/AA Best smart electric range Specifications Type: Freestanding Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 6.3 cubic feet Burners and power: 5; 1800 (2), 3000, 1200, 100 W Features: Convection setting, Air Fry and Griddle Storage Drawer: Yes App Control: Yes, Bixby, Google Assistant, SmartThings Today's Best Deals View at Samsung View at Best Buy Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Useful settings including Convection and Air Fry + Includes a griddle + One burner is adjustable to suit different pan sizes Reasons to avoid - Doesn\u2019t work with Amazon Alexa\n\nIf you want a smart range, then it doesn\u2019t get much better than the Samsung NE63A6711SG/AA. Using the SmartThings app, you can access recipes, plan out meals and you can even order any missing ingredients. You can also preheat, monitor and adjust the time and temperature wherever you are using your smartphone, available on Android and IOS devices, although you will need a Wi-Fi connection and a Samsung account.\n\nIt comes with some useful settings too, including a no-preheat Air Fry and tray, which cooks in the same manner as the popular appliance, and the option to choose convection cooking, which will provide more even cooking \u2014 ideal for baking.\n\nWhat Consumers Say Gaining a 4.6 star rating out of 654 reviews at Best Buy, users love all the features, especially the griddle burner and air fryer, and \u201cit\u2019s all easily programmed with the Digital Touch system\u201d. They also say the \u201cstainless steel design with the black glass top is stunning\u201d.\n\nThis large 6.3 cubic-foot oven can fit multiple dishes including a large turkey for Thanksgiving. While the cooktop features 5 burners, including a griddle burner and adjustable dual and triple ring burners, allowing you to cook with the griddle included and multiple pot and pan sizes. The griddle sits nicely on the griddle burner on top, and when not in use it can be tidied away in the range\u2019s storage drawer.\n\nThis appliance has been made to make your life easier. Its four preset buttons include bread proof, dehydrate, keep warm and favorite cook.\n\nIt has two cleaning options \u2014 Self and Steam Clean. To burn off tough grease and food residue, select Self Clean, and for easier clean-ups choose Steam Clean, which takes 20 minutes. Although, some users report that the cooktop is tricky to keep clean and that the griddle pan can scratch the surface.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s available in a traditional stainless steel finish, or you can opt for the Tuscan or Black stainless steel, which is much more eye-catching.\n\nBest electric range with an air fryer\n\n(Image credit: LG)\n\n6. LG LREL6325F Best electric range with an air fryer Specifications Type: Free-standing Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 6.3 cubic feet Burners and power: 5; 3200, 3000, 1200 (2), 100 W Features: Air Fry; Convection oven; Easy Clean and Self-cleaning cycle Storage Drawer: Yes App Control: Yes Today's Best Deals View at Best Buy View at Amazon View at Sears Reasons to buy + Large oven + Air fry capabilities + Five burners of varying power + Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and recipe apps Reasons to avoid - Air fryer basket isn\u2019t included\n\nIn addition to being a state-of-the-art electric range, the LG LREL6325F has air frying capabilities, eliminating the need to buy still another countertop cooking appliance, unless of course, you require the extra capacity. You might get a surprise when you open the oven door, as it has an attractive bright blue interior. The large 6.3 cu. ft. convection oven can fit a 20lb turkey, while it provides 5 elements of varying power on the cooktop. One is designed for keeping soup or stew warm for second helpings, while a 3200 element aids fast boiling.\n\nThis range is equipped with the latest smart features. To see how your banana bread or meat loaf is progressing, you knock twice on the glass oven window and the light comes on. This is a handy feature to save you opening the door to see your cake or bread deflate.\n\nWhat Consumers Say Scoring a star rating of 4.3 out of 1,702 reviews at Lowes, consumers love the blue color inside the oven and the touch light on the oven door, which allows you to easily see inside. However, the \u201cglass top is difficult to clean and scratches easily\u201d and some say it takes the \u201cburners a long time to heat up\u201d.\n\nYou can monitor and control the range with an app on your phone or by giving voice commands to Alexa or Google Assistant. The range also connects to cooking apps, which automatically send temperature settings to the oven. You can use the app to diagnose problems before you call a service technician, saving you time and possibly money.\n\nIt also offers two cleaning options \u2014 choose the 10-minute EasyClean cycle, or the deep clean, self-clean. Plus, to keep your baking sheets tidy, they can be stored in the drawer below the oven.\n\nBest electric range with induction stove\n\n(Image credit: Bosch)\n\n7. Bosch HII8057U Best electric range with induction stove Specifications Type: Slide-in Fuel: Electric Oven Size: 4.6 cubic feet Burners and Power: 4 Features: Induction Cooktop; Convection Oven; Broiler in oven; Speed Boost; Self-Clean Storage Drawer: Yes App Control: No Today's Best Deals View at P.C. Richard & Son View at AJ Madison View at Lowe's Reasons to buy + Features an induction stove + Slide-in design + Self-clean setting mode + Convection oven Reasons to avoid - The pans need to fit the burners exactly to work\n\nThe Bosch 800 Series HII8057U is a smart-looking electric range with flush features and a sleek digital control panel on the front, although it is pricey.\n\n\n\nIt features an ample 4.6 cubic feet capacity interior, meaning you have plenty of space for family dinners, although you won't be cooking up a banquet. The convection oven allows for even bakes, with multiple racks and a third element that circulates heat evenly for consistent bakes wherever the food is placed in the oven. It also has a handy warming drawer that doubles up as a proofing drawer \u2013 ideal if you love to bake bread or dislike eating on cold plates.\n\nWhat Consumers Say This appliance gains a 4.5 star rating out of 68 reviews at Lowes. Users like the flat touch panel and induction cooktop, which gives it a sleek modern look, and say \u201cI love the pizza mode and the flash heat up mode\u201d. However, it's easy to turn off the controls if you brush past them.\n\nThe standout feature for this electric range is the induction stove. While you will need to invest in some induction pans to use this feature, it works much faster than traditional ceramic and provides precise cooking. It\u2019s safer to use as well because the stove won\u2019t heat up unless it detects the pan. It provides the instant response of gas, without the difficulty of cleaning up afterwards. However, you will need to ensure the pans fit the burners accurately, or it won\u2019t work!\n\nThe glass controls and flat stove also make cleaning an easy task, although the controls are sensitive and can be activated when leaned against. Plus, the glass cooktop overlaps the adjoining countertop, which avoids spillages running down the side of the appliance.\n\nHow we picked\n\nOur tester\n\nCamilla Sharman Staff Writer Camilla oversees the kitchen appliance guides at Tom\u2019s Guide and has honed her experience working as a journalist for digital and print, covering all things home. She has a particular interest in kitchen appliances, as that\u2019s where she spends most of her spare time. She has reviewed and tested stand mixers, meat thermometers and bread makers, and researches the best large kitchen appliances to include in our reviews.\n\nResearch\n\nWe conduct extensive research online to find the best electric ranges. We look at a wide range of electric ranges and make our selection based on those that gain high star ratings and positive reviews. We include these insights in our product descriptions.\n\nWhat we consider\n\nWe also look for appliances that offer a range of specifications and consider the oven capacity, the number and power of the burners, the number of oven racks, and whether they are adjustable or telescopic. Plus, we consider any self-cleaning features, such as steam cleaning or self-cleaning functions, and identify whether the range has an additional storage drawer to keep plates warm or baking sheets and tins neat and tidy.\n\nWhen researching our selection, we also review how easy and practical the range is to use and the attractiveness of the design. We look for extra functionality, such as no preheat or air fry, and whether there\u2019s a broiler or app control.\n\nOnce we\u2019ve conducted our research, we categorize the best electric ovens. Here, we can recommend the best electric range overall, the best budget, or the best premium. We also consider other main factors to help you decide on the best electric range for your circumstances, such as the best electric range with two ovens or the best smart range.\n\nKeep up to date\n\nWe also regularly check the products to ensure they haven\u2019t been discontinued. If they have, we update them with alternatives, which we\u2019ve considered using the same process as above.\n\nHow to choose the best electric range\n\nHow to choose the best electric range for you\n\nType: When shopping for a new range, there are three types you will have to consider. Free-standing models come with a backsplash and can stand \u2018freely\u2019 as the name suggests. Slide-in models slide into a bay between counters, which provides a custom look for less money than a built-in model. Built-in ranges need to be fitted into a cavity, usually sitting on top of a drawer. These are more rare and bespoke that the other two types. In this guide, we mainly focused on free-standing models, as they tend to be the most popular as well as the most affordable.\n\nSize: Depending on the space you want to fit it in, the typical, 'standard' size range is about 30 inches wide, 27\u201329 inches deep and 36 inches tall. If you have a large household, or need an extra burner for instance, the standard range size is 36 inches wide. Of course, don't forget to allow space for grates, handles or knobs.\n\nShould you invest in dual fuel? If you have access to gas via a natural gas line or a liquid propane tank in your yard, then there\u2019s also the option of buying a dual-fuel model. Dual-fuel ranges feature a gas stove above an electric oven. With this design, you get the benefit of better control from the burners, although an electric stove is quicker to heat and easier to clean, so bear that in mind. If you prefer a gas stove, but want the evenness of an electric oven, this design might be best.\n\nWhat about induction? An induction stove will give you the same speedy response as gas as well as being quick to boil and easy to clean. It uses an electromagnetic field to heat up magnetized pots and pans, meaning the surface itself doesn\u2019t actually heat. However, if you opt for an induction stove, you may need to buy pans which are compatible.\n\nFor full details, see induction vs. electric cooktop: Which type is better for you? Keen to learn more? I test appliances for a living \u2014 here are 9 oven tips you need to know.\n\nGas vs Electric\n\nYou may be unsure whether you want to invest in one of the best gas ranges or electric range. Each comes with its pros and cons which should be taken into consideration before you decide.\n\nAn electric stove is much quicker to heat and easier to clean as it\u2019s a flat surface. Although, it retains the heat for some time after you switch it off which isn\u2019t great if you have pets or children. It\u2019s also tricky to control as it\u2019s not as responsive as gas. The glass can be damaged easily though, check out how to prevent scratches on your glass stove for tips to avoid this.\n\nIn terms of the oven, an electric range will provide a more even heat distribution, which lowers the chance of hot spots. This fuel type will also produce a dry texture, which is great for crisping. These are more expensive to run on a daily basis however.\n\nA gas stove is easier to control and much more responsive, however they\u2019re more time consuming to clean thanks to the grates. The elements are also slower to heat compared to electric. Looking at the oven, heat distribution isn\u2019t as even, but it is much faster so preheating won\u2019t take as long. Gas ovens also produce a moist texture which is brilliant for roasts. These are cheaper to run on top of this. Ever wondered which is cheaper: air fryer vs oven, we've found the answer.\n\nWhen to replace an electric range\n\nMost electric range brands offer a one-year warranty, but according to the National Association of Home Builders, you can expect yours to last about 13 years. We don\u2019t recommend the extended warranty, since repairs within your range\u2019s lifetime typically cost less than the warranty itself.\n\nIf the repair cost is fifty percent or more than the price of a new range you\u2019ll want to think about replacing it. The most common range complaints are that the temperature isn\u2019t correct. Check the manual and see if you can recalibrate your oven yourself. If you can\u2019t, or that doesn\u2019t solve the problem, a serviceperson may be able to fix the oven without charging an astronomical price. Specific elements that break, including the glass ceramic top, can be easily replaced quite cheaply. However replacing a circuit board will be expensive and you\u2019re best buying a new range.\n\nThe best replacement for a coil range is a smoothtop range. Not only are they easier to clean, they also come with the latest features. Even newer glass ceramic top models have updates that weren\u2019t available a few years ago. All ranges come with at least one power burner for boiling water, stir frying or stovetop grilling; they will also have at least one burner to keep food at a steady simmer. For using a griddle or poacher, you\u2019ll find bridge burners. Below the stovetop convection ovens are available with temperature probes and warming drawers for moderate prices. These ovens often have pre-set settings for specific foods or functions like turkey or pizza, air frying, or proofing bread.\n\nYou may want to consider upgrading to an induction range. Prices on these high tech appliances have come down considerably in the last few years. Induction gives you the instant response of gas burners and brings water to a boil much faster.\n\nMore and more ranges connect to WiFi, allowing you to preheat or control your oven from your phone, Alexa or Google Assistant. Some smart ranges can diagnose problems and in some cases, alert the service center. Look for models that connect with recipe apps and automatically apply the correct times and temperatures. Regardless, you should invest in one of the best meat thermometers to make sure you don't overcook anything.\n\nAnother useful setting is the self-clean function \u2014 your oven can clean itself with this underrated setting. But, if you don't have it, you will need to learn how to clean an oven from scratch.\n\nElectric range FAQS",

            "content": "The new Electric Launch System for Unmanned Aircraft allows UAS operations on a variety of vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers and expeditionary sea bases.\n\nGeneral Atomics has unveiled a new \u201cElectric Launch System for Unmanned Aircraft\u201d to be installed on a variety of vessels to support UAS operations. The company says the system is part of a broader effort to support the launching of drones in constrained environments both on land and at sea.\n\nAmong the vessels which would be able to use the system, which is based on a scalable design, are aircraft carriers, destroyers and expeditionary sea bases. Specifically, General Atomics mentioned the Royal Navy\u2019s Daring-class (Type 45) destroyer and Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, as well as the U.S. Navy\u2019s Expeditionary Sea Base ships and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\u2019s Izumo-class destroyer.\n\nThe rendering of the launch system on a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier shows the catapult installed beside the ski jump used by the F-35B. Also, the render shows an UAS of the sister company General Atomics Aeronautical Systems\u2019 Gambit series, specifically the carrier-capable Gambit 5 first shown at the Farnborough International Airshow 2024.\n\n\u201cAs you know, with the proliferation of RPAS [Remotely Piloted Aircraft System] worldwide, whether on land or sea, we\u2019ve been asked to look at the launch of RPAS in very small footprint from Navy vessels. It\u2019s been looked at primarily Europe right now. Possibly over in the Indo-Pacific area too,\u201d said Gary Hopper, Vice President of Strategic Development at General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, in an interview to Naval News, which first published the news.\n\nGeneral Atomic already manufactures another launch system, the ElectroMagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) used on the Ford-class aircraft carriers of the U.S. Navy and, in future, the PANG (Porte-Avions de Nouvelle Generation/Next Generation Aircraft Carrier) of the French Navy. However, the company says that the new system, first shown at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium this week, is \u201centirely different\u201d from EMALS.\n\nCompared to EMALS, the drone launcher requires a minimal footprint on a vessel with the company claim that it only needs a 4 foot by 2 foot installation area. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same redundancy, same requirements you have for manned flight. So it\u2019s a lot simpler system that (can be) put on, possibly some the British carriers or other vessels,\u201d said Hopper.\n\nThere are also other applications for this concept for other NATO countries, although the company is still working on them, as well as land-based solutions. For instance, the sister company General Atomics Aeronautical Systems is examining this concept for the launch of Collaborative Combat Aircraft from land-based airfields.\n\n\u201cThere are other we\u2019re looking at, some other examples, other NATO countries. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a NATO initiative to look at putting it on aircraft. So we use that particular vessel, but there are other vessels out there, again, similar, similar size. In fact, we\u2019re talking about takeoff distance of 22 meters, not very long at all,\u201d said Hopper.\n\nGambit 5\n\nGambit is a family of high-performance autonomous combat aircraft based on a common \u2018chassis\u2019, known as the \u2018Gambit Core\u2019. The Gambit variants differ by their airframe, wing, engine, sensors and/or weapons, each addressing different mission sets. This is the same approach of the \u2018genus/species\u2019 concept which GA-ASI developed with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) as part of the Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS) program.\n\nBefore Gambit 5, the company already mentioned four different variants: Gambit 1, focused on Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Gambit 2, which integrates air-to-air weapons\u2019 employment; Gambit 3, a high-fidelity target drone; Gambit 4, a stealthy, long endurance ISR drone.\n\nThe rendering shared by the company shows the aircraft being seemingly based on Gambit 2, although C. Mark Brinkley, GA-ASI\u2019s senior director for strategic communications and marketing, says it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be weaponized and could be intended as a carrier-capable ISR asset. Obviously, to operate from a carrier, the drone needs modifications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that has to go into making the Gambit 5 carrier-capable [in terms of] the catapult launch and arrested landing. How do you reinforce the landing gear? How do you add the tail hook? How do you \u2018marinize\u2019 the airframe? All those considerations come into play,\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reinforcing aircraft to take off and land on aircraft carrier for a very long time. There\u2019s no specifically new science to that.\u201d\n\nWhen it was unveiled, GA-ASI said it currently had no plans to build a prototype of Gambit 5. However, the company mentioned that they expect this project to generate interest as a number of nations are interested in integrating Autonomous Collaborative Platform concept into their ships.\n\nGA\u2019s drone testing on carriers\n\nIn the past few years, General Atomics tested fixed wing drones from aircraft carriers, although they did not require the use of catapults. Specifically, in 2023 the company tested the Mojave RPAS on the Royal Navy\u2019s HMS Prince of Wales, while in 2024 it was the turn of the Gray Eagle STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing), Mojave\u2019s production variant, to be tested on the Republic of Korea Navy\u2019s amphibious landing ship Dokdo.\n\nMojave, which is nine meters long, with a wingspan of 17 meters and a weight of more than one and a half tons fully loaded, became the first uncrewed aircraft of this size to fly from an aircraft carrier outside the U.S. Navy. The takeoff of Mojave, which was controlled by a crew from a control station onboard the ship, was performed at an angle, without using the ski jump normally used by the F-35B. The demonstration included takeoff, circuits around the ship and approaches, ending with a landing back onto the carrier without using any form of arrestor gear.\n\nThe activity of the Gray Eagle STOL was part of an evaluation of the RoKN, meant to test the integration of fixed-wing drones onboard the ship. In that occasion, the Gray Eagle STOL took off from the Dokdo in the East Sea and landed at the Pohang Naval Aviation Command airfield, after maintaining communication throughout the hour-long journey with the Dokdo while operating over the sea and then transferring the control to RoKN\u2019s aviation\u2019s ground control.\n\nThe Gray Eagle STOL is a STOL Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS that General Atomics developed from the MQ-1C Gray Eagle-Extended Range. The objective was to create a drone suited for expeditionary operations from forward-bases without the need for typical paved runways or infrastructure.\n\nLike the Gray Eagle ER, the Gray Eagle STOL can be equipped with a sensor suite including EO/IR, Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) to support land or maritime missions. However, its payload is doubled compared to the original Gray Eagle as its increased wing surface area allows it to carry up to 3,600 lb (1,633 kg), which totals as many as 16 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.\n\nIn fact, Gray Eagle STOL has different engines, wings, control surfaces and landing gear, which are modified to obtain much improved STOL performance. The aircraft is the only medium-altitude, long-endurance aircraft of its kind that can operate from large-deck warships such as amphibious ships, aircraft carriers, and unimproved, austere runways and airfields on land.",

Luckily both of us were several feet away at the time, and were not injured. \u2026 Over the next couple of weeks we had regular phone conversations with GE. They consisted of 10-20 minutes of hold time and various reps saying they couldn't do anything.\"\n\nThe stove was deemed unsafe to repair, and GE didn't offer any compensation.\n\nWhy is this concerning?\n\nThis isn't the first time a gas stove has exploded. One user in the comments had the exact same thing happen \u2014 their GE Profile range exploded, and GE wasn't any help. This Redditor's GE gas stove shattered while they were cooking, and all GE did was offer them a discount.\n\nUnfortunately, gas stoves pose additional risks beyond exploding. Burning gas releases chemicals like benzene, which is a carcinogen, and researchers are becoming increasingly concerned with the effects of daily exposure.\n\nSome models were recalled by GE because of this issue. Commenters encouraged the user to take action to ensure nobody else gets hurt.\n\n\"I would file a complaint with the BBB, you can do it online and there's no charge,\" one user said.\n\nWhat can I do to avoid this?\n\nElectric and induction stovetops are safer than their gas counterparts, and they can save you money, too. Electric and induction stoves use electricity or magnets to heat metal coils \u2014 no gas involved.\n\nSwitching from gas to electric or induction is cheaper than ever, thanks to available rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. You can get a high-quality stainless steel induction range from Copper for just $4,100 with the federal tax credit. Plus, Copper's induction ranges come with a two-year warranty \u2014 twice as long as what you'd get with General Electric.\n\nYou're paying for more than just peace of mind \u2014 an induction stovetop is more energy-efficient and will cook your food faster. According to Consumer Reports, \"Induction burners can boil a pot of water roughly 20 to 40 percent faster than the best gas and radiant electric ranges and cooktops.\"\n\nIf you're looking for something safe, inexpensive, and efficient, an induction stovetop is the way to go. But if you're interested in switching out your stovetop, don't wait \u2014 these IRA rebates might not be around much longer.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund\u2019s assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness\u2019 investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR\u2019s flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC\u2019s Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn\u2019t harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn\u2019t short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness\u2019 criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment\u2019s Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management\u2019s stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE)\n\nAQR Capital Management\u2019s stake as of Q3: $606.3 million\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), the aerospace spin-off of the General Electric conglomerate, is a leading player in the industry, specializing in the production of jet engines and propulsion systems for a wide range of aircraft, including commercial airliners, military jets, and private planes. Its customers include major industry giants including the likes of Boeing and Airbus, as well as the U.S. military.\n\nThe company\u2019s defense segment is performing exceptionally well, evidenced by GE receiving an order from the Polish Ministry of National Defense for 210 T700 engines to power 96 Boeing AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters. The company also announced a ten-year, multi-million-dollar service agreement with Emirates back in October of last year, focusing on the electrical load management system for its Boeing 777 fleet.\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) generated $9.8 billion in revenue, indicating a 6% improvement year-over-year. Its GAAP profit came in at $1.9 billion indicating an even better year-over-year growth rate of 14%. The company also improved its total orders by 28% to reach $12.6 billion in total secured orders indicating that demand for its products remains robust.\n\nOverall GE ranks 6th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of GE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "January 1, 1966 \u2013 Following failed New Year\u2019s Eve negotiations with the New York City Transit Authority (TA) over an expiring collective bargaining agreement covering subway and bus operators, more than 33,000 members of the Transport Workers Union (TWU) and 2,000 members of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) went on strike, shutting down the city\u2019s transit system, and beginning a historic 12-day strike on the first day of the New Year. It was the unions\u2019 first city-wide action. Their demands included a 30 percent raise; a 32-hour, four-day workweek; retirement at half pay after 25 years; and improved pension benefits.\n\nComplicating matters was the change from Democratic mayor Robert Wagner to incoming Republican mayor John Lindsay beginning New Year\u2019s Day. Promptly after his inauguration, Mayor Lindsay took legal action calling the strike \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nThe State Supreme Court Justice George Tilzer issued an injunction to stop the strike from taking place, but TWU founding president Michael Quill broke the injunction, ignored mayor Lindsay's command to end the strike. He was arrested along with eight other union leaders. Quill had a heart attack in jail and turned negotiations over to TWU Secretary- Treasurer Doug MacMahon, but he continued to assist with negotiations from an oxygen tent.\n\nThe strike brought the city to a standstill for the millions who relied on the transit system. Many commuters ended up walking over the Brooklyn Bridge to get into Manhattan. Those too far to walk had to leave their homes by 4 a.m. and brave the congested streets. Some schoolchildren missed up to nine days of school, while others were diverted to the closest school. The workers had the upper hand.\n\nNearly two weeks into the strike, the parties entered mediation and came to an agreement based on the mediator\u2019s suggested settlement, which included a 15 percent wage increase, an additional paid holiday, increased pension benefits, and other improved benefits for the union\u2019s workers. The striking transit workers were given amnesty for participating in the so-called \u201cillegal strike\u201d and kept their jobs with the city.\n\nThe agreement, announced on Jan. 13, ended the strike. Both unions returned to work, and the city\u2019s transit operations resumed within hours. Quill died three days after the TWU reached the agreement. \u25a0",

The company claims the \u201cElectric Launch System for Unmanned Aircraft\u201d is part of a broader effort to support the launching of drones in constrained environments both on land and at sea.\n\n\u201cAs you know, with the proliferation of RPAS [Remotely Piloted Aircraft System] worldwide, whether on land or sea, we\u2019ve been asked to look at the launch of RPAS in very small footprint from Navy vessels. It\u2019s been looked at primarily Europe right now. Possibly over in the Indo-Pacific area too,\u201d Gary Hopper, Vice President of Strategic Development at General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems told Naval News.\n\nConcepts for the installation of the Electric Launch System for Unmanned Aircraft on the Daring-class destroyer, Expeditionary Sea Base Ship, Izumo-class helicopter destroyer and Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. Courtesy of General Atomics\n\nThe company stressed that the concepts shown on the show floor of the annual Surface Navy Association symposium were \u201centirely different\u201d from the company\u2019s Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System seen on the Ford-class aircraft carriers and the future French Navy PANG. According to Hopper, the concept prioritizes the launching of unmanned systems compared to the fighter and support aircraft launched from carriers. Compared to EMALS, the drone launcher requires a minimal footprint on a vessel. Company graphics claim that the launcher only needs a 4 foot by 2 foot installation area.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the same redundancy, same requirements you have for manned flight. So it\u2019s a lot simpler system that (can be) put on, possibly some the British carriers or other vessels,\u201d said Hopper.\n\nInstallation proposals on the Royal Navy\u2019s Queen Elizabeth-class and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\u2019s Izumo-class carriers were also displayed. In addition, a rendering for a ground-based system in support of expeditionary missions was highlighted. Electromagnetic Systems also confirmed that Aeronautical Systems, a sister company, is examining this concept for the deployment of its Collaborative Combat Aircraft from land-based airfields.\n\nHopper noted that further designs were being examined by the company for other countries within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and characterized the broader effort as an initiative by the alliance to get unmanned aerial systems onto vessels beyond aircraft carriers.\n\n\u201cThere are other we\u2019re looking at some other examples, other NATO countries. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a NATO initiative to look at putting it on aircraft. So we use that particular vessel, but there are other vessels out there, again, similar, similar size. In fact, we\u2019re talking about takeoff distance of 22 meters, not very long at all,\u201d said Hopper.\n\nGeneral Atomics Mojave drone taking off from ROKS Dokdo (ROK Navy Photo)\n\nGeneral Atomics performed tests of its drones of HMS Prince of Wales (R09) and ROKS Dokdo (LPH-6111) in 2023 and 2024 respectively. The company told Naval News that it is working on a \u201cvery unique recovery plan\u201d given the lack of space on surface combatants and support vessels to receive the drones.",

These are all great things to have if you enjoy cooking.\n\nWhile the decision of which fuel to cook with might be out of your hands, you still have plenty of options when it comes to the model. There are dozens of options to choose from, but lucky for you, we've tested enough electric ranges to make some strong recommendations.

It passed every test we threw at it with flying colors, from boiling water to baking pizza. Its ability to multitask sets it apart from other ranges. In particular, we loved having the option to bake two dishes at different temperatures simultaneously and fit at least four pots on the cooktop at once. This range is chock-full of features, including Frozen Bake, Rapid Preheat, and Sabbath Mode. You won\u2019t find an air fry setting, but True Convection mode will produce the same deliciously crispy results. It's available in stainless steel, black, and white finishes, so it\u2019s designed to match most kitchens. Regardless of the finish, we like the look of this range in particular because of the ultra-sleek smooth cooktop. The only small downside we could find to this range was the uneven doneness of cookies when we tested True Convection mode in the bottom oven.

You wouldn't know that this electric range is a value pick just by looking at it, though. It boasts a sleek, stainless steel design and intuitive control panel that offers several oven modes (including true convection). We were also impressed by the solid construction of this range, made evident by our thermal imaging's showing of effective insulation. Perhaps most importantly, this range bakes like a dream. We measured that set oven temperatures were precise and accurate with very minimal fluctuations, especially in true convection mode. And there was even heating throughout the oven's interior. The burners struggled slightly with maintaining low temperatures for simmering\u2014an issue that's common with most electric ranges\u2014but they heat quickly and can reach effectively high temperatures for searing.

This range has five burners, the front two of which have multiple rings, and can reach temperatures well over 800\u00b0F. The oven gets hot enough to cook a pizza (at 500\u00b0F), and makes baking evenly baked cookies look like a cakewalk.

This range struggled to bake cookies evenly, cook pizza all the way through, and perfectly brown pork. Read our full Haier QSS740BNTS Electric Range review Pros Attractive design\n\nIncludes built-in meat probe\n\nRemote preheat Cons Uneven baking\n\nCan\u2019t use many features without app\n\nGE JS645SLSS The GE JS645SLSS Electric Range is easy on the eyes and it faired well on most of our tests, baking cookies particularly evenly. But this 30-inch slide-in range is missing convection, so you can forget about achieving air fryer-like crispiness. This function is super basic and there\u2019s really no reason an oven shouldn\u2019t have it, especially one that\u2019s over $1,000. Read our full GE JS645SLSS Electric Range review Pros Sleek design\n\nEven baking Cons No convection\n\nSlow boil times\n\nHow We Test Electric Ranges\n\nNot only do we perform repeatable, lab-based tests on ovens, ranges, and cooktops, but we also do real-world evaluations (think: cookie baking and the like). That means we can tell you which products will perform the best, will give you the most bang for your buck, or have the sleekest looks.\n\nBurner Temperature\n\nFor products with burners, we measure the maximum and minimum temperature of each burner to help consumers identify which burners are ideal for simmering soup, and which burner can get hot enough to properly sear a steak. We conduct these tests by using a thermocouple to measure the temperatures of empty stainless steel bases.\n\nA range or cooktop with multiple burners that can reach very high and/or very low temperatures will score well. If burners cannot reach very high or low temperatures\u2014or if only one burner can do each task\u2014scores will be lower.\n\nTime To Boil Water\n\nOne of the most common tasks for a range or cooktop is to boil a pot of water. For each burner, we take an appropriately sized pot, and fill it up halfway with distilled water. Then, we position a thermometer horizontally in the middle of the pot, and vertically in the middle of the water column. We monitor the thermocouple and record the time it takes for the temperature of the water to reach 200\u00b0F.\n\nBecause the water volume is different for varying burner sizes, we score the boil test on the rate of boiling. Faster water boiling will result in higher scores, while slower water boiling will result in lower scores.\n\nTime To Preheat\n\nUsing a stopwatch, we measure how long it takes for the electric oven to achieve a preheating temperature of 350\u00b0F. We stop the clock when the oven\u2019s preheat indicator beeps.\n\nBecause no one wants to wait around forever, shorter preheating times result in higher scores, while longer preheating times result in lower scores.\n\nHow Evenly The Oven Bakes\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Julia MacDougall We bake cookies in both standard bake and convection mode (if available) to see how evenly the oven can bake the cookies.\n\nOne happy side effect of testing ovens is that there are always extra cookies lying around. In addition to being delicious, cookies double as a cooking/baking proxy for other thin food items, such as brownies or vegetables.\n\nWe place 12 Pillsbury ready-to-bake sugar cookie chunks on an ungreased cookie sheet in a grid formation. After preheating the oven to 350\u00b0F for 15 minutes, we place the cookie sheet in the oven on the rack recommended by the manufacturer (or, if there is no recommendation, the middle rack) to bake for 15 minutes. We remove the cookies from the oven, and allow them to cool for 2 minutes.\n\nAfter looking the cookies over, we determine how evenly baked they are, both within a single baking sheet (regular baking mode and second oven baking mode) and between multiple baking sheets (convection bake mode). Because convection is generally a more efficient way of cooking or baking something, it is important that the multiple food items on different racks be cooked or baked to the same degree.\n\nFor all of our cookie tests, the more evenly baked the cookies are, the higher the score will be. If the product has a second oven and/or convection cooking capabilities, then the cookie scores for those tests and the main oven test are weighted and combined to arrive at a final cookie score. This way, products with just a single, conventional oven are not penalized for their lack of a second oven or convection capabilities.\n\nWe also use another thermocouple thermometer to subjectively measure how well the oven maintains a certain set temperature over the course of an hour, accounting for any dips in temperature along the way.\n\nHeat Insulation\n\nA tell-tale sign of a range with solid construction is maintaining heat insulation. We use thermal image testing to monitor how well a range is able to hold heat without letting it escape.\n\nThermal imaging can also help us determine whether a range is dangerously heating control elements\u2014like rear burner dials\u2014so that we can account for that when writing a review.\n\nOverall Experience\n\nWhile we go to great lengths to test the cooking/baking abilities of these cooking appliances, we also incorporate more subjective information into our overall assessment.\n\nFor example, how easily can the cooktop surface accommodate multiple pots and pans? Is there a spacious storage drawer? How easy is it to understand the control panel? We answer all of these questions and more to determine if there are any major drawbacks to the product that might not make it a good fit for most households.\n\nWhat You Should Know Before Buying An Electric Range\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between Convection And True Convection?\n\nTrue Convection is an oven setting that includes installing an extra heating element and a fan in the oven. By adding an additional heating unit and fan that circulates the hot air, True Convection is great for ensuring that cookies or cakes baked on different racks will bake through at the same rate, rather than the cookies closest to the bottom heat source cooking faster than those on the rack higher up.\n\nIf you don't see mention of \"True Convection\" or \"European Convection\", but do see the word \"convection\" in a range's specs, it means that the unit lacks an additional heating element, but does have a fan to circulate the hot air. While you don't get the full baking and cooking effect that you would with True Convection, the added heat circulation can cook or bake food more evenly than it would without a fan.\n\nThere are also ranges out there that do not offer convection options at all; these ovens aren't bad, it will just take more time to cook and bake food all the way through. If you're a frequent baker or cook, convection can be a great time saver, but your dinners won't suffer unduly without it.\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between Slide-in And Freestanding Ranges?\n\nIn a nutshell, slide-in ranges are meant to sit flush with your countertops, while freestanding ranges are meant to sit on top of any surface.\n\nWhile slotting in and sitting on top of your countertop may seem similar, the main differences between the two involve finish and ease of cleaning. Because freestanding ranges are visible from all angles, they have more finished sides; slide-in ranges are meant to have their sides hidden by the cabinetry, so the finish typically isn't as pretty on the sides.\n\nAdditionally, because slide-in ranges sit flush with your countertop, they're a bit easier to clean because they do not have a large lip around the edge. Freestanding ranges often have larger lips around the edge of the cooktop to corral any crumbs that would otherwise decorate your floor. Freestanding ranges also typically have a back-mounted control panel for the same reason.\n\nWhile slide-in ranges will do fine in a freestanding arrangement, the reverse is less true. If your current cooking setup has the range sitting in a cabinet or countertop cutout, we recommend replacing that range with another slide-in range. Conversely, if your range stands alone in your kitchen, we'd recommend replacing it with another freestanding range to cut down on food debris spilling everywhere.\n\nShould I Get A Front-mounted Control Panel Or Back-mounted Control Panel?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, most freestanding ranges have back-mounted controls, but some slide-in ranges do as well.\n\nBoth arrangements have pros and cons; on the one hand, having back-mounted controls means you may have to reach over hot food to adjust the oven temperature, the controls are also far enough away that you would have difficulty hitting something on the control panel by accident.\n\nOn the other hand, front-mounted controls are easier to reach, but that convenience can turn against you if you brush up against a knob accidentally. Consider the ergonomics of using the range when it comes to picking a front- or back-mounted control panel.\n\nHow Many Burners Do I Need?\n\nDepending on how much time you spend in the kitchen, it might be worth it to investigate in some extra options for your range. When it comes to the cooktop, anything above the standard four-burner setup is a bonus. Some ranges can have five, or even six burners; however, the more burners a range has, the more difficult it becomes to fit large pieces of cookware, such as a spaghetti pot and a frying pan, on their respective burners at the same time.\n\nSometimes, those extra burners are specialty burners are designed to accommodate special cookware such as a griddle or a wok; other burners are bridge burners that are meant to keep food warm without continuing to cook it.\n\nAnother possibility is to have a dual-ring burner, or a burner that includes a stronger heat source wrapped around a weaker heat source. That way, on a single burner, you can choose to use just the smaller heat source for lower temperatures, but you can add the stronger heat source if you need higher temperatures.\n\nWhat Oven Features Do I Need?\n\nAs for extra oven features, they can include everything from accessories like special oven racks or a temperature probe to special cooking features.\n\nThat can include the aforementioned convection settings, fast preheat, bread proofing, steam cooking (where you pour water into a reservoir and gently cook something with the resulting steam), air fry mode, and many more.\n\nMore Articles You Might Enjoy",

            "content": "Housatonic Rest of River \u2014 Although a General Electric Company (GE) representative outlined its plan for Reach 6 of the Housatonic Rest of River remediation that includes Woods and Valley Mill ponds, some details of that facet of the decade-plus project will need to wait until the reach\u2019s final plan is released next year.\n\n\u201cThis is a conceptual design, so this is kind of a proof of concept, looking at what could be done, and we\u2019ll get into more detail as we get to the final design,\u201d GE Senior Project Manager Kevin Mooney said at a January 15 public meeting on Reach 6 held via Zoom.\n\nPublic input on the Reach 6 plan ends February 3 and can be submitted to R1Housatonic@epa.gov.\n\nFollowing decades of contaminating the Housatonic River from its Pittsfield plant with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or toxic chemicals that don\u2019t break down, GE executed a 2020 agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and representatives from five affected Berkshire County towns outlining the remediation of the waterway. That plan provided for the most-concentrated PCB materials to be sent to a landfill out of the area while the least-concentrated materials would be deposited in an Upland Disposal Facility (UDF), or toxic-waste landfill, in Lee.\n\nMooney\u2019s hour-long presentation offered highlights of the project that will remove more than 490,000 cubic yards (cy) of sediment, with much of that dredged material expected to be transported using hydraulic pumping to the UDF in Lee. About 8,610 cy of higher PCB-concentrated materials are slated to be sent by rail to an off-site landfill.\n\nMooney\u2019s slide presentation can be found here.\n\nDefining Reach 6\n\nReach 6 includes Woods Pond at 53.6 acres, the outlet channel of Woods Pond at about 3.7 acres, and five floodplain areas that incorporate two vernal pools. An additional area, \u201cHeadwaters,\u201d is a transition zone of 12.6 acres, and its remediation will be performed with Reach 5C.\n\nValley Mill Pond\u2019s 4.6 acres is also in Reach 6, on the eastern side of the river and south of Woods Pond Dam. Its remediation will use hydraulic pumping within the same system as Woods Pond.\n\nAccording to Mooney, in most of Reach 6\u2019s floodplain, PCB levels are below the EPA standards for acceptability and soil remediation is required in two areas of about 400 square feet. The two vernal pools in the area don\u2019t require remediation, he said, as they are below the EPA limits for vernal pools.\n\nAll sediment removed from Woods Pond will be taken to the UDF as sampling has shown the \u201caverage\u201d PCB concentration to be at about 3.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) below the 100 mg/kg standard set by the EPA. For Valley Mill Pond, historical sampling from 2001 and supplemented with additional data from 2023 shows some materials will need to be transported to an off-site facility. Floodplain soil will be evaluated to determine the average PCB concentration, with the dredged material taken to the UDF if it is at a concentration level of less than or equal to 50 mg/kg and off site if greater than that value.\n\nRemediation efforts in Reach 6 will take about three to four years to complete and are expected to be performed in parallel with upstream remediation in Reach 5A. Mooney said the capping of Reach 6 will be delayed about five years after that project finishes to allow for the upstream remediation in Reaches 5A, 5B, and 5C to finish.\n\nPlan details\n\nAccording to Mooney, sediment in Woods Pond will be hydraulically dredged up to six feet below the Woods Pond Dam crest, with possibly an extra foot to account for a cap that will serve to protect erosion on site and prevent any remaining contamination. The process involves dislodging the sediment and sucking the matter along with the river water into a pipeline using a pump. This creates a slurry that, once it reaches the UDF, will be dewatered and treated at the UDF\u2019s on-site water-treatment facility before it is discharged back into the Housatonic.\n\nHowever, detailed information for Valley Mill Pond\u2019s remediation will come later once PCB sampling in the area and surveys have been conducted, actions that will \u201cdetermine the type and extent of remediation necessary.\u201d\n\nMooney said GE sampled the sediment and floodplain soil in Woods Pond and Reach 6 in the fall of 2023, compiling that information into a report submitted to the EPA on October 31. Those investigations showed that about 11 endangered species have habitat in the area, he said, with details about mitigation efforts impacting those species reserved for Reach 6\u2019s final design.\n\nA facility to assist in the dredging and for handling materials will be constructed on the southern shore of Woods Pond, with a bulkhead and boat launch for pond access. A rail spur and loading/unloading area will be built just west of Woods Pond.\n\nThe final design of Reach 6 will include standards for the area\u2019s air quality, noise, odor, and lighting, with air-quality and noise monitoring during the project used to determine if those standards have been violated.\n\nRemoval and transport by the numbers\n\nMooney illustrated how much area is estimated to be remediated within Reach 6. The total amount of area to be removed from Reach 6 is estimated to be 493,320 cy, or about 61.5 acres, with most of that coming from Woods Pond. All materials to be removed from Woods Pond, about 461,000 cy or 53.6 acres, will be disposed of at the UDF, as well as the Outlet Channel sediment\u2019s 20,000 cy.\n\nOut of the 12,300 cy, or 4.2 acres, of sediment anticipated to be removed from Valley Mill Pond, about 3,700 cy of it will be taken to the UDF, and the majority, or 8,600 cy, will be disposed of out of the area.\n\nAt an estimate of only 20 cy, not much of Reach 6\u2019s floodplain soil will be removed, with that disposal split evenly between the UDF and an out-of-area landfill.\n\nPush for shorter cleanup period\n\nLed by Dr. Charles Kenny, chair of the Tri-Town Health Department representing Lee, Lenox, and Stockbridge, meeting attendees repeatedly pushed EPA officials and Mooney for ways to shorten the timeline for Reach 6\u2019s remediation, including the reason behind the five-year gap between completing that Reach and capping Woods Pond. \u201cI want to address the issue of how long this is taking,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cThe total project is quite long, and so I\u2019m looking at how we might reasonably speed it up.\u201d\n\nUpon questioning by Kenny, Mooney responded that, per this conceptual design, the estimated time for the project anticipates two hydraulic dredges to be used simultaneously at Woods Pond, five days a week, for 10 to 12 hours daily. Kenny pointed out that the project could be hastened if officials doubled the number of dredges to four to be used at one time, possibly cutting the three-year length of the project to a year and a half.\n\nMooney said that all the material from Woods Pond must be pumped to the UDF, limiting how much material could be processed at the landfill. Kenny inquired about whether the result would differ should an auxiliary dewatering and water-treatment plant be placed elsewhere, such as at Columbia Mill, so material from another reach, Reach 5C, could be processed at the same time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going to be a viable idea that we then expand the area down to Columbia Mill,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cIt\u2019s far away from the operations center, and there potentially could be a limit of space and infrastructure and also contractor capabilities if this were done.\u201d\n\nWoods Pond \u201chas by far the highest volume, and it\u2019s relatively the easiest to pump out,\u201d according to EPA Project Manager Dean Tagliaferro. \u201cTo get the mass removal out as quickly as possible, we went back and forth as to where GE could have two crews and thought, \u20185A and Woods Pond,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the two largest areas of volume\u2026 we went where the largest volume was to get as much out of the river as possible. Ideally, you could work all eight reaches at the same time but, as [Mooney] said, I think there\u2019s a feasibility limit there.\u201d\n\nSince the material removal will occur prior to completing the removal and backfilling of upstream reaches, Tagliaferro said Woods Pond can\u2019t be capped until all upstream reaches are capped. Otherwise, the clean cap would risk being contaminated again, he said.\n\nPittsfield\u2019s Kaitlyn Pierce advocated that research shows no level of PCB exposure is safe, while the plan allows for leaving lower levels of PCB concentration in the waterway and floodplain. Tagliaferro responded that the EPA established its cleanup process following 15 years of research into a human-health assessment standard that evaluates the risk at such sites. \u201cVery few chemicals have zero risk at any concentration, so EPA\u2019s regulations and guidelines have what they have determined, and others have determined\u2026 [to be] acceptable risk ranges,\u201d he said. Those ranges apply to every Superfund site and are based on factors such as how often people are in contact with the contaminant and lifetime cancer risks, eventually becoming the performance standards GE must meet in this project, Tagliaferro said.\n\n\u201cFar and away the highest risk to human health is consumption of fish,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, that is and will be our main goal for the remediation.\u201d\n\nEPA Remedial Project Manager Josh Fontaine added that the site will continue to be monitored after the remediation has ended, ensuring samples are within that risk range and the cap is performing.\n\nCharles Cianfarini, interim director of the Citizens for PCB Removal, inquired about the rate of water flow during the remediation process, voicing concern about the river running dry as the waterway is dredged. EPA Remedial Project Manager Josh Fontaine answered that the river water will be replaced once it is treated at the UDF treatment facility, backfilling the removal, and Mooney replied that the rate at which the water is removed is lower than the rate of flow as the water is replaced.\n\nAfter the final Reach 6 plan is released, EPA and GE officials said their representatives will hold another public meeting on that proposal.",

            "content": "Investors in General Electric Co (Symbol: GE) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2026 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 518 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the GE options chain for the new June 2026 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $156.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of GE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $180.87/share today.\n\nBecause the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.57% return on the cash commitment, or 7.45% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for General Electric Co, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $190.00 strike price has a current bid of $24.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of GE stock at the current price level of $180.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $190.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 18.84% if the stock gets called away at the June 2026 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GE shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for General Electric Co, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GE's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $190.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $190.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 42%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.79% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.72% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $180.87) to be 31%.

            "content": "Despite this success, the market is becoming more competitive, with local brands like BYD taking a larger slice of the pie. China EV companies, NIO, XPeng and Li Auto, registered more than 30% year-over-year growth in deliveries for full-year 2024.\n\nTesla did manage to hold onto its lead in full-year deliveries for 2024. However, the company is facing increased competition in China. Per China EV DataTracker, TSLA\u2019s Model Y was the top-selling car in the country in 2024, selling more than 480,000 units. Tesla recently unveiled a redesigned Model Y in China, which features a refreshed exterior and enhanced interior, with an intent to regain market share from competitors like Xiaomi. The model received 50,000 preorders on its first day.\n\nThe country's EV market saw a 40% increase in sales, with 11 million units sold. This success can be attributed to various factors, including government incentives, trade-in programs, and impressive product offerings from domestic manufacturers like BYD Co Ltd. . BYD's ability to offer more than 40 models helped boost sales in China. BYD is now a key player in the global EV race.\n\nAccording to Rho Motion, global electrified vehicle sales surged 25%, reaching a total of 17.1 million units. While the growth rate slowed compared to the 35% year-over-year increase in 2023, the numbers are still impressive. And this was despite Tesla \u2014 the world\u2019s largest EV maker\u2014 witnessing its first ever annual decline in sales volumes.\n\nData shows that global sales of EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles hit a record high in 2024, thanks to booming growth in China and other regions, which offset the weaker performance in Europe.\n\nLast year, there was a lot of talk about declining electric vehicle (EV) sales, lower-than-expected adoption and various challenges in the e-mobility market. Many manufacturers even scaled back their ambitious electrification plans. But looking back, things weren't as bad as predicted. In fact, it turned out pretty well!\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 16, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla TSLA, BYD Co Ltd. BYDDY, General Motors GM and Ford F.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEurope EV Sales: A Mixed Bag\n\nEurope, on the other hand, faced a more mixed situation in 2024. While overall EV sales across the continent exceeded 3 million units, the region experienced a 3% decline compared to 2023. A major contributing factor to this downturn was the removal of subsidies in key markets, especially Germany. Germany\u2019s government had been a strong supporter of EV adoption, but as incentives were scaled back, sales took a hit.\n\nHowever, Europe was not without its success stories. The United Kingdom saw a nearly 20% increase in EV sales, thanks in part to the introduction of the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate. This policy required automakers to push low-emission vehicles, leading to higher sales in the UK. Norway, too, continued to be a shining example, with over 90% of passenger vehicle sales in the country being EVs by the end of the year.\n\nNorth America Witnesses Steady Growth\n\nIn North America, the EV market experienced a solid 9% growth in 2024, with the United States and Canada collectively selling 1.8 million EVs. Despite challenges such as Tesla's first-ever annual decline in sales, it continued to dominate with a 50% market share. Consumer subsidies and investments in EV infrastructure played a key role in driving this growth. U.S. EV sales in 2024 totaled 1.3 million units, up more than 7% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLegacy automakers like General Motors and Ford secured second and third spots, respectively, in U.S. BEV sales in 2024.For the full year, GM\u2019s EV sales reached approximately 114,000, representing a 50% increase from 2023. Ford sold 97,865 all-electric vehicles in 2024, a 35% year-over-year increase.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2025\n\nIn the United States, one in four vehicles sold in 2025 is projected to be electrified, with pure electric cars accounting for about 10% of total sales, per Cox Automotive. This growth will be fueled by increased consumer interest, the widening variety of EV models, and growing awareness of sustainability. However, political and policy shifts could introduce uncertainty. With Donald Trump set to resume presidency next week, there are concerns about potential rollbacks of EV tax credits and emissions standards. If these supportive policies are reversed, it could dampen the EV market's momentum in the country.\n\nIn China, sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids are expected to rise by around 24% in 2025, per China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. China's commitment to clean energy transitions and government support for e-mobility will continue to solidify its position as a global leader in EV adoption.\n\nEurope\u2019s EV market is set to bounce back in 2025. EV volumes are predicted to return to growth as the region overcomes its recent stagnation. Key to this recovery is the EU\u2019s \"Fit for 55\" initiative, which continues to support the shift to sustainable mobility. With this policy framework in place, Europe is well-positioned to accelerate EV adoption.\n\nGas-Powered Cars Losing Popularity\n\nOne important trend often overlooked is the long-term decline of gasoline-powered car sales. Global sales of gas cars peaked in 2017 and have been steadily declining ever since. In the United States, sales of internal combustion engine vehicles are expected to drop to 75% of total volume, the lowest level on record, in 2025. So, compared with the ongoing decline in gas car sales, the growth in EV sales looks even more impressive.\n\nLast Word\n\nAs consumer demand continues to grow and government incentives play a crucial role, the global EV market in 2025 is expected to stay strong. But the market's success will depend on continued support from policymakers and the ability of automakers to meet the growing demand for EVs. With gasoline car sales in long-term decline, the transition to EVs is not just a trend\u2014it\u2019s becoming the new norm.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

They contended that such a mandate would disrupt the nation's logistics and transportation industries. California's Advanced Clean Fleets regulation sought to impose an electric truck mandate on fleet owners, operators, and manufacturers, including those trucking companies that operate in California even for a single day per year.\n\n\"California\u2019s mandate is an absurd overreach that would have inflicted serious harm to our fossil fuels industry,\" Drummond said. \"This victory helps keep our supply line in order across the United States. I am grateful for this resolution, and I will continue to fight against the radical climate agenda of the far left.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the EPA granted several requests by California but did not act on the Advanced Clean Fleets request. California withdrew its request on Monday, and the EPA closed the file on Tuesday.\n\nThe attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the comment letter.",

            "content": "While commercial aircraft manufacturing is dominated by two big players, Boeing and Airbus, the engine industry has a similarly small playing field. Four big companies make up 99% of the global aero engine market \u2013 Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney, CFM International and General Electric.\n\nOf the four, CFM holds the largest market share, closely followed by Pratt & Whitney. General Electric and Rolls-Royce have smaller shares overall, but dominate in the widebody market.\n\nWe take a look at these behemoths of aerospace engines and the powerplants they produce.\n\nCFM International\n\nCFM International is a joint venture between General Electric (GE) Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines. The company name is derived from the designations of the engines produced by the parent companies \u2013 the CF series from GE and the M series from Safran (formerly Snecma).\n\nFounded in 1974, the partnership was to support and build the CFM56 engine, a high-bypass turbofan engine with low noise, reduced maintenance, and minimal fuel consumption. The engine first ran in 1974, but by 1979, CFM had not received a single order and was days away from being dissolved.\n\nCFM56 Photo CFM\n\nRescue arrived in the form of Delta, United, and Flying Tigers, who chose the CFM56 to re-engine their Douglas DC-8s under the Super 70 program. The same engine was selected to re-engine the Boeing 737 Classic and then to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF.\n\nDespite its rocky start, the CFM56 has become the world\u2019s best-selling jet engine, with more than 33,000 units delivered to more than 600 operators worldwide. Since launch, the engine has powered over a billion flight hours.\n\nTo succeed the CFM56, the company began working on the LEAP (Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion) engine in 2008. The engine took its first run in 2013, and its first flight in 2014 using GE\u2019s 747-400 flying testbed.\n\nCFM LEAP\n\nThe LEAP has become the only engine option for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX family, and one of two options for the Airbus A320neo family. It also powers the world\u2019s newest clean-sheet narrowbody, the COMAC C919.\n\nAccording to the CAPA Fleet Database, 72% of the world\u2019s active narrowbody fleet is powered by CFM engines. Its next nearest competitor, Pratt & Whitney, powers just 25% of the active narrowbody fleet.\n\nPratt & Whitney\n\nPratt & Whitney (P&W) is a storied institution with a century-long legacy in aviation. From the early successes of the Wasp and Hornet engines to the introduction of the industry\u2019s first Geared Turbofan powerplant, this historic US company continues to set the bar in propulsion technology.\n\nToday, at least 13,000 Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines have been installed, and across its product range, more than 85,000 engines are in service. P&W products can be found on everything from widebody commercial aircraft to fighter jets and even cruise missiles.\n\nPratt & Whitney military engine Photo Pratt & Whitney\n\nOne of the most groundbreaking developments from P&W is its GTF engine, the industry\u2019s only commercially available modern geared propulsion system. Also known as the PW1000G, it\u2019s the primary propulsion option for the Embraer E2 and the Airbus A220, and an option for the A320neo family and MC-21.\n\nPratt & Whitney claims that the GTF offers fuel and CO2 savings of up to 20% and noise reduction of up to 75%. It\u2019s in service on more than 2,000 aircraft across 80-plus operators and has an outstanding order book of 11,000 more engines.\n\nPratt & Whitney GTF engine Photo Pratt & Whitney\n\nHowever, problems with the GTF\u2019s reliability have seen P&W launch a widespread inspection campaign, leading to around a third of the active fleet being grounded at any one time. In all, up to 700 PW1100G engines needed to be removed, a task that will take until 2026 to complete. The fallout has seen airlines blaming P&W for lower-than-expected profits and even canceling flights as they struggle with capacity.\n\nP&W has partnered with other companies to develop engines together. Under the International Aero Engines joint venture, it joined with MTU Aero Engines and Japanese Aero Engine Corporation to develop the V2500 turbofan. With GE, it went in 50/50 on the Engine Alliance joint venture to develop the GP7000 for the Airbus A380.\n\nGeneral Electric\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) has a legacy that goes back even further than Pratt & Whitney, dating back to the early 1900s when it was known for its work on steam turbines. The company became a world leader in turbosuperchargers just before World War II and was instrumental in the development of the jet engine through the 1940s. This led to the launch of the TF39 in the 1960s, designed to power the C-5 Galaxy, and a civilian variant, the CF6, which ended up on various airframes including the A330 and Boeing 747.\n\nGE CF6 engine Photo GE\n\nModern-day GE has a solid book of products, most notably being the exclusive engine supplier for the Boeing 777 and the 747-8. It provides one of two engine options for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and is the sole provider for the MQ-25 Stingray, the US Navy\u2019s unmanned refueling aircraft.\n\nOf the equipped in-service fleet, 52% of widebody aircraft fly with GE engines. In terms of backlog, GE engines have been specified for 54% of new widebody orders.\n\nBoeing\u2019s newest aircraft, the 777X, flies exclusively with GE\u2019s GE9X engine, the largest and most powerful commercial aircraft engine ever built. It holds the Guinness World Record for its powerful thrust, measured at 134,300 lbs (597 kN).\n\n777X Flight Test Engine Install_2\n\nAlthough GE has a relatively small market share, it\u2019s important to remember that it is a 50% participant in the CFM International joint venture, alongside Safran.\n\nRolls-Royce\n\nIf Pratt & GE are icons of the US aerospace industry, Rolls-Royce is their European equivalent. Its first aero-engine, the Eagle, was completed in 1915, quickly followed by the Hawk and the Falcon. Around half the aircraft engines used by allies in World War I were made by Rolls-Royce.\n\nBy the 1950s, the Rolls-Royce Dart and Tyne turboprop engines were enabling airlines to cut journey times in their Friendships, Vanguards, and Viscounts. At the same time, the company furthered the jet propulsion work of engineer Frank Whittle, culminating in the Welland, the first jet engine to enter military service.\n\nOver the years, Rolls-Royce has developed many of the engines that have shaped modern aviation as we know it. Its Trent engine series has powered everything from the Airbus A380 to the Boeing 787, and its Trent XWB is the exclusive powerplant for the Airbus A350. The company even manufactured the engines for Concorde.\n\nRolls-Royce was particularly hard-hit during the pandemic, as revenue from widebody engine maintenance dried up. It shed 7,000 staff out of a workforce of 19,000 and changed CEO, but returned to profitability in 2024. Its engines power 33% of the world\u2019s widebody fleet, and have 46% of the order backlog for widebodies.\n\nRolls-Royce Ultrafan engine Photo Rolls-Rouce\n\nThe company has been testing new engine technology with its UltraFan demonstrator, promising 25% fuel burn improvements on the first generation of Trent engines. Rolls-Royce doesn\u2019t make narrowbody engines at present, but has indicated it may return to the market later, with reports of discussions with Airbus for a \u2018shrink\u2019 of the UltraFan for its next-generation single-aisle aircraft.",

            "content": "Electric cars generally cost more than conventional automobiles. But the pricing gap between the two is closing.\n\nAccording to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for electric cars was $55,614 in January, a 1.4% decrease from the previous year. That compares to gas-powered vehicles at $48,641, or 1.3% higher for gas-powered vehicles year over year. The industry\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) leader, Tesla, had average transaction prices of $55,380, a 4.5% increase from the year earlier.\n\nIn general, electric cars start at $29,280, including destination charges, for the cheapest electric car, the 2025 Nissan Leaf, to upwards of $100,000 for a luxury EV like the 2025 Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV (starts at $106,300, including destination charges).\n\nIn January, new electric vehicle sales volume reached 102,243 units, up nearly 30% year over year. It\u2019s the 10th consecutive month with over 100,000 units sold.\n\nThe average listing price for a used EV decreased about 5% to $37,476 in January from the year earlier. About 39% of the used EVs sold were priced under $25,000.\n\nThe federal government offers qualified buyers electric car incentives of up to $7,500 for select new fully electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. Those looking to lease an EV may find a dealership offering qualified buyers the same tax credit. Buyers looking for used electric cars may qualify for up to a $4,000 credit on specific models. That, too, helps lower the price and close the gap in the pricing of electric vehicles compared with their gas counterparts. However, EV incentives may change under the new administration.\n\nAnother cost savings is that fully electric cars run on electricity and do not need gasoline or regular oil changes and other maintenance that gas cars require. Typically, fuel costs more than electricity, which is another money saver for people who drive electric vehicles.\n\nRELATED: How Much Does It Cost To Charge an Electric Car?",

Neither company has confirmed a precise location, yet the multi-year deal will run through 2033 when the two companies renegotiate their contract.\n\nAnode graphite is the largest component by weight of lithium-ion batteries. It is a critical component due to its significant role in connectivity, performance, and charge capability. Most of the supply chain comes from China, which dominates the graphite market due to its immense natural reserves. However, the country recently constricted exports of vital materials amid trade tension.\n\nVianode\u2019s synthetic anode graphite has a 90% lower carbon dioxide footprint than traditional production methods. In addition, Vianode\u2019s partnership and expansion within the United States will create a more stable, sustainable, localized supply chain for critical EV materials. In addition, it will reduce the United States\u2019 dependency on Chinese components.\n\nThe competition in the electric vehicle sector is intensifying, and the key to success is maintaining stable supply lines. The United States\u2019 volatile relationship with China and tightening of critical supply lines could devastate the EV market. This forged alliance between GM and Vianode will supply the American automaker with a sustainable supply of battery materials, solidifying its position as a leader within the EV space.",

However, the Nordmenn have indicated they will build a plant in America for this purpose.\n\nAs reported by The Detroit News and Reuters, an outfit called Vianode has agreed to supply synthetic graphite for The General\u2019s electric cars starting in the 2027 calendar year. Anode graphite is apparently the largest part of a lithium-ion battery in terms of its weight, so a reliable source is key to cranking out this important EV component. At present, it is suggested that China controls over 90 percent of global graphite supply.\n\nVianode says they are planning to build a plant for this purpose somewhere in North America, despite the company having roots in Norway. There\u2019s every chance in the world such a facility will end up in close physical proximity to existing GM/LG battery production, a decision which would make sense in terms of supply chain and assembly challenges. Logistics are a heckuva thing when assembling something so complex as an electric car.\n\nThe company already has a plant in its home country, with the new North American effort said to possibly add enough synthetic graphite to supply about 1.5 million electric vehicles. Spox for Vianode say they are in talks to supply other automakers in addition to The General. As an aside, it is of no small irony that the GM/LG joint venture handling these matters is called Ultium Cells, a name which is no longer welcome to be spoken in the halls of General Motors .",

(KPLC) - It\u2019s coming up on a year since Brian Zelenak, the former general manager of Beauregard Electric Co-op (BECi), was fired by those who had hired him. Zelenak moved away, but he\u2019s filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court seeking damages for how he was treated.\n\nZelenak was first hired by BECi at a salary of $320,000 because of what was described as his extensive expertise in dealing with co-ops and electric utilities. However, not long after he was hired, BECi\u2019s board of directors fired him.\n\nPrevious coverage:\n\nZelenak\u2019s attorney James Sudduth said Zelenak was looking out for the interests of co-op members and blowing the whistle on violations inside of BECi.\n\nSudduth said Zelenak\u2019s lawsuit focuses on three issues, the first of which is whistle-blower protection.\n\n\u201cHe was the impetus for getting that information out there to the public. As soon as he did that, they took steps to force him out,\u201d Sudduth said.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges a breach of contract for firing without a valid reason.\n\n\u201cWhen he was fired, he filed for unemployment benefits in Wisconsin. Wisconsin already found there was no cause to fire him and so he\u2019s receiving unemployment benefits,\u201d Sudduth said.\n\nThe third and final issue is alleged defamation.\n\n\u201cWhen you start using false information to incite the population, to fire people up over false information, especially when it\u2019s targeted to one individual. In this case, it caused his career harm, but it also caused reputational harm,\u201d Sudduth said.\n\nSudduth said Zelenak wants to get justice for the co-op members.\n\nBECi\u2019s attorney Shayna Sonnier, said they have not yet received the lawsuit. She said the co-op and directors being sued are looking forward to the legal process and are excited about telling their side of the story in court. She said no one will be interviewed on camera.\n\nCopyright 2025 KPLC. All rights reserved.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nGeneral Motors is turning to artificial intelligence and machine learning to find the optimal locations to install new electric vehicle chargers to best serve drivers, the company announced in a Jan. 8 blog post.\n\nAs part of the project, data scientists at GM are using predictive analytics and geospatial algorithms to evaluate EV traffic patterns in the U.S. to determine where additional EV chargers might be needed.\n\nThe work is supporting GM\u2019s collaboration with public charging infrastructure operator EVgo to build 2,850 DC public charging stalls in major metropolitan areas across the U.S., including 400 flagship destinations featuring high-power 350 kw chargers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAlthough GM\u2019s EV sales reached an all-time high in 2024, the company says uncertainty about how to find charging stations remains a hurdle for many prospective customers. It\u2019s one of the reasons the automaker is collaborating with industry partners EVgo, Pilot Flying J travel centers and ChargePoint to build hundreds of new public charging stalls.\n\nPartnering with Pilot and Flying J contributes to GM\u2019s goal of helping EV owners find chargers faster along major highways where the travel centers operate. Using AI will aid GM in determining optimal locations to best serve EV drivers.\n\nGM\u2019s data scientists are approaching site selection as a \u201cmathematical optimization problem.\u201d First, detailed maps are created to illustrate the AI-powered model\u2019s decision-making process. Then the model\u2019s recommendations are combined with expert insights to finalize the optimal charger placement. Once the data analysis is complete, the company collaborates with Pilot Flying J and EVgo to install the chargers.\n\nIn addition to offering more convenient charging locations, GM is also working to improve the overall charging experience as part of its collaboration with EVgo.\n\nFuture GM charging sites will feature pull-through layouts for easier maneuvering. Many of the flagship locations, which will be co-branded by EVgo and the automaker\u2019s subsidiary GM Energy, will also have all-weather canopies and bright lighting, and be located near amenities such as shopping, dining and coffee shops that drivers can visit while their EVs recharge.\n\nGM is also one of seven OEMs partners in EV charging joint venture Ionna. The joint venture plans to install 30,000 high-powered chargers in North America that the EV customers of each automaker can use.",

            "content": "When a company is spinning off part of its business to shareholders, what's the best move to make? Do you keep stocks in the parent company, in the spin-off, or both?\n\nThe question comes up a lot. Between 2021 and 2023, there were 677 spin-offs of public companies, including major brands like Kellogg and General Electric. However, these deals don't always create new value. Read on to find out what to do when companies split.\n\nKey Takeaways A spin-off is when a company splits into two publicly-traded companies.\n\nDuring a spin-off, stockholders in the original company receive shares of both successor companies.\n\nMost studies suggest that spin-offs outperform over time.\n\nIn the short run, however, they tend to be volatile.\n\nLook at the new stock's fundamentals and management before choosing the best investment.\n\nThe Spin on Spin-offs\n\nIn a pure spin-off, a company distributes 100% of its ownership interest in a unit as a stock dividend to existing shareholders. It's a tax-free method of divestiture that usually helps both the parent and unit achieve better results as separate and more highly-valued entities.\n\nConventional wisdom, as well as historical evidence, suggests that spin-offs and parents both out-perform the market, with the edge going to spin-offs. A commonly cited study in The Journal of Financial Economics found \"significantly positive\" returns for both spin-offs and their parent companies over the three years after separation when compared to the market as a whole.\n\nHowever, it's less clear whether these benefits are due to improved performance by spun-off businesses, or due to other market actors. Spin-offs can be attractive targets for acquisition by other companies, which can raise the stock price prior to a takeover. The same study in the Journal of Financial Economics found that spin-offs and their parents have \"an unusually high level of takeover activity\" and attributed the excess performance to firms involved in takeovers.\n\nA spin-off is different from an acquisition, when one company buys a part of another company's business. However, many spin-offs end in acquisition by another company.\n\nA Second View\n\nIt's also not clear that the expectations of future profits continue to hold out in contemporary markets. Some studies are decidedly mixed on the issue of whether spin-offs provide any long-term advantage.\n\nResearch by the Boyar Value Group found that over the ten years from 2010 to 2020, stock spin-offs underperformed the S&P 500 by about 2.7%. According to the researchers, this may be partially due to a changing market for spin-offs: Companies are under more pressure from their shareholders, and they are more willing to spin-off underperforming divisions as separate companies rather than invest in these assets.\n\n\n\nWhat Keeps Spin-Offs Turning\n\nSpin-offs may perform well for a few reasons. Management teams at the spin-offs have greater incentive to produce, due to their generous stock options awards and stock holdings. They also have greater freedom to start new ventures, rationalize operations, and trim overhead. Meanwhile, management teams at parent companies can focus more on core businesses.\n\nFurther, spin-offs can also be attractive to speculators seeking to benefit from the split. This can have a self-fulfilling effect if a large number of investors buy stock in the parent company before the division takes effect. Stock valuations for both companies may also benefit from investors who prefer focused and pure-play companies.\n\nA 2022 study of 350 spin-offs by the Harvard Business Review found that about half of spin-offs failed to create any new shareholder value, and 25% actually lost shareholder value. However, those that performed well did so exceptionally: the top-performing quartile of separations increased their combined market capitalization by about 75% within two years of separation.\n\nThis may be because a successful spin-off is difficult to execute. Many companies \"doom their separations from the start,\" according to the authors, because they \"assume the mere act of spinning off a business is sufficient to achieve a higher multiple, and they define success shortsightedly as getting to day one as fast as possible.\"\n\nIn contrast, successful spin-offs have well-defined separation and transition plans, even before the change is announced. \"In our study, we found that the existence of a clear and robust separation thesis was the single-biggest difference between top-quartile and bottom-quartile separations,\" they wrote.\n\nWhy Spin-Offs Are More Volatile\n\nStill, spin-off stocks come with a couple of caveats. First, they are more volatile. With their smaller capitalization and financial capacities, they tend to be higher beta stocks that underperform in weak markets and outperform in strong markets. As such, spin-off stocks may be better to own during a bull market than during a bear.\n\nSecond, spin-off stocks often sell-off in the months immediately following the restructuring. Giving shares in a spin-off to existing shareholders is not a particularly efficient way to distribute stock since the shareholders are primarily interested in the parent company. Index funds will also sell the company since the new company is not in the index. Other institutions will sell because the spin-off does not fit with its mandates. It may be too small or have no dividend, or lack the history that the fund uses to make its choices.\n\nIn many cases, the immediate dip in spin-off stock prices is replaced by strength over the next two to three years. So, an investor planning to keep the spin-off may have to wait it out.\n\n677 The number of spin-offs between 2021 and 2023.\n\nEvaluating Individual Spin-offs\n\nWilliam Mitchell, a parter at Strategy Capital and former publisher of Spin-off & Reorg Profiles, says it's essential to \"deduce the reason for separation,\" which can be done by comparing the pro forma balance sheet and income statements of the spin-off and parent. The first thing to check is debt levels and the allocation of other liabilities and troubled assets (such as real estate in 2008).\n\nFor example, a spin-off could end up over-leveraged because the parent may be doing a leveraged recapitalization. In other words, the spin-off is loaded up with debt and the proceeds are being pocketed by the parent.\n\nAnother important factor for Mitchell to study is the return on capital employed, which involves taking the ratio of operating income to net working capital less cash. A spin-off (or parent) with a low reading on this measure may not have much of a strategic advantage in its line of business.\n\nExample of Spin-Offs\n\nOne example of a successful spin-off is Kellanova, formerly known as Kellogg Co. The global cereal and snacking company announced in 2022 that it would split into three independent, publicly-traded companies. The cereals and plant-based foods divisions would be spun off as new companies, while the parent company retained the frozen foods and snacking brands.\n\nUltimately, the company decided not to sell the plant-based foods division, but the spin-off did allow Kellogg to divest itself from the stagnating breakfast cereal and focus on the more profitable snacking brands. The divorce was finalized on Oct. 2, 2023: The North American cereal business began trading as WK Kellogg(KLG) and the larger snacking business was renamed Kellanova (K).\n\nInvestors received one share of WK Kellogg for every four shares they owned of Kellogg's before the split. Both companies saw their shares tumble immediately following the split, although performance improved over the following months: WK Kellogg's stock price rose from about $10 to a high above $23 the following spring. Kellanova's stock price rose from about $50 on the date of separation to around $60 the following summer.\n\nThe separation also helped streamline the two businesses, making them more attractive prospects for acquisition. In August 2024, Mars, Inc. announced its plans to purchase Kellanova at $83.50 per share. An investor in the original Kellogg's\u2014valued around $55 per share before the spinoff\u2014would have realized about $87 in shareholder value if they kept both shares.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes Spin-Offs a Good Investment? Spin-off companies can be attractive investments for a number of reasons. Many institutions, such as mutual funds, routinely offload spinoffs that do not match their investment goals, making them a bargain for other investors. As smaller companies, spin-offs tend to attract less attention from analysts, providing potential opportunities for active investors. Finally, spin-offs are also attractive for acquisition, which can boost their share price.\n\nWhen Is a Spin-off a Bad Investment? Spin-offs can be unprofitable, depending on the circumstances of the split. If a parent company views a spin-off as an opportunity to shed an unproductive division of the company, they are unlikely to dedicate significant resources to investing in the future of the new company, or they may load it with excess debt.\n\nHow Do You Invest in Spin-Offs? Companies that are planning a spin-off tend to announce their plans well in advance, giving investors an opportunity to buy shares. In addition, there are also funds\u2014such as the Invesco S&P Spin-Off ETF\u2014that invest primarily in spin-offs and their parent companies, giving investors exposure to a broad basket of spin-off companies without having to research them individually.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSpin-offs have historically been attractive prospects, providing exposure to two different companies after the split. A well-executed spin-off can provide a significant boost in shareholder value, but investors should be cautious about spin-offs that are poorly planned or loaded with extra debt.",

            "content": "To truly appreciate the tragedy that unfolded in Manila in 1945, one must consider that up until then the city had been nicknamed \u201cThe Pearl of the Orient.\u201d Historian James Scott offers: \u201cIn the four decades leading up to World War II, Manila developed into a small slice of America in Asia, home not only to thousands of U.S. service members, but employees of companies like General Electric, Del Monte, and B.F. Goodrich. The city boasted a great quality of life, with department stores and social clubs, golf courses and swimming pools, all in a tropical setting, and at a fraction of the cost of living in the United States.\u201d\n\nThen in December 1941, the Japanese came.\n\nFilthy, ragged, half-starved U.S. prisoners were paraded through the streets of Manila after their 1942 surrender. The sight of their more physically imposing former protectors being ignominiously herded along by diminutive Japanese soldiers was disillusioning. \u201cFilipinos stood and watched in an agony of embarrassment,\u201d recalled Manila journalist Nick Joaquin. \u201cThese were the God blessed Americans, supposedly invincible. Now here they were: mighty giants being herded rudely by little Jap soldiers. We would never recover from that loss of innocence.\u201d\n\nFor the unlucky POWs, however, their three-year nightmare of criminally sadistic captivity was just beginning. 3,700 U.S. civilians were also caught up in the invasion; they would languish in the Santo Tomas Internment Camp, where they desperately ate dogs, cats, pigeons, rats, insects, anything to survive. On the eve of their liberation, the civilian prisoners starved to death at a rate of three to four per day. (MacArthur\u2019s Philippine guerilla network informed him of this, hence his relentless drive to keep moving).\n\nBelieving their new Filipino subjects to be an inferior race, the Emperor\u2019s troops had no qualms about looting food supplies and stores, while stealing vital farm equipment which left fields to rot. By the third year of Japanese occupation \u2014 with the exception of Japan\u2019s puppet Filipino government officials and collaborators \u2014 starvation was rampant, killing some 500 civilians per day. Hordes of beggars roamed the streets; some went so far as to dig up graves to rob jewelry, watches, anything that could be bartered for a fistful of rice. Parents unable to feed their children might abandon or even sell them. (U.S. intelligence reported that by 1944, it cost less to buy a Filipino child than a hog).\n\nOn February 3, 1945, U.S. troops entered the capital. But they did not find an open city. Instead they faced a fortified urban center they would have to take block-by-block, street-by-street, even house-by-house. This came as a rude shock to their five-star commander. Having thoroughly outmaneuvered his enemy, MacArthur expected there to be few if any Japanese left in the area. Other than its sprawling port facilities, which could be demolished before evacuation to deny them to the Americans, the city held no strategic value, as MacArthur himself concluded in 1941 when he abandoned Manila for the more defensible jungle terrain of Bataan, declaring it an open city. Therefore, the notion that Yamashita, a first-rate commander, would choose to defend Manila perplexed him \u2014 and then, as the destruction and carnage mounted, infuriate him. But MacArthur\u2019s assumptions had been correct; the Tiger of Malaya had no intention of fighting for the Philippine capital.\n\nYamashita, however, was dealing with a problem that plagued the Japanese High Command throughout the war. That was the intense rivalry, even downright disdain, between the Imperial Army and Navy top brass. In the case of Manila, while Yamashita pulled most of his army troops out of the city before it was surrounded, some 20,000 Japanese sailors under the command of Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi remained behind to destroy Manila\u2019s harbor.\n\nAlthough still technically under Yamashita\u2019s command, Iwabuchi and his men didn\u2019t see it that way. They vowed to make a stand, spending the weeks prior to the enemy\u2019s arrival throwing up hasty fortifications, sowing landmines, constructing pillboxes and tank traps. When the Americans approached, the Japanese in the besieged capital opted to get drunk and fight to the death.\n\nAnd the atrocities began.\n\nIn a mid-February letter to his wife, Gen. Eichelberger wrote with grim understatement, \u201cI hear the big parade has been called off.\u201d In fact, it would have been impossible to march down any Manila street as no thoroughfare would be free of debris and corpses, mostly civilians. By the time the last shot was fired, the Pearl of the Orient would be reduced to a smoldering heap of rubble, whose gutters ran red with the blood of innocents.\n\nIt is impossible to adequately describe the horrors the Filipinos endured. Men were bound and shot, bayoneted or mutilated en masse, while patients were strapped to hospital beds before the buildings were set ablaze. Females of every age were brutally gang-raped before being systematically murdered. Babies were tossed in the air and skewered on bayonets by sadistic Japanese who smeared the children\u2019s eyeballs on walls like jelly.\n\nFilipina survivor Carmen Guerrero Nakpil remembered: \u201cIt was like a scene from hell. We were running like rats. I saw my classmates dragged through the streets to be raped by the Japanese in the Bayview Hotel. I saw my neighbors cut down by sniper bullets. The killing was terrible.\u201d\n\nWhen the Japanese burst into the LaSalle chapel, Jose and Juanita Carlos were hiding in the cellar with their children. Jose was dragged off and killed. Then they came back for the rest of the family. Sixteen-year-old Dionisia was bayoneted until unconscious. When she came too she looked for her family. She found her mother and nine-year-old sister and six-year-old brother bayoneted to death, and her nineteen-year-old sister shot dead.\n\nAlthough it has been claimed that it was a spontaneous eruption of violence against the Filipinos upon whom rogue Imperial troops took out their rage for siding with the Americans (and fear as death closed in), captured Japanese records show that, as with Nanking, the massacre was officially sanctioned, even encouraged. One order went so far as to give explicit instructions on how to commit mass murder: \u201cWhen Filipinos are to be killed, they must be gathered into one place and disposed of with the consideration that ammunition and manpower must not be used to excess. Because the disposal of dead bodies is a troublesome task, they should be gathered into houses which are scheduled to be burned or demolished. They should also be thrown into the river.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, throughout the carnage of what has been called the \u201cPacific Stalingrad\u201d, courageous Filipinos risked their lives braving sniper fire and shell bursts to fill canteens and bring ammunition and food to the Americans hunkered down in the wreckage.\n\nDespite MacArthur\u2019s repeated calls for the Japanese to surrender, they resisted with suicidal desperation while the American commander anguished over the destruction of the once beautiful city. GIs accustomed to fighting in jungles and beaches had to quickly learn the ways of deadly urban warfare, in which every floor of every building, every stairwell, even closets, were bitterly contested. It was a brutal, often hand-to-hand, form of combat the likes of which had not been seen in the Pacific before, made all the more difficult by the number of civilians.\n\nThe Americans, wielding rifles, grenades, satchel charges, flamethrowers, sometimes even rocks and spades, eventually cornered the remaining Japanese in the one-quarter-square-mile fortress of Intramuros, whose walls, twenty-five feet high and forty feet thick, had withstood maritime raiders and earthquakes since the 1570s. General Kenney wanted to bomb the citadel, but MacArthur, aware that many civilians were trapped within, denied his requests, especially the use of napalm. But he did allow the big guns to fire on the holdouts. (In the end, the shelling was so destructive it didn\u2019t really matter.) Eventually the guns breached the walls and the Japanese, including the recalcitrant Iwabuchi, were wiped out or committed ritual suicide.\n\nWith tactics in the capable hands of his field commanders, MacArthur set out to visit the liberated Santo Tomas and Bilibid prison camps. The conditions of the internees horrified him. He was especially moved by the military captives at Bilibid, who made pathetic attempts to stand at attention. In his memoirs he wrote: \u201cHere was all that was left of my men of Bataan and Corregidor\u2026As I passed slowly down the scrawny, suffering column, a murmur accompanied me as each man barely speaking above a whisper, said \u2018You\u2019re back,\u2019 or \u2018You made it\u2019\u2026I could only reply, \u2018I\u2019m a little late, but we finally came.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the time the 29-day fight for Manila was over, and every last Japanese killed, the city had been utterly annihilated with some 11,000 buildings reduced to ruins and ash. 70% of the utilities, 75% of the factories, 80% of the southern residential district and the entire business district had been razed. Of all the Allied cities, only Nanking and Warsaw saw such destruction and civilian carnage. No one will ever know for sure but it is estimated that 100,000 Filipinos died at the hands of the enraged Japanese.\n\nOn March 4, 1945, Manila was officially declared secured. The smoking Philippine capital had been liberated, but at a horrific cost to the city and its bewildered inhabitants. CBS News correspondent Bill Dunn would reflect on the tragedy, summing up the horrible effects of war: \u201cThe Manila of 1941 was a unique Manila, a Manila that had never existed before, a Manila that would never exist again.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nBrad Schaeffer is a commodities fund manager, author, and columnist whose articles have appeared on the pages of The Daily Wire, The Wall Street Journal, NY Post, NY Daily News, National Review, The Hill, The Federalist, Zerohedge, and other outlets.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of GD\u2019s Deal\n\nValued at $188 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2035. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide construction spares for Virginia Class Block V submarines.\n\n\n\nThe work related to this deal will be executed in multiple locations, including Sunnyvale, CA; South Yorkshire, United Kingdom; Westfield, MA, and several others.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring GD Stock?\n\nWith countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military systems, including submarines, has been rapidly rising. General Dynamics, a renowned manufacturer of submarines that provides planning yard support and associated solutions for these submarines, enjoys a steady stream of contracts for submarine manufacturing and associated services like the latest one.\n\n\n\nVirginia Class submarines are built for modern missions, including anti-submarine warfare, surface combat, special operations and intelligence gathering. Effective in coastal and deep waters, their stealthy design and compatibility with other military systems make them vital to the U.S. Navy, strengthening national security and surveillance capabilities.\n\n\n\nSuch notable features of the aforementioned submarines are likely to have been boosting its demand.\n\nGD\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have driven nations to focus more on national security and investments in enhancing their submarine fleets. This surge is fueled by the increasing demand for advanced technologies like stealth capabilities, underwater surveillance and long-range strike systems, as well as the growing complexity of modern naval warfare.\n\n\n\nThis is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% for the global submarine market during the 2025-2030 time period. This is likely to benefit General Dynamics, a prominent contractor in the submarine market. Its Electric boat business division is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of Columbia-class ballistic missiles and Virginia-class attack submarines.\n\nOpportunities for Other Defense Players\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding global submarine market have been discussed below:\n\n\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries HII: Through its Newport News Shipbuilding division, HII is involved in producing the Columbia-class and Virginia-class submarines, two key assets of the U.S. Navy. The company provides fleet services to its submarines around the world, offering modernization, repair and installation services.\n\n\n\nHuntington has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 7.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 58.4%.\n\n\n\nBAE Systems BAESY: It plays a vital role in the production of advanced submarines, particularly for the United Kingdom\u2019s defense sector. BAE Systems is the primary manufacturer of the Astute-class nuclear submarines, which are integral to the Royal Navy's fleet.\n\n\n\nBAE Systems has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 58.4%.\n\n\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC: It is a renowned provider of missile launch systems for naval submarines. The company manufactures Launcher Subsystem hardware to support the Columbia and Dreadnought common missile compartment program.\n\n\n\nNorthrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 3.4%.",

The move comes as the commercial aerospace industry and GE, in particular, helped dispel fears of a slowdown in original equipment (OE) sales due to both Boeing and Airbus falling short of airplane production expectations and ongoing supply chain and parts availability issues at suppliers like GE.\n\nGE Aerospace in 2024\n\nIn the end, OE production and sales were pressured. Still, the strength in the commercial aftermarket more than made up for the shortfall, as flight departures continued to grow and orders for engine equipment and services outpaced expectations. The following data points show these dynamics.\n\nFirst, here's a look at GE's exceptional growth in commercial engine orders throughout the year. They held up well, even though GE had issues delivering engines last year. I'll return to this point in a moment.\n\nThe strength in service orders (which tend to have higher margins than OE) and better-than-expected margin performance led management to hike its earnings guidance progressively throughout the year. GE's management started the year by guiding toward $6.25 billion (at the midpoint of guidance) in operating profit, only to end it with an expectation of $6.8 billion.\n\nSegment Profit January Guidance April Guidance July Guidance October Guidance Commercial Engines & Services (CES) $6 billion to $6.3 billion $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion 6.6 billion to $6.8 billion Defense & Propulsion Technologies (DPT) $1 billion to $1.3 billion $1 billion to $1.3 billion $1 billion to $1.3 billion $1 billion to $1.3 billion Total GE Aerospace operating profit $6 billion to $6.5 billion $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion\n\nWhat about GE in 2025?\n\nAs noted earlier, it wasn't smooth sailing in 2024. GE's joint venture, CFM International, produces the LEAP engine for the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320 neo. LEAP engine deliveries fell significantly short of initial expectations in 2024. While that's probably a positive for profitability (new engines sell at a loss), GE prefers growing its installed base of engines to support future service growth.\n\nMetric January Guidance April Guidance July Guidance October Guidance LEAP deliveries growth 20%-25% 10%-15% 0-5% Down 10%\n\nGE Aerospace in 2025\n\nThe company is in great shape with services in 2025. Still, margins could be pressured as it needs to ramp up LEAP deliveries. In addition, management's guidance toward the lower end of the defense segment profit guidance range on the last earnings call suggests some margin pressure. The company's guidance for 2025 could be mixed -- something to look out for.",

Notably, the company\u2019s EV sales soared more than 100% year-on-year, reaching nearly 44,000 units, which positioned it as the second-largest EV seller in the U.S., as reported by The New York Times.\n\nFord Motor also saw strong results, with more than 530,000 vehicles sold in the final quarter, an increase of nearly 9%. The company\u2019s EV sales grew by 16%, reaching over 30,000 vehicles.\n\nCox Automotive, a market research firm, projects that overall U.S. auto sales will grow by 2.8% in 2025, reaching 16.3 million vehicles.\n\nWhile EV sales had a slow start in 2024 due to concerns about pricing and charging infrastructure, the fourth quarter saw a 12% increase in sales, totaling 356,000 units. The surge was driven by lower interest rates, enhanced incentives, and attractive leasing options.\n\nIndustry analysts speculate that part of the surge in EV sales at the end of 2024 may have been influenced by President-elect Donald J.

            "content": "Even as China appeared to have conducted the maiden flight of its highly advanced sixth-generation fighter jet a few days ago, the Indian Air Force raised concerns over India's adversaries increasing their aerial warfare capabilities at a \"very rapid pace\".\n\nSpeaking at the 21st Subroto Mukerjee Seminar recently, Indian Air Force Chief A.P. Singh expressed disappointment over the fact that the force is yet to receive the first 40 Tejas aircraft.\n\nThe IAF is still awaiting the first batch of 40 jets ordered in 2010. A major factor causing the delay of Tejas aircraft to the IAF is the late delivery of F404-IN20 engines from General Electric (GE) Aerospace.\n\nALSO READ: India's sixth-generation fighter dilemma\n\nUnderscoring that technology delayed is technology denied, the IAF chief said, \"We should go back to 1984, when we conceived that aircraft. The first aircraft flew in 2001, 17 years later. The induction started another 15 years later, in 2016. Today, we are in 2024. I do not have the first 40 aircraft also, so this is the production capability.\"\n\nAs far as China is concerned, it is not just the numbers, even the technology is growing at a very rapid pace, he pointed out. \"We just saw.. the recent flight of the new generation fighter which they have pulled out, the stealth fighter.\"\n\nA few days ago, videos of and images of a tailless Chinese combat jet, believed to be a sixth-generation aircraft, conducting a daytime test flight had gone viral.

That will require data centers, which will require massive amounts of power.\n\nGE Vernova Today GEV GE Vernova $300.26 +1.59 (+0.53%) 52-Week Range $119.00 \u25bc $447.50 Dividend Yield 0.33% P/E Ratio 54.00 Price Target $349.02 Add to Watchlist\n\nWhile the company does not offer carbon capture solutions today, it plans to make significant investments in the technology in 2025, which it believes will pay off when the companies running these data centers are ready to use the technology, which may not be for about five years.\n\nGE Vernova is also a way to invest in the growing trend toward nuclear energy. The company\u2019s GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy Alliance can provide reactors, fuel, services, and steam turbines needed for electricity generation.\n\nA Chip Off the Old Block\n\nFor decades, General Electric carefully built a reputation as a shareholder-friendly company. In December 2024, GE Vernova made two announcements highlighting the company\u2019s apparent intention to follow in its parent company\u2019s footsteps regarding shareholder equity.\n\nFirst, the company announced a $6 billion share buyback authorization. GE Vernova also announced its first quarterly dividend payment. On December 20, 2024, shareholders will receive a 25-cent per share dividend on January 28, 2025.\n\nThis commitment to shareholders is not just a one-time event. The company forecasts over $14 billion in free cash flow generation in the next four years. It plans to return at least one-third of that to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. With no net debt as it enters 2025, GE Vernova is giving investors a reason to own the stock even with a premium valuation of 163x forward earnings. Another reason is the analysts\u2019 expectations of approximately 46% earnings growth in the next few years.\n\nGetting Involved With GEV Stock\n\nGE Vernova Stock Forecast Today\n\n$349.02\n\n16.24% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 33 Analyst Ratings 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:$349.0216.24% UpsideModerate BuyBased on 33 Analyst Ratings Current Price $300.27 High Forecast $500.00 Average Forecast $349.02 Low Forecast $147.00 GE Vernova Stock Forecast Details Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE: WFC, which has a $411 price target, and Barclays, which has a target of $420.\n\nAnalyst ratings aside, after its strong debut in 2024, it\u2019s likely that there will be some pullback in GEV stock in 2025. The latest bump in the GEV stock price pushed it past a resistance level at around $350. Therefore, if you\u2019re not in the stock, you may want to wait for a meaningful pullback before taking a meaningful position. However, if you believe in the long-term potential of GEV stock, you can start to nibble on the stock now and use any correction as an opportunity to buy with more conviction.\n\nBefore you consider GE Vernova, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and GE Vernova wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile GE Vernova currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "How GM is using AI to expand America\u2019s EV charging network\n\nBack\n\nNext time you charge your electric vehicle in public, you might have artificial intelligence to thank.\n\nGeneral Motors is using AI and machine learning to help find the ideal locations for adding EV charging stations across America. It\u2019s part of GM\u2019s commitment to a future with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion, making it easier for drivers to consider going electric.\n\nGrowing EV adoption with expanded public charging access\n\nSales of General Motors EVs hit an all-time high in 2024 , but uncertainty about how to find charging stations remains a hurdle for many prospective customers. To help alleviate that concern, GM has proactively invested in collaborations with other industry leaders to add more public charging options and improve the overall customer experience.\n\nWe\u2019re collaborating with EVgo to build a total of 2,850 DC public charging stalls, including 400 fast charging stalls at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. These locations will feature high-power 350kW fast chargers, pull-through layouts for easier maneuvering, and many will have all-weather canopies and bright lighting for safety and convenience.\n\nAdditionally, GM has teamed up with Pilot Travel Centers and EVgo to add up to 2,000 DC fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J travel centers across the U.S., making it easier for families to do long-distance travel and road trips in their EVs. More than 130 of these locations are open so far. While charging, drivers can enjoy the dining, amenities and clean restrooms of Pilot and Flying J travel centers.\n\nPicking the best new EV charging sites with AI\n\nGM data scientists are using AI tools to identify strategic locations for new EV charging stations across the country. Predictive analytics and geospatial algorithms evaluate EV traffic patterns to select the best charger locations.\n\nThese tools approach site selection as a mathematical optimization problem. An algorithm evaluates key criteria including traffic flow and proximity to other chargers. GM also provides detailed maps to illustrate the model\u2019s decision-making process. The model\u2019s recommendations are then combined with expert insights to finalize the ideal charging station placement. Once the data analysis is complete, GM collaborates with Pilot Flying J and EVgo to make these precisely pinpointed charging opportunities a reality.\n\nThanks to AI and machine learning, GM is addressing the critical need for more EV charging stations in strategic locations across the U.S., helping to make EV ownership possible for more drivers than ever before.\n\nLearn more about how GM is using AI to accelerate an all-electric future.",

Photo: Yasuyoshi Chiba, AFP\n\nTaiwan \u2014 home to the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (\u53f0\u7a4d\u96fb) \u2014 plans to phase out its last nuclear reactor by May even as power demand is expected to rise in the coming decades. Efforts to develop offshore wind have also faced challenges as rising costs and worsening delays plague the industry, leaving the nation with fewer low-carbon energy options.\n\nHowever, Taiwan remains open to using new nuclear technology, Premier Cho Jung-tai (\u5353\u69ae\u6cf0) said in an interview with Bloomberg News late last year. As long as there is a consensus on safety and good waste management, Taiwan can have a public discussion about the use of nuclear power, he said.\n\nFor GE Vernova, which also makes small modular nuclear reactors, the global interest in nuclear energy represents an opportunity down the line, Strazik said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an incredible level of enthusiasm for new nuclear, but it\u2019s going to take some time to materialize,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very motivated with our small modular reactor technology that will be commissioned in Canada in 2029 with the first plan, and then we see it playing a more material role in the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nIn Southeast Asia, GE Vernova, which was spun off from General Electric Co last year, sees opportunities in nations such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where gas demand is growing as more data centers are sprouting and the need for electricity is rising.",

Earlier in the day, shares dipped as much as 5%.\n\nSEBI\u2019s letter adds to a series of challenges for Ola Electric, which is already under investigation by a government agency over its service standards. The mounting scrutiny could potentially affect investor confidence and the company\u2019s future growth trajectory.\n\nAs the company navigates these regulatory and competitive hurdles, adhering to disclosure norms and improving service standards will be critical to maintaining its position in the growing electric vehicle market. Investors and stakeholders will be closely watching how Ola Electric addresses these challenges.\n\nFAQs: SEBI\u2019s warning to Ola Electric\n\n1.

            "content": "The Sierra Club of Connecticut, an environmentalist group, is pressuring lawmakers into opposing efforts to transfer the Public Benefits Charge (PBC) \u2014 which passes along to consumers the costs of the government mandates imposed on power companies for a variety of state energy policies \u2014 to the General Fund, where it would face greater public scrutiny.\n\nThe PBC promotes \u201cclean\u201d energy goals, as well as grid reliability and electric vehicle (EV) charger rebates. Apart from standard service charges provided by power companies, this fee is the second highest driver behind state residents\u2019 skyrocketing electric bills, which sparked outrage as ratepayers saw it jump by nearly $48 for Eversource customers and $34 for UI customers this past July. In response, a petition to eliminate the PBC \u2014 started by Monroe resident Scott Pearson \u2014 garnered nearly 70,000 signatures, which he delivered to Gov. Ned Lamont\u2019s office, Oct. 24, 2024.\n\nIn December, the Sierra Club issued a call to action urging supporters to flood members of the Energy and Technology Committee with calls, and provided a pre-written script instructing the committee to oppose what they labeled the \u201cterrible Republican proposal to end the public benefit charges.\u201d Their stated goal is to have \u201c200 phone calls made before the start of the legislative session. (After that, we may start up again.)\u201d\n\nThe Sierra Club claims these fees \u201crightfully belong on electricity bills\u201d because they \u201cbenefit the electric system,\u201d but what they fail to mention is how these charges burden families already grappling with some of the highest electricity rates in the country.\n\nThe Republican plan seeks to shift this charge to the state\u2019s General Fund. This move would bring these initiatives into the open, forcing them to compete for funding like any other state program. Without this shift to the General Fund, ratepayers will be stuck with sky-high electric bills and remain vulnerable to future increases.\n\nConnecticut residents are being saddled with what Sen. Ryan Fazio (R-Greenwich) calls a \u201chidden tax\u201d buried in their electric bills, funding over 40 government-mandated programs at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n\nFor the average household, this amounts to around $500 per year, all without public oversight or accountability. In a statement to Yankee Institute on Jan. 6, Sen. Fazio criticized the lack of transparency, saying, \u201cThese programs are funded automatically through the hidden public benefits tax in your electric bill every single month, without anyone getting to question it, without those programs having to be actively examined and renewed by public officials.\u201d\n\nSen. Fazio highlighted contradictions within these programs, such as the state\u2019s subsidy of up to $1,000 for private electric vehicle chargers. He described it as \u201ca regressive tax on low-income people who have to pay a higher electric bill for upper-income, wealthy purchasers of electric vehicles,\u201d and noted it \u201cincreases demand and reduces resiliency in the electric grid.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that some programs, like energy efficiency subsidies, may theoretically improve grid resiliency, Sen. Fazio argued that all such spending should be subject to legislative oversight. \u201cIf advocates are confident that these programs can withstand public examination of their costs and benefits, then they should have no problem with them being examined and funded through the budgetary process,\u201d he told Yankee Institute.\n\nBut transparency doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for the Sierra Club. They\u2019re determined to keep these hidden fees buried in electric bills, forcing ratepayers \u2014 not taxpayers \u2014 to shoulder the financial burden of their costly initiatives.\n\nRather than scaling back, they\u2019re pushing to expand their slate of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and social programs, a move that would drive the PBC even higher, further squeezing ratepayers.\n\nThe Sierra Club and its allies are fighting to keep a system that forces Connecticut families to pay for their expensive agenda through hidden fees on utility bills. These programs avoid legislative oversight, allowing costly initiatives to escape accountability while placing an unfair burden on ratepayers. With electric bills rising, it\u2019s clear the Sierra Club cares more about protecting its pet projects than providing relief for hardworking families. Lawmakers must decide whether to stand with special interest groups or demand transparency and fairness for the people footing the bill.",

Let\u2019s get into it!\n\nSnooze Buttons\n\nIn the 1950s, General Electric changed alarm clocks forever by adding a snooze button. On top of the clock there was a big fat bar labeled \u201cSNOOZE\u201d and it could not be missed. One smack of the clock and presto, you just bought yourself a little more sleep. The first Snooz-Alarm clocks were built to let you snooze for 10-15 minutes. However, mass production required some standardization and in the 1950s a double digit snooze was too complicated to program into the gears of a clock at scale. So GE got as close as they could with a nine minute snooze.After millennia of trying to get ourselves out of bed at a certain time, the Snooz-Alarm dared to ask \u2013 \u2026do you really have to get up right now? And across the country people more or less said\u2026no\u2026I don\u2019t. The clock was a major hit. And as the technology improved, a few competitors ended up offering alternatives to the nine minute snooze. Like the Westclox DROWSE alarm clock.\n\nThe Westclox alarm clock gave people the option of snoozing for 5 minutes or 10 depending on if you hit the DROWSE button on its left side or right side. But the DROWSE button didn\u2019t have that sweet simplicity. Nobody wants to wake up and think about how much longer they want to sleep. People just want to sleep more. And the SNOOZ button gave us that. Or at least that\u2019s what we thought. Despite the fact that many of our phones are still factory preset to snooze for 9 minutes \u2013 today we all know deep down that the snooze button doesn\u2019t really give us meaningful sleep. And it also doesn\u2019t let us rise. Instead it catches us at our weakest moment. When we are least capable of making decisions. When it\u2019s far easier to slap a button than to put two feet on the ground. In the end, the key to waking up might just rest in not giving yourself any other options. And the key to more sleep? Who knows?!",

The typical bill for an average residential customer will increase from $155.96 to $164.46, according to PGE spokeswoman Allison Dobscha.\n\nThe recent bill jump comes after an 18% increase last year.\n\nState regulators approved the increase in December, citing PGE\u2019s spending on infrastructure \u201cneeded to ensure safe and reliable utility service,\u201d and the cost of buying power, which are stabilizing after large spikes in recent years, according to a statement from the Oregon Public Utilities Commission.\n\nThe approved rate increase is lower than what PGE requested from the commission.\n\nDobscha said such investments will include modernizing poles and wires, as well as a more reliable storage system for battery energy that would reduce the need to buy power from the energy market.\n\nPGE will suspend any disconnection for Oregonians who qualify for its bill discount program. Find more information about discounts by visiting the utility\u2019s website or calling 503-228-6322.\n\nThe utility is also forgiving up to $1,000 in past-due payments for its \u201cmost vulnerable, lowest-income\u201d customers and expanding protections for all customers whose power is disconnected due to cold weather, it said in a statement.\n\nSalem Electric has not approved a rate increase, according to Jacob Knudsen, member services manager.\n\nThe utility serves West Salem and some central and northern areas of the city, as well as parts of Keizer.\n\nKnudsen said Salem Electric has not determined if it will need to increase its rates, but it will likely need a \u201cmoderate\u201d rate increase by the end of 2025.\n\nHe said any rate increase wouldn\u2019t come until the third quarter of the year. It would be based on the utility\u2019s wholesale power suppliers\u2019 rates, which won\u2019t be finalized until mid-June.\n\nSalem Electric last raised its rates by 4.7% in October 2023. Its average bill for residential customers is about $120, according to Knudsen.\n\nA breakdown of rates is on the utility\u2019s website.\n\nPacific Power residential customers will see rates increase by 8.6%. The average residential customer\u2019s monthly bill will increase by $12.76, from about $145 last year to $158, according to Omar Granados, spokesman for the utility.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with an average increase last year of 12.9%, or $14.92 per month.\n\nThe utility covers much of rural Marion and Polk counties, including Stayton, Dallas and Independence, and has discounts available for low-income customers.\n\nWater and sewer\n\nA typical home in Salem will spend about $5 more per month on city utilities under a rate increase adopted in November by the Salem City Council. That means a monthly bill of about $128 for city water, sewer and stormwater service.\n\nThat includes a 50-cent increase in the monthly operations fee the city charges to support general operating expenses.\n\nDozens of community members wrote to the council opposing the utility rate increase.\n\nDuring the Nov. 12 council meeting, most councilors agreed that it is necessary to raise rates to keep up with rising costs and system maintenance.\n\nBrian Martin, the city\u2019s public works director, said consistent annual increases are necessary to both operate and maintain the systems, provide service and complete important infrastructure projects.\n\nThe 4.5% rate increases were recommended by a task force which included city councilors, Marion County Commissioners, representatives from the cities of Keizer and Turner, representatives of the Suburban East Salem Water District, the Salem Chamber of Commerce and the Strategic Economic Development Corporation, and two community members.\n\nSee the city\u2019s full rate schedule here.\n\nThe city has utility bill assistance available, including monthly discounts based on income, as well as emergency assistance for past-due balances up to $500 per calendar year. Learn more about the programs and how to apply here.\n\nCouncilors at the same meeting approved $400,000 for the city\u2019s Emergency Utility Assistance Program for 2025.\n\nNatural gas\n\nNW Natural, the natural gas provider for the Salem area, raised its rates in November by about 4.5% for the average residential customer.\n\nThat means a typical Salem home heated with natural gas is paying about $4 more per month. Residential customers using an average amount of gas, 55 therms, are now paying $82.74 monthly, up from $78.78, according to NW Natural spokesman Jason Cox.\n\nThe state Public Utility Commission approved the rate hike, which reflects a larger rate increase that\u2019s offset by a decrease in the annual cost of purchasing gas.\n\nBut state regulators didn\u2019t allow NW Natural to pass some costs along to consumers.\n\nExisting customers currently pay subsidies to connect new customers to the natural gas system, but commissioners upheld their decision made last year to phase down those fees and completely eliminate them by November 2027. In a recent statement, they cited \u201chigh levels of uncertainty\u201d about whether such subsidies would end up benefiting existing customers long-term.\n\nCox said that the gas utility recently expanded its income-based bill discount program, offering between 15% and 80% off monthly bills for customers with qualifying incomes.\n\nNW Natural has raised its average monthly gas prices for residential customers by $18.24 over the last three years, up from $64.50 in 2021.\n\nGarbage and recycling\n\nSalem residents will spend about $15 more per year on garbage and recycling services.\n\nThe increase is based on a rate increase requested by private haulers in November 2023.\n\nMost residential customers in Marion County would see an annual increase of around $15 this year, and $13.80 a year in Polk County, according to a report to the Salem City Council at the time.\n\nThat reflects a 3.35% increase for Salem residents in Marion County and a 3.79% increase for Salem residents in Polk County.\n\nOutside city limits, Salem residents in unincorporated Marion County will pay about 2.5% more for garbage collection and disposal. Marion County Commissioners approved the rate increase on Dec. 18.\n\nUrban households, like those in unincorporated east Salem, currently pay about $30 per month for a 35-gallon roll cart. With the rate increase, they\u2019d pay about 78 cents more per month, according to county spokeswoman Erin Burt.\n\nContact reporter Ardeshir Tabrizian: [email protected] or 503-929-3053.\n\nA MOMENT MORE, PLEASE\u2013 If you found this story useful, consider subscribing to Salem Reporter if you don\u2019t already.

            "content": "Portland General Electric is heading to trial against the state of Oregon over the fate of five acres of land historically used for tribal fishing at Willamette Falls.\n\nOn Friday, a district court judge denied a tribal group\u2019s argument for maintaining control of its fishing platform at the base of the falls. The judge also partly denied PGE\u2019s argument for seizing ownership of this area.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nThe case ties to a fishing platform built by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. In 2018, the Grand Ronde tribes reached an agreement with the state so they could build and operate the platform at an area of the falls.\n\nOther tribes took issue with the state\u2019s arrangement, arguing it denies equal tribal access to this crucial fishing area, according to court documents. They include the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and the Confederated Tribes of the Yakama Nation.\n\nFILE - Indigenous lamprey harvesters move slowly over slippery rocks near Willamette Falls, Ore., looking for the pools and crevices lamprey often hide in, July 12, 2024. Willamette Falls is a culturally significant place for many tribes in the Pacific Northwest, including the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde. Anna Lueck / OPB\n\nMonths after the state reached its agreement with the Grand Ronde tribes, PGE requested a court hearing to contest the fishing platform. The utility company, which has a business connection with the Warm Springs tribes, operates a hydroelectric plant near the falls.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nPGE, the state and the Grand Ronde tribes couldn\u2019t come to an agreement on the fishing platform over two years of mediation. In April 2021, PGE requested a federal easement that would grant all federally recognized tribes fishing access to the falls. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied that request because PGE doesn\u2019t own the land. That\u2019s when company executives asked PGE\u2019s board to pursue eminent domain.\n\nIn its legal complaint against the state, PGE says it needs these lands to maintain and operate its hydroelectric plant and fulfill its federal safety obligations. The company says the Grand Ronde tribes\u2019 fishing platform creates \u201csubstantial operational and public safety risks.\u201d\n\nThe Grand Ronde tribes argue that PGE\u2019s intentions go beyond safety risks, since tribes had been fishing in this area for decades without the company raising concerns. The Grand Ronde tribes contend PGE is primarily angling to benefit the Warm Springs tribes, which jointly own and operate a hydropower plant with PGE in Central Oregon.\n\nAccording to court documents, PGE says other tribal interests were a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d when it tried seeking a tribal fishing easement, but other tribes aren\u2019t driving its decision to seize control of this area. PGE asserts that \u201csafety concerns had not risen to the level that reached operational concerns\u201d until the Grand Ronde tribes obtained access from the state, court documents say.\n\nDistrict Judge Michael Simon concluded that PGE provided enough evidence showing it had real safety and operational concerns. Simon dismissed all of the Grand Ronde tribes\u2019 arguments. While Simon partially granted some of PGE claims, the judge denied the others.\n\nIn a statement, PGE executives said they were disappointed in the court\u2019s decision, but look forward to arguing their case for pursuing \u201cequitable access to all Tribes with cultural ties to the falls.\u201d\n\nGrand Ronde chief of staff Stacia Hernandez said tribal members \u201cremain committed to protecting our interests and the public gem that is Willamette Falls, and we look forward to presenting our case at trial.\u201d\n\nThe case is scheduled for a pre-trial conference in April.",

[Courtesy: Liaoning General Aviation Academy]\n\nChina has certified the world\u2019s first electric aircraft for commercial flight, according to the operator of the model.\n\nThe RX4E\u2014a four-passenger, battery-electric design developed by Rhyxeon General Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Liaoning General Aviation Academy in China\u2014received type certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), per a social media post by operating partner Volar Air Mobility.\n\nVolar said the aircraft is the world\u2019s first electric model certified for commercial flight under CAAC\u2019s Part 23 regulations for normal aircraft, an analog to the FAA\u2019s rule. While some electric designs, such as Pipistrel\u2019s Velis Electro, have been certified for flight training, none have been approved to carry passengers or cargo.\n\nFLYING interviewed Volar CEO Henry Hooi in April in Abu Dhabi, one of several locations worldwide it aims to fly the zero-emission aircraft. Hooi said the company will initially target RX4E operations in Southeast Asia before expanding to Africa and the Middle East, honing in on regions with traditionally poor aviation access. Use cases for the design, he said, might include private aviation, island hopping, tourism, agriculture, aerial photography, and even medical evacuations.\n\nRhyxeon, the manufacturer of the RX4E, first flew the aircraft with Liaoning in 2019. According to its website, the design has a range of about 186 sm (162 nm) and flight endurance of 1.5 hours, cruising around 137 mph (120 knots) with a payload of about 680 pounds. Hooi said its batteries can be swapped out in about 10 minutes.\n\nThe Volar CEO described the RX4E as a short takeoff and landing (STOL) model, with a minimum takeoff and landing distance just under 1,250 feet. He said that configuration makes the design easier to certify than the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis being developed by manufacturers such as Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation in the U.S.\n\nVolar told the South China Morning Post it has an agreement with Rhyxeon to commercialize the RX series of aircraft\u2014which includes the RX4E and several other, smaller electric models\u2014in 15 countries, including manufacturing operations.\n\nVolar did not immediately respond to FLYING\u2019s request for comment.",

            "content": "While Tesla, the world\u2019s largest electric car manufacturer, published global sales figures for 2024, General Motors looks only at the US market. Tesla is ahead in terms of electric car deliveries, but GM has risen to number two in 2024 \u2013 with 114,432 electric cars. However, the exact difference is currently unknown due to the lack of Tesla\u2019s US figures.\n\nHowever, GM emphasises that the company was the second manufacturer ever (after Tesla) to sell more than 15,000 electric cars in the US in two months \u2013 specifically in November and December. If October is also included, GM sold 43,982 electric cars in the fourth quarter \u2013 125 per cent more than in Q4 2023. That was enough for a market share of around 12 per cent of the US electric car market, compared to just 6.5 per cent in Q1 (with 16,425 electric cars at the time). The Equinox EV, which saw sales increase by 85 per cent in the third quarter, was one of the factors behind this surge in demand. According to GM, the model is now one of the top five electric cars on the US market. In Q4, GM sold 18,089 Equinox EVs \u2013 more than it sold in Q1 across the entire electric model range. For the year, there were 28,874 Equinox EVs, but the vehicle has only been delivered since May 2024.\n\n\u201cThe driving force for our business is new vehicles with great design and performance across our portfolio, helping our dealers satisfy more customers,\u201d said Rory Harvey, Executive Vice President at GM. \u2018We\u2019re carrying significant momentum into 2025.\u201d\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how long the Equinox EV\u2019s momentum will last: The model is built by GM in Mexico at the Ramos Arizpe plant and imported to the US. US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on 20 January, announced stricter regulations for US imports from Mexico during the election campaign. GM also builds the Blazer EV (7,833 units in Q4), also in high demand, in Mexico.\n\nHowever, demand for electric GM models has also slowly developed independently of the compact SUV. General Motors sold 8,084 units of the Cadillac Lyriq in the fourth quarter, compared with 28,400 Lyriqs for the year as a whole. For the Cadillac brand, it was the best quarter ever for electric cars \u2013 and in 2025, it will extend its portfolio with the large Escalade IQ EV.\n\nWith these results, General Motors has overtaken Ford in terms of electric cars in the US. In the fourth quarter, Ford achieved US sales of 30,176 electric vehicles (+16%). For the year as a whole, Ford just missed out on six-figure sales with 97,865 electric vehicles in the US \u2013 and remains behind GM\u2019s 114,000 units.\n\nelectrek.co, gm.com (PDF)",

For 2025, a reformulated proprietary phosphor blend will elevate the color and texture rendering of reveal light bulbs while also improving lumen-per-watt efficiency. The enhanced neutral, natural light provides vivid balanced light: the warmth of soft white with the crispness of daylight without a yellowish or bluish tinge.\n\nAvailable in a variety of shapes and sizes, the enhanced quality of light is projected to hit the retailer shelves during the second half of 2025.\n\nExpanded Cync Dynamic Effects Family of GE Smart Home Products\n\nThe Cync Dynamic Effects family of GE smart home products expands in 2025 to include caf\u00e9 lights and redesigned outdoor light strips.

The 24-foot product will start at $39.99, and the 48-foot version will cost $69.99. The outdoor light strips will be available in April in 16-foot for $79.99 and 32-foot for $129.99.\n\nCync Smart Keypad Dimmer and Smart Paddle Dimmer\n\nThe new Cync Smart Keypad Dimmer joins a redesigned family of GE smart switches. The keypad dimmer includes two programmable buttons making scene and group control available at the touch of a button. The new Cync Smart Paddle Dimmer provides a broad, smooth dimming range via the slider on the side of the switch and matches traditional paddle-style switches.\n\nThe entire family has been enhanced to make converting traditional circuits to smart lighting easier and more affordable. One Cync smart switch on a circuit makes the entire circuit smart\u2014no need for companion smart switches or additional smart switches. The inclusion of the traveler wire enables three-way connectivity without Wi-Fi enabled. Plus, when paired with Cync smart bulbs, the bulbs will respond to voice commands and maintain schedules even when the switch is turned off. Compatible with the Cync app, Savant app and Matter, these switches provide smart control over traditional bulbs.\n\nThe Cync Smart Keypad Dimmer will be $44.99, and the Smart Paddle Dimmer switches will be $25.99 and both will be available in March. The rest of the family will roll out later this year.\n\nGE Smart Lighting and Shading for Professionals\n\nNew for 2025 are GE-branded smart lighting and easy-to-install shades designed specifically for the professional installer residential channel. GE Proseo lighting and shades synthesize the brand recognition and trust of GE with the prowess of Savant's luxury-smart home control.

A Proseo switch starter kit will retail for $99 and individual switches will range from $30 to $60. Shades are custom and priced as such.\n\nSavant Smart Budget Upgrades Home\n\nThe trend towards the electrification of homes for energy savings and harmful emission reduction continues to intensify. Today, to add an EV charger, electric appliances, etc., millions of homeowners will need an expensive electric utility company service upgrade that could cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSavant Smart Budget is an affordable alternative that requires installation by a licensed electrician. The solution consists of Savant Power Modules that can be added into an existing electrical panel, as well as software that regulates the power output of the electrical panel, so the demand never exceeds a home's capacity. Homeowners interact with Smart Budget through Savant's award-winning app and, whether on-demand or on a schedule, they can easily prioritize how and when power is used in the home by monitoring live consumption, shedding unnecessary loads, and balancing usage within a limited electrical service.\n\nSavant Smart Budget starts at $1,500 and will be available in Q2 2025 through Savant's network of smart home and energy professionals.\n\nFor images and additional information regarding these announcements, click here .\n\nAbout Savant\n\nHeadquartered in Massachusetts, Savant Systems, Inc., is a global leader in smart home, intelligent lighting and energy solutions for consumers, businesses, utility companies and more.

            "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after investigating Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Portland General Electric is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.051 = US$551m \u00f7 (US$12b - US$972m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nTherefore, Portland General Electric has an ROCE of 5.1%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 4.8%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Portland General Electric\n\nNYSE:POR Return on Capital Employed January 5th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Portland General Electric compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Portland General Electric .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nIn terms of Portland General Electric's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. The company has consistently earned 5.1% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 43% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nLong story short, while Portland General Electric has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about Portland General Electric, we've spotted 3 warning signs, and 1 of them is potentially serious.\n\nWhile Portland General Electric may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

            "content": "The Acura ZDX is the Honda-owned luxury brand\u2019s first electric vehicle, but it had some help with it. And not just from Honda.\n\nThe ZDX is designed on the same platform as the Cadillac Lyriq and built alongside it by General Motors at the factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, that used to manufacture vehicles for the import-fighting Saturn brand. Talk about coming full circle.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader collaboration between the two automakers that also sees the Honda Prologue and Chevrolet Blazer assembled together in Mexico, but today we\u2019re focusing on the ZDX.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it was previously used on a short-lived Acura SUV that was sold from 2010-2013. The original ZDX was considered radical in its day with a coupe-like roofline and dramatic grille that were ahead of the times, but would fit right in with today\u2019s styling.\n\nThe ZDX Type S has a range of 278 miles per charge. Courtesy Acura\n\nThe new ZDX is a five-passenger model with two rows of seats just like the Lyriq, but it looks nothing like the Cadillac. It resembles the rest of the Acura lineup and pairs a tri-tone color scheme with a faux grille that juts forward like the bow of a ship.\n\nPrices start at $65,850 for an entry-level ZDX A-Spec model with rear-wheel drive and a 358 hp motor while the top-of-the-line and sportier ZDX Type S that I tested is $74,850 and comes with a 499 hp all-wheel drive powertrain. U.S. manufacturing qualifies the ZDX for the $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicle purchases.\n\nThe ZDX has a long wheelbase to help accommodate the 102-kilowatt-hour battery pack installed in the floor between the axles, which allows for a very roomy passenger compartment. The styling is very straighforward, nothing intentionally futuristic here, but it does have a digital screen for the instrument cluster and another touchscreen display for the infotainment system, which is augmented by a row of buttons and knobs.\n\nOne functional departure from the Lyriq is that the ZDX is equipped with the popular Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems. GM has stopped using them in its electric models in favor of Google built-in, which the ZDX also gets and requires you to download apps into the car itself.\n\nThe ZDX seats five passengers in two rows. Courtesy Acura\n\nThe trimmings feel slightly low rent at the ZDX Type S price point, but all of the things that you touch are top notch, including the very comfortable seats, which are heated and ventilated.\n\nThe ZDX Type S comes fully loaded with features like a 360-degree camera system, front and rear automatic emergency braking and an 18-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system. However, it\u2019s best feature is an air suspension system that is not availble on the Lyriq. It can raise the vehicle about an inch for snow or dirt roads and lower it to improve its aerodynamic efficiency on the highway, which contributes to an range of 278 miles per charge.\n\nMore important, the air springs and conputer controlle shocks smooth out the ride and turn the ZDX into a magic carpet, even on rough pavement. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a vehicle that rides as well at any price, and that includes the Lyirq.\n\nDespite weighing three tons thanks to the battery, the ZDX Type S also feels light on its feet and can accelerate to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds while firmly pressing your back into the seat. It\u2019s handling is surefooted, but if you push things too hard in a curve the physics of all that weight will eventually win.\n\nThe original ZDX\u2019s styling was considered radical in 2010. Courtesy Acura\n\nAll ZDX models also come standard with the General Motors Super Cruise hands-free highway driving system, which Acura has rebranded as simply Hands Free Cruise. It uses camera, radar and GPS maps to allow for hands-off adaptive cruise control on more than 750,000 miles of roads in North American and works very well. It can also check for traffic and change lanes to pass slower cars automatically, if you like.\n\nAll things considered, the ZDX isn\u2019t just an excellent electric SUV, but I think it\u2019s better than the Lyriq, thanks largely to the air suspension. Sadly, it is a dead end like the original.\n\nAcura and Honda\u2019s relationship with GM will not continue beyond the ZDX and Prologue as they prepare to launch their own electric vehicles in 2026. Will the ZDX name return once again? Acura hasn\u2019t said, but you can enjoy the current one while it lasts.",

Banach of Colonie, passed away on January 5th, 2025 at St. Peter's Hospital.\n\nBorn in Schenectady, New York, he was the youngest son of the late William and Hedwig Banach. He was a graduate of Mont Pleasant High School-class of 1964. That fall, he attended Albany Business College.\n\nIn his early years, he worked for the Carl Company and the Schenectady Union Star before joining the United States Army. He enlisted in the Army on April 12, 1967. Mr. Banach saw duty in West Berlin, Germany and served in Chu Lai, Viet Nam with the 23rd Americal Division from November 1968 to November 1969.

And the Honda Prologue continues to prove me right.\n\nLots of industry-watchers, critics and Honda fans wrote the Prologue off at first. After all, it's not even technically a Honda product; under the skin, it's a General Motors EV, re-bodied and re-tuned by Honda with some software tweaks unique to the family. Many of the naysayers believed it'd be an afterthought from another EV-skeptical Japanese car company, a glorified compliance car or a PR exercise to make it look like Honda's not totally behind in the electric race.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nIt turns out they were all wrong. The Prologue is clearly finding success all on its own with the strength of its specs, size, aggressive deals and the fact that Honda's willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a home or portable charger and covering some of those installation costs.\n\nHonda's 2024 sales data, released Friday, indicates that 33,017 Prologue EVs were sold in 2024. That's not bad at all for a car that didn't really go on sale in force until about the middle of the year. It even outsold the slightly larger, gas-powered Passport by about 500 units.\n\nGallery: 2024 Honda Prologue Review 2 Jeff Perez / Motor1\n\nAnd perhaps most notably, the Prologue ended up being the best-selling model of all the GM EVs: its sales trumped the Equinox EV (28,874 sold), Blazer EV (23,115) and even Cadillac Lyriq (28,402) in 2024. If these trends continue into 2025, we could well see the Prologue become one of the top EV crossovers behind the still-top-selling Tesla Model Y, a list that includes the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-E.\n\nI'd say Honda's onto something here. But that's not surprising when you look at the specs. The Prologue is a very \"normal\"-feeling EV that looks and operates much like a conventional gas-powered car, right down to the door handles. Spec-wise, it's quite solid too: powered by an 85-kWh battery pack, the Prologue comes in front- or all-wheel-drive forms with between 273 and 296 miles of range, depending on trim and equipment. Its maximum charging speed is a so-so 155 kW, and Honda says it can charge from 20% to 80% in about 35 minutes on a commensurate fast charger. Still, with Honda opting to include a Level 2 home charger, a Level 1 or 2 portable charger or credits for public fast-charging, owners get a lot of flexibility on how they want to \"fuel\" their new electric cars.\n\nAnd while some will still ding the Prologue for being a GM car underneath, I say: do most people even know that, and do they care? GM's EVs (n\u00e9e Ultium) are increasingly impressive in many segments, from family crossovers to luxury cars and even pickup trucks. Plus, Honda's dealers are generally very well-regarded for customer service; there's a lot to like about the Prologue, rebadge or no.\n\nPast research has shown that many American buyers think that the Japanese automakers, who were early pioneers with hybrid technology, are among the leaders in the EV space as well. That's not exactly true these days, but that perception is likely proof that people want good EV options from brands they know to be dependable and trustworthy.\n\nHonda is working to catch up with its own EV hardware soon and we'll see the latest advancements there this week at CES. I'd say that as it plans for an electric future, it had better be taking notes on how the Prologue is doing right now, because there's a lot to like here.\n\nContact the author: patrick.george@insideevs.com\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

            "content": "Electricity prices were a popular topic in global headlines in 2024. President-elect Donald Trump ran a campaign based on promises to slash energy prices for United States consumers. Ukraine is facing a brutal winter with punishing electricity costs on top of its already stressed and war-stricken economy. Europe is facing ever-higher rates of energy poverty and is desperately seeking solutions. But while problems surrounding energy prices are widespread, they are not exactly global.\n\nAround the world, people are paying vastly different prices for their energy. Prices can vary wildly between and even within countries. The four primary factors impacting your utility bill are the cost of the fuel itself, the cost of services associated with bringing that energy to your home, the weather \u2013 which impacts those services as well as the availability of variable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and, of course, the amount of energy you consume. Each of these factors is heavily influenced by where in the world you are located. These four basic factors are each heavily dependent on other local and regional conditions such as infrastructure, geography, domestic energy resources, energy policy, and taxes and levies.\n\nSome of the highest energy prices in the world can be found in countries that charge their own residents residential end-user electricity prices, including Denmark, Belgium, and Sweden. Meanwhile, other countries, especially energy-rich ones, subsidize their electricity so significantly that energy is virtually free for those who live there.\n\nSo who is paying the most and who is paying the least to keep the lights on around the world?\n\nIn 2024, Italy, Ireland, and Denmark had some of the highest household electricity prices in the world. As of March of this year, \u201cItalian households were charged around 0.43 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour, while in Ireland, the price stood at 0.41 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour,\u201d Statista reports. \u201cBy comparison, in the United States, residents paid almost three times less.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the scale, perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the biggest oil-producing countries in the world make up the nations with the lowest overall energy prices in 2024. These include Iran, Qatar, and Russia. In those locations, the average household pays less than 0.1 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour.\n\nGermany and Italy, which were among the countries paying the most for energy this year, were also the two top importers of natural gas in Europe in 2023. That\u2019s no coincidence. Net exporters of fossil fuels are able to maintain stable and low energy prices for their own domestic markets, whereas net importers are highly vulnerable to shocks and volatility in oil markets.\n\nEnergy prices in the United States are relatively reasonable, ranking toward the middle of the spread. However, even these comparatively affordable prices are proving to be punishing for U.S. households. The landscape of energy poverty in the United States is changing rapidly thanks to policy, industrial, and climate concerns. And energy prices over the next few years are shaping up to be a wild ride, as Trump promises to slash prices but also promises to boost United States liquified natural gas imports, which experts agree will drive up prices.\n\nA recent Department of Energy report found that increasing natural gas exports \u201cexposes a triple-cost increase to U.S. consumers,\u201d in the words of Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. Moreover, energy demand rates are rapidly changing in the United States due to skyrocketing consumption from data centers driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence, as well as a warming climate pushing residents in the South and Southwest to crank their air conditioners to new heights.\n\nOf course, the issue of AI and the climate are not isolated to the United States, and we can expect to see the average electricity prices fluctuate in many countries and regions in the coming years.\n\nBy Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

Although every company has to start somewhere, it's still hard to imagine this one started life in 1948 as a manufacturer of auxiliary engines for bicycles. In the intervening years, it branched out into Honda's many motor-driven products, from motorcycles, autos, and nifty little electric N-Vans, to outboard engines, robots for mobility and entertainment, and even airplanes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonda began researching and developing jet engines as early as 1986. This was well before the Honda Aircraft Company even existed: it wasn't incorporated until 2006. A few years passed before Honda got its first production plane off the ground, launching the HondaJet light business jet in 2015.\n\nThe HondaJet's roomy cabin, fuel efficiency, and flying performance won over the aircraft industry, and it became the most delivered aircraft in its category for five years. By 2018, the HondaJet Elite hit the skies and in 2022, the Elite II was introduced. Honda had established itself as one of the best private jet manufacturers.\n\nThe Elite II is a \"light business jet\" like the original HondaJet, with an aluminum wing and composite fuselage. Its over-the-wing engines present a number of advantages: not needing structural support to mount an engine on the fuselage or tail increases passenger space inside and luggage space in the tail cone. Moving a plane's engines from the fuselage also reduces cabin noise and vibration .\n\nAdvertisement",

Her long and storied life, as illustrated by her career and her interest, was characterized by her service to her family, her church and her community.\n\nMother Doll was born June 29, 1944, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Jack Clark and Mrs. Mary \u201cFrankie\u201d Partlow Clark. She went to school in Verona (Mary C. Wells) and Shannon, Mississippi. Residing briefly in Palmetto, Mississippi, Mother Doll eventually settled in her hometown of Youngstown and launched her prolific career of service.\n\nShe worked at Northside Hospital as a certified nursing assistant and then worked for General Electric, from where she retired with 35 years of service. Her unique name is what got her the job.\n\nEarly in life, Mother Doll devoted herself to the Lord\u2019s work as a longtime member of Tabernacle Baptist Church, then converted to Christ Centered Church under the leadership of Pastor Kenneth W. Paramore. She demonstrated the same sense of service to her church home as she did in her professional career.\n\nMother Doll loved her family unconditionally. Her biggest thrill was when she went abroad, traveling to Italy. She always wanted to write a book about her life in Mississippi. She worked hard in the cotton fields so she could get her family out of Mississippi to create a better life for her children and take care of her momma and siblings. She did just that.\n\nMother Doll leaves behind a large loving family, including her dutiful husband of 12 years, Jimmie Hendrix; her children, Christopher, Sherri, Vielinda and Robert (Jeannine); six stepchildren, Carla, Cara (Solomon), Chanell (Kenny), Eisha (Tom), Chantae and Nakia (Wendy); seven grandchildren; two sisters, Jean Walton and Stella Clark; and a host of other relatives and friends.\n\nShe will be greeted at heaven\u2019s gate by her parents, Jack and Frankie Clark; six brothers, Celevand Clark, Will Clark, Lewis Clark, Eddie Lee Clark, Willie Lee Clark and an infant boy who died at birth; three sisters, Dorothy Turner, Mary Ann Hentz and Elizabeth Williams; and son-in-law, Jimmie Baker.\n\nFuneral services and interment were held Saturday, Dec. 28, 2024, in Tupelo, Mississippi.\n\nThe ministry of comfort, dignity and love was locally entrusted to L.E.

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nAs a new year begins, General Motors is mighty pleased with last year\u2019s EV sales record, and well it should be. Along with Ford and other EV stakeholders, GM has put to rest all the doom-and-gloom headlines that dominated the news cycle in 2024. The only question now is whether or not GM will reintroduce the popular Bolt EV, and if so, will it feature parts made from mushrooms?\n\nGM Reports That 2024 Was A Very Good Year For EV Sales In The US\n\nComing into 2024, GM is proud to bill itself as the #2 seller of electric vehicles in the US, second only to Tesla. The sales gap between GM and Tesla is still rather wide. However, signs of a flip have appeared. GM\u2019s EV sales went up significantly last year compared to 2023, while Tesla suffered a slight drop in sales. If the trend continues, the distance between #1 and #2 will continue to shrink.\n\n\u201cElectric vehicle sales jumped 50% for the year and 125% for the quarter, roughly doubling our market share over the course of the year,\u201d GM reported on January 3.\n\n\u201cIn EVs, sales accelerated throughout the year, with Q4 sales of 42,000 units, up 10,000 from the third quarter level, and nearly twice the second quarter total,\u201d GM elaborated.\n\nAs recently noted by Motor Trend, GM does not make plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for sale in the US (yet), so those sales figures represent 100% battery-powered vehicles.\n\nAmong the highlights was the Equinox EV, which GM describes as a \u201cmajor driver\u201d of EV sales with an increase of 85% in Q4 compared to Q3. The Equinox EV is also a finalist for 2024 CleanTechnica Car of the Year. GM also stated that its LYRIQ model is \u201cnow the best-selling electric mid-size luxury SUV,\u201d which is the same thing GM said about the car in a recap of Q1\u2013Q3 2024 sales in a press release issued on November 19.\n\nCadillac has been leading all legacy automakers in the percentage of its sales coming from EVs.\n\nSo, What About Bolt EV Sales?\n\nSomewhat ironically or even sadly, the popular but ill-fated Bolt EV contributed to GM\u2019s 2024 sales activity as dealers continued to move the inventory remaining after production halted in December of 2023. GM CEO Mary Barra has reportedly indicated that the Bolt is coming back someway, somehow, but in the meantime, GM is focusing attention on the winning upscale EV sales formula of the Cadillac LYRIQ.\n\n\u201cFrom January through September 2024, more than 20,000 new LYRIQs were sold in the U.S.,\u201d GM reported in November, with more than 25% of sales occurring in just two states, Florida and Texas.\n\n\u201cEV buyers value three key elements: Range, design, and price. LYRIQ delivers on all three, and the sales success across America proves it,\u201d GM enthused.\n\nWith that mind, it\u2019s no surprise that GM has tapped Cadillac to lead the way on EV sales in the year to come. Late last year Cadillac launched two new EVs, the ESCALADE IQ and the OPTIQ SUV, to be followed by the new VISTIQ three-row SUV in 2025.\n\nTailpipe Emissions Are Zero, Now Let\u2019s Do The Supply Chain\n\nThe EV sales picture is also pretty elsewhere in the US automotive world. Last week, CleanTechnica editor Zachary Shahan ran the numbers under this headline: \u201cUS Gas Car Sales Down 1% While Electric Car Sales Up 8%,\u201d further reporting huge increases for Ford, Nissan, and Kia this week, too.\n\nSo much for the idea that America\u2019s love affair with EVs is over before it began. It\u2019s also important to look at the factors pushing sales of internal combustion vehicles down. Some of them apply to all sorts of vehicles, zero emission or not.\n\nNew cars are expensive, upkeep is expensive, rising urban congestion makes car ownership less convenient, people are holding onto older cars longer, and other alternatives are emerging, including carsharing and two-wheeled conveyances. Also, here in the US, most people prefer to buy used cars. Against that backdrop, the continued rise in EV sales is all the more impressive.\n\nEV Sales And The Rise Of The Mushroom Car\n\nOn the other hand, sustainably speaking, a long-term global falloff in individual car ownership would not be such a bad thing. It\u2019s all well and good to zero out tailpipe emissions, but electric cars are still cars, and car parts drag a long tail of air pollution and resource consumption behind them.\n\nSome automakers have been focusing more attention on supply chain sustainability as part and parcel of their EV sales pitch. The appeal to sustainability doesn\u2019t go far when people are pinching pennies and looking for a set of affordable wheels, but GM\u2019s focus on the Cadillac brand indicates that the company still sees a lot of potential in the luxury EV market.\n\nThat helps explain why GM Ventures launched a collaboration with the mushroom-based materials startup MycoWorks back in 2022. \u201cThe investment from GM Ventures secured joint R&D in an industrial partnership seeking to develop a Fine Mycelium\u2122 that best suits the replacement of animal leather interiors in GM cars,\u201d MycoWorks explained, with mycelium being the part of the mushroom that grows underground.\n\nIn a 2024 update, General Motors described the first proof-of-concept, a mycelium-based card holder for Cadillac. \u201cThe first demonstration includes materials showcased in an iridescent finish in a soft hue color palette, complementing the brand\u2019s bold and sophisticated design aesthetic,\u201d GM enthused.\n\nThat\u2019s just a baby step, but last summer GM indicated that mycelium will play a role in its future EV sales plans, as illustrated by its recently unveiled SOLLEI Cadillac convertible concept car.\n\n\u201cUsed in the charging mats on the console and the door map pockets, Fine Mycelium\u2122 by MycoWorks is ushering in a new era of luxury materials grown from mycelium (the renewable root structure of mushrooms). The material reflects Cadillac\u2019s mission to pioneer renewable automotive resources,\u201d GM explained.\n\nWhat About The Rest Of Us?\n\nThat\u2019s not much help for the average bargain-hunting EV buyer, so here\u2019s hoping that the revival of the Bolt comes sooner rather than later.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a quick look at one as-yet-untapped factor that can help accelerate the pace of EV sales. Most EV drivers prefer to charge at home, but that option is not available to the millions of potential EV drivers who live in rental housing.\n\nSolutions are beginning to emerge in the form of EV charging-as-a-service business models, along with new modular charging stations that eliminate the expense of trenching. Keep an eye on developments like these to stimulate future waves of EV adoption.\n\nFollow me via LinkTree, or @tinamcasey on LinkedIn and Bluesky.\n\nImage (cropped): GM is among the automakers celebrating a great year for EV sales, setting the stage for the Cadillac SOLLEI luxury concept EV featuring parts made with mushroom fiber (courtesy of GM).",

            "content": "Nuclear energy is gaining momentum as a solution for rising energy demand in a world trying to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) took the world, and the stock market, by storm in early 2023 and has not slowed since. Investors have flocked to the companies developing and producing the chips to power AI models, the cloud companies building massive AI data centers, and even the software companies deploying AI applications.\n\nHowever, the energy required to power all this innovation could become an increasingly hot topic in the coming years. According to estimates by Wells Fargo, AI technology's electricity consumption could increase from 8 terawatt-hours in 2024 to 652 terawatt-hours by 2030. Nuclear power could help solve this challenge. Emissions could discourage fossil fuel use, and renewable energy remains too intermittent to depend on alone. That opens the door for nuclear power, which is efficient and clean.\n\nAI's long-term energy needs could help fuel growth in companies exposed to nuclear energy, so consider buying these three top nuclear stocks in January.\n\n1. Cameco\n\nUranium is the fuel used for nuclear fission, and Cameco (CCJ -1.85%) is one of the leading uranium producers. The Canadian company accounts for approximately 18% of the global uranium supply and has controlling interests in uranium mines in Canada, the United States, and Kazakhstan. The company is poised for long-term growth as big technology companies and entire countries consider nuclear power as a way to meet energy needs while reducing carbon emissions. For example, Meta Platforms recently announced plans to source nuclear energy to power its AI data centers, starting in the early 2030s.\n\nIt's becoming apparent that nuclear energy is gaining momentum. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 63 nuclear reactors are currently under construction, and demand for nuclear could grow by as much as 2.5 times its current capacity by 2050. In addition, geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. ban on uranium imports from Russia, could further boost business for Western producers like Cameco.\n\nCameco's business has picked up over the past couple of years. Analysts estimate that the company's revenue will hit $2.3 billion in 2025. Assuming governments and corporations continue supporting nuclear energy, this could be the early stages of a very long growth story.\n\n2. Southern Company\n\nThose who don't want a pure nuclear investment could consider Southern Company (SO 1.07%), one of the largest energy companies in the United States. Its core businesses include electricity generation and electric and natural gas utilities that serve more than 9 million customers. Utility businesses produce dependable revenue streams because society's energy needs never stop. Southern Company's energy production also spans several sources, including gas, coal, nuclear, and renewables.\n\nSouthern Company has invested heavily in nuclear energy. It operates eight total power units across three plants, and its newest units were the first newly constructed in the U.S. for commercial operations in three decades. Earlier this year, Microsoft and Constellation Energy inked a 20-year deal to restart a nuclear power unit at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania to power its data centers. This potential game-changer for the industry opens the door for Southern Company, located near Virginia, the country's data center capital, to do something similar.\n\nIn the meantime, the stock offers a 3.5% dividend yield, compensating shareholders for holding the stock. It's not the cheapest utility, at 20 times earnings, but it isn't unbearable for long-term investors, especially if AI tailwinds rev up Southern Company's long-term growth.\n\n3. GE Vernova\n\nLongtime conglomerate General Electric split into pieces, and its energy business, GE Vernova (GEV 0.52%), now stands on its own. GE Vernova is a diversified clean energy technology company that deals in clean power generation, grid electrification, and wind and gas turbines. Its power generation business includes nuclear, providing reactors, fuel, services, and steam turbines for electricity generation.\n\nSociety is slowly and steadily transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives. Such a shift will take many years, potentially positioning GE Vernova for a multidecade growth opportunity. Management currently anticipates high single-digit revenue growth through 2028. GE Vernova is also investing $5 billion cumulatively through 2028 in research and development to drive long-term growth.\n\nThe stock isn't cheap, at a forward P/E ratio of 124. However, analysts estimate the company will grow earnings by an average of 46% annually over the next couple of years, so strong earnings growth comes with that price tag. Investors unsure about buying in here can nibble for now and buy more aggressively if the stock pulls back. That said, it's hard not to like the stock's long-term potential amid soaring electricity demand and a clean energy transition.",

            "content": "Portland General Electric Company's ( ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 13.3x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 19x and even P/E's above 34x are quite common. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nRecent times have been advantageous for Portland General Electric as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nPortland General Electric's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 51% last year. EPS has also lifted 27% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the nine analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 1.9% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Portland General Electric's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Portland General Electric's P/E\n\nGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\n\nWe've established that Portland General Electric maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find (1 is concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.\n\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Portland General Electric.

Towards the end of 2023, things looked grim at the company, with production problems, a chain of delays and software nightmares dogging its electric vehicle efforts. Fast-forward by 12 months, and GM somehow turned 2024 into a banner year, expanding its EV market share and posting record sales for all its brands.\n\nThe automaker said on Friday that its overall U.S. sales increased 4% to 2.7 million units\u2014its highest total since before the pandemic. EV sales were the real highlight, increasing 125% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2023 and surging 50% for the full year. GM sold a record 114,432 EVs in 2024.\n\nFinal quarter results are generally good for automakers thanks to holiday deals. But GM\u2019s EV momentum wasn\u2019t just a holiday spike\u2014it was a year-long climb fueled by a diverse lineup that spanned affordable crossovers to luxury SUVs.\n\nThe automaker had 10 fully electric models on sale by the end of the year across the Chevy, Cadillac and GMC brands. Nearly all saw significant sales growth in the final quarter and 2024.\n\nEquinox EV Leads The Pack\n\nPhoto by: Motor1.com\n\nThe Chevy Equinox EV led GM\u2019s EV sales chart for the year, racking up 28,847 sales. The bulk of those sales came in the last three months of the year alone when Chevy sold 18,089 units of the electric crossover. As the most affordable EV in the U.S. with over 300 miles of range, the Equinox EV starts at $35,000 before incentives. With the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit factored in, qualifying buyers can snag one for as low as $27,500\u2014if they meet income limits too.\n\nHot on its heels was the Cadillac Lyriq, GM\u2019s previous EV sales leader, with 28,402 units sold in 2024, including 8,000 in the fourth quarter. Cadillac\u2019s lineup is only getting stronger, with the Escalade IQ gaining traction (670 units sold in December) and the smaller Optiq and seven-seater Vistiq set to hit showrooms soon.\n\nThe Chevy Blazer EV did well too, with buyers snagging 23,115 units last year.\n\nElectric Trucks And Vans Played Supporting Roles\n\nWhile the electric crossovers did all the heavy lifting for GM, its pickups and BrightDrop vans also added some significant numbers.\n\nGMC sold nearly 14,000 Hummer EVs (pickup and SUV), an impressive feat for a vehicle that starts at $100,000. Meanwhile, the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV added 7,428 and 1,788 units, respectively. BrightDrop\u2019s electric delivery vans\u2014now under the Chevy brand\u2014accounted for another 1,529 units.\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view, the automotive industry is driven by momentum. General Motors has momentum on its side,\u201d said Rory Harvey, GM executive VP and president of global markets. \u201cWe showed strong momentum in electric vehicles. We have the largest EV share growth of any manufacturer. We have something for everyone, no matter what they like to drive,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Equinox EV is finding great reception and continues to break record after record in sales.\u201d\n\nQ4 2024 Q4 2023 % change Full year 2024 Full year 2023 % change Cadillac Escalade IQ 670 - - 670 - - Cadillac Lyriq 8,084 3,820 111.6 28,402 9,154 210.3 Chevy Blazer EV 7,883 463 1602.6 23,115 482 4695.6 Chevy Equinox EV 18,089 - - 28,874 - - Chevy Bolt EV/EUV 45 12,551 -99.6 8,627 62,045 -86.1 Chevy Silverado EV 2,176 443 391.2 7,428 461 1511.3 GMC Sierra EV 1,401 - - 1,788 - - GMC Hummer EV 5,091 2,028 151 13,993 3,244 331.4 BrightDrop Vans 537 164 227.4 1,529 497 207.6 Total 2024 114,432\n\nGM remains the largest automaker in the U.S. in terms of overall auto sales. And in the fourth quarter, its EV market share increased to 12% from 9.3% in Q3 2024. It was the second-best-selling EV maker across the second half of 2024, behind Tesla, which remains by far the largest EV producer and seller in the U.S.\n\nPromising But Uncertain New Year\n\nHowever, policy shifts may dictate how much of this momentum gets carried into the new year. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on items manufactured in Mexico and Canada, and both the Equinox EV and Blazer EV are made across our Southern border. Trump will also push to end the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit that made EVs more accessible to a broader audience. Buckle up, because it will likely be a bumpy ride ahead.\n\nHave a tip?

            "content": "Company Logo\n\nThe growing trend towards electric mobility, accompanied by strategic funding aimed at nurturing it, is the primary factor responsible for the upsurge in demand for drivetrain systems.\n\nElectric Vehicle Drivetrain Market\n\nElectric Vehicle Drivetrain Market\n\nDublin, Jan. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Electric Vehicle Drivetrain Market - Forecasts from 2024 to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe electric vehicle drivetrain market is projected to expand from US$54.941 billion in 2024 to US$120.330 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 16.98%.\n\n\n\nThe growing trend towards electric mobility, accompanied by strategic funding aimed at nurturing it, is the primary factor responsible for the upsurge in demand for drivetrain systems. Moreover, the increasing technological innovations in EV driving, in addition to government support and incentives for rising EV uptake, have improved the market's growth prospects.\n\nThis technological penetration is also forecasted due to the anticipated growing economies with high possibilities of EV penetration. Additionally, the design of the EV drivetrain is different from that of the conventional vehicle's drivetrains in that it is well-balanced to control speed and torque. Therefore, the extensive defaulting technology may be a persistent hindrance to the market.\n\n\n\nElectric vehicle drivetrain market drivers\n\nTechnological innovations in driving technology have opened a new market segment for its growth.\n\n\n\nWith advanced and emerging technologies, especially infotainment systems and sensors used more frequently, EVs are a great way to achieve future mobility. Correspondingly, the EV powertrain components and technologies have immense importance because they are converting the energy from an electric motor used for vehicle propulsion. Tesla, BYD Inc., General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, and Volvo are the primary EV manufacturers working to expand their EVs' performance by pouring in new technologies while signing up contracts with electric solutions tier 1 suppliers.\n\n\n\nThese joint ventures caused the development of a new scheme that facilitates the efficient use of drivetrain components, enhancing demand in the market. Besides, other technologies like the Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) and self-driving car technology are also causing an increase in the need for an efficient drivetrain system. This is because speed and torque management are relevant to the external environment and determine the mobility efficiency of the vehicle.\n\n\n\nElectric vehicle drivetrain market geographical outlook\n\nAsia Pacific is anticipated to have a significant share of the electric vehicle drivetrain market.\n\n\n\nThe electric vehicle drivetrains market is segmented by geography into North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. The APAC market is expected to witness high growth prospects and the highest market share. Some of the major economies in this region, such as China, lead to a greater share of EV growth globally. As reported in the 'Global EV Outlook 2024', China registered the highest number of new EVs with about 60% share, an equivalent of 8.1 million units in 2023.\n\n\n\nFurther, the same source also indicated that the rapid growth of the country's automotive industry has been mainly because of the increasing consumer demand for EVs. Thus, the positive investment environment enhances EV manufacturing and usage, in addition to the existing presence of the major EV players such as BYD INC. And Xpeng Inc. is also propelling the regional market growth.\n\n\n\nOther countries like India and Japan are expected to witness a significant rise in growth due to the aggressive strategies employed by EV manufacturers in enhancing their EV fleet and driving systems. In the forecast period, APAC is expected to have a considerable share owing to the mentioned factors as well as government-supportive policies and initiatives resulting in regional market expansion.",

Short GE slightly under 173.04, target n/a, stop loss @ 173.54 Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of GE as it gets near 173.04, but the downside target is not available from the current data. This tells us to hold that position if it is triggered until a new downside target has been established (updates occur at the beginning of every trading session) or until the position has been stopped. The summary data tells us to have a stop loss in place at 173.54. 173.04 is the first level of resistance above 166.79, and by rule, any test of resistance is a short signal. In this case, if resistance 173.04 is being tested, so a short signal would exist.\n\nSwing Trading Plans for GE\n\nBuy GE slightly over 167.05, target 171.54, Stop Loss @ 166.57 Details\n\nIf 167.05 begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy GE just slightly over 167.05, with an upside target of 171.54. The data also tells us to set a stop loss @ 166.57 in case the stock turns against the trade. 167.05 is the first level of resistance above 166.79, and by rule, any break above resistance is a buy signal. In this case, 167.05, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist. Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan. Short GE slightly near 167.05, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 167.53. Details The technical summary data is suggesting a short of GE if it tests 167.05 with a downside target of n/a.

            "content": "GREAT BARRINGTON \u2014 Public outcry prompted General Electric Co. to cut back on truck trips through the Berkshires as part of its planned Rest of River cleanup of PCBs in the Housatonic River.\n\nBut there will still be trucks \u2014 including an estimated 470 total trips running north on Van Deusenville Road, through the village of Housatonic on Front Street, and up the curves of Route 183, according to the most recent iteration of GE\u2019s cleanup plans.\n\nAnd there will be the sound and activity of machines at the site of GE's planned rail spur and staging area off Van Deusenville. There will also be railroad noise in the night, since the railroad company can\u2019t move the cars around during \u201cnormal working hours.\u201d\n\nSome officials want residents to be aware of the plans.\n\n\u201cDowntown Lenox and Stockbridge escaped \u2014 they no longer have trucks going down Main Street,\u201d said state Rep.-elect Leigh Davis, D-3rd Berkshire, at her last Select Board meeting. But Housatonic still has trucks, she said, adding that she hopes the board would continue to monitor the plans, particularly for the rail spur off Van Deusenville Road.\n\nGE presented its \u201cRevised On-Site and Off-Site Transportation and Disposal Plan\u201d to the public earlier this month in Pittsfield. The federal Environmental Protection Agency required the revisions. Public comments on the plan are being accepted through Jan. 15.\n\nThe presentation was met with some relief, given the reduction of thousands of truck trips by leaning on hydraulic pumping of contaminated sediment and the railroad to cart out the waste. But residents and public officials are still unsettled about the plan to dump the toxic sludge at a landfill in Lee that will be built just for this purpose \u2014 and built over an aquifer.\n\nNow it\u2019s Housatonic\u2019s turn to fret: the river runs through this village. And next to it sits a slice of forested land that GE donated to Great Barrington \u2014 with the right to use the easement for the cleanup \u2014 on which the company plans to build a rail spur and staging area here to pump and move the waste.\n\nOnce the work begins, it will be noisy. There will also be sound of rail cars being moved around after dark, since \u201cthe railroad\u2019s availability to move cars to/from the site rail loading/unloading areas will only be at night,\u201d the document says.\n\nThe revision comes as the company continues to tweak its cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls released into the river by GE decades ago. Now four scenarios are on the table for how to get the sludge from the river to either the \u201cUpland Disposal Facility\u201d landfill in Lee, for lower-level contaminated sediment, and to another out of state for more contaminated sediment.\n\nIt includes rail siding locations along the Housatonic Railroad right-of-way: Utility Drive in Pittsfield, Woods Pond in Lenox Dale near the Berkshire Scenic Railroad Museum and Rising Pond in Housatonic.\n\nGE recommends \u201cScenario 4\u201d as the most \u201csite-wide holistic approach,\u201d given its fewest number of total round-trip truck miles on local roads at 142,800, the document says.\n\nDespite news of these changes, there is still concern that Housatonic residents will feel battered by trucks, rail siding noise and activity. Davis said she was flagging the issue so that citizens can speak up during the open comment period.\n\nMichelle Loubert, who lives in the neighborhood, told Select Board members that she is outraged by the news, especially given other concerns she has expressed to the board about the railroad, and added, \u201cWhat about us down on Van Deusenveille?\u201d\n\nGeneral Electric, which used PCBs in manufacturing power transformers at its Pittsfield plant, agreed to remove them from the river and its floodplains as part of a consent decree signed in 2000. The chemical was banned in the late 1970s after being listed as a probable cause of cancer.",

When Toshihiro Mibe, the CEO of Honda, was asked recently what the strategic benefits of the new partnership were, Mibe-san replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult one.\u201d He is not alone in finding it hard to explain. According to Autoblog, the merger has been met with skepticism from analysts and confusion among industry insiders. While it could create a global automotive giant producing 7.4 million vehicles annually, critics are questioning whether this union is a savvy strategic move or a desperate gamble.\n\nFor one thing, it does not seem to be a merger of equals. Honda enjoys steady sales thanks to its strong hybrid lineup and loyal customer base. However, it has not been able to make a significant impact in the EV market, although it has a sales winner on its hands with the battery electric Prologue, which is based on the General Motors Ultium platform. So are the Blazer EV and Equinox EV, but the Prologue is outselling both of them.\n\nAs we speculated recently, the Prologue is a Honda first and an electric car second. People who have owned Hondas previously get in and immediately feel comfortable behind-the-wheel. Those who first experience a Tesla with its \u201ccomputer on wheels \u201d look need time to get acclimated to a whole new behind the wheel experience.\n\nBut Honda has parted company with General Motors. Although the Prologue is still being assembled at the GM factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee \u2014 and one Acura model as well \u2014 there will be no other Honda electric cars built there. Some industry observers believe that Nissan\u2019s experience with building electric cars may help Honda learn how to do so as well.\n\nHow Does Nissan Help Honda?\n\nNissan is having significant problems of its own. Sales are down substantially worldwide and particularly in the US. Autoblog says the Nissan dealer network is faltering and its EV lineup is stagnant. The LEAF was once a groundbreaking electric car that was a gateway to the EV revolution for many, but it now feels dated compared to other EVs on the market, especially those from Hyundai and Kia, while the Ariya battery electric SUV is languishing on dealer lots.\n\nAnalysts think the merger is more about politics than economics. They speculate that Honda may be stepping in as Nissan\u2019s white knight to prevent a potential hostile takeover by Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, which is famous for manufacturing the Apple iPhone. It has reportedly put its plans to bid for Nissan on hold until the merger talks between Honda and Nissan are concluded. While Foxconn hasn\u2019t entirely ruled out a future bid, the company seems content to let the two Japanese automakers determine their path forward before making its next move.\n\nFoxconn definitely is interested in getting into the auto manufacturing business. It now owns the former Lordstown Motors factory and has made noises about manufacturing vehicles for Fisker, Scout Motors, Tesla, and Saudi Arabia. Having it acquire Nissan would be a major blow to Japanese pride, but it could happen if the Honda/Nissan talks fail.\n\nThe Politics Of The Deal\n\nDespite Honda\u2019s insistence that the merger is \u201cnot a rescue,\u201d many see it as an attempt to prevent further destabilization of Nissan and protect Japan\u2019s automotive industry from foreign control. That may be why Mitsubishi is being included in the deal as well. There is rampant speculation that Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) played a significant role in encouraging the merger. By endorsing the partnership, METI could be seeking to ensure that Nissan remains under Japanese control, thwarting Foxconn\u2019s interest in acquiring the struggling automaker.\n\nWhat METI wants, METI gets. Most suspect the fascination in the Japanese car industry for hydrogen fuel cell powered cars like the Toyota Mirai and Honda Clarity was prompted by the government for political reasons, not any burning desire to bring hydrogen powered transportation to the world.\n\nIn theory, the Honda/Nissan merger could have some advantages. Honda\u2019s expertise in hybrid technology could help modernize Nissan\u2019s aging lineup, while Nissan\u2019s established EV infrastructure might give Honda the boost it needs to compete in the growing electric market. Additionally, Nissan\u2019s extensive manufacturing network and presence in Southeast Asia could complement Honda\u2019s global operations. However, the overlap between the two companies is substantial and it\u2019s unclear whether their combined efforts will create a stronger entity.\n\nThe Benefits May Be Years Away\n\nIf the merger proceeds, it won\u2019t be a quick fix. Analysts at AlixPartners estimate it could take three to five years for the companies to see any meaningful results. In the meantime, rivals like Toyota, Volkswagen, and emerging Chinese automakers are likely to widen the competitive gap. Carlos Ghosn, the former CEO of Nissan, has been vocal in his criticism of the merger. \u201cThat means you\u2019re putting control above performance,\u201d said Ghosn. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be successful.\u201d\n\nSince news of the potential merger surfaced, the share prices of Nissan\u2019s and Honda\u2019s stocks have fluctuated significantly. After soaring more than 60% on news of the deal, Nissan\u2019s stock has tumbled in recent days, driven by concern that investors would hold a lower stake in the proposed joint holding company. Honda, meanwhile, saw its stock price jump about 17% in recent days after the automaker announced plans to buy back roughly $7 billion worth of shares by next December. Honda\u2019s announcement helped alleviate earlier concerns from investors who worried that the merger with Nissan would negatively impact the company\u2019s value.\n\nAll this merger talk raises more questions than it answers. Why would Honda align itself with a company on the brink of financial ruin? Is this a calculated move to protect domestic interests, or a desperate gamble to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive market? Many CleanTechnica readers have suggested over the years that the EV revolution would lead to realignments in the auto industry. If even the CEO of Honda can\u2019t identify the reason why merging with Nissan is a good business decision, it\u2019s little wonder that others are wondering too.",

She grew up in Bridgeport in a lovely area near the sound named Seaside Village and attended Bassick High School, where she pursued a career as an administrative assistant. Subsequently, she worked in that role for General Electric for a number of years until she moved on to her permanent role and mother, housekeeper and home manager with help from her mother, Ada, who the children named \"Nana\".\n\nJoan married Bob Tynan on October 20 th , 1965, and together they built a loving home in Newtown CT. They shared 41 beautiful years of marriage and created a legacy of love, respect, and devotion.\n\nThroughout her life, Joan was known for being passionate about her community, the Newtown Congregational Church, where she was a member of the choir for a number of years, keeping her children involved in activities, and spending summers at Candlewood Lake. She loved the different holidays, with Halloween being her absolute favorite. Long after her children had left, she still dressed up for Halloween, decorated the house and had the neighborhood children enjoy the funny, spooky decorations and treats she had prepared.\n\nHer children survive her, Bob Tynan of Atlanta GA and Cecily Tynan Watson of Glen Mills PA and her beloved grandchildren Luke Watson, Emma Watson, Vivienne Tynan and Gavin Tynan.\n\nJoan will be remembered for her love of Newtown, her neighbors, friends and grandchildren, and could often be found cheering the grandchildren on from the soccer sidelines or Facetiming them when miles apart. We will also miss her ability to strike up a conversation with anyone she met and cherish the lasting legacy she leaves behind in the hearts of those who knew and loved her.\n\nA service to celebrate her life will be held at 4:00 PM on Wednesday, January 8th at Newtown Congregational Church, 14 West St. Newtown CT 06470 . Interment will be at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in her memory to the Newtown Congregation Church. Online condolences may be made by visiting www.paganofh@gmail.com.\n\nThe family wishes to thank Compassus Hospice and Glen Mills Senior Living for their kindness and care during this time. She will be deeply missed but lovingly remembered by all who had the privilege of knowing her.",

            "content": "These three firms are opening up the new year by announcing large share buybacks. One is aiming to return over 50% of its cash to investors.\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nShare buybacks are an important way that corporate management teams look to return value to their shareholders. Buying back stock decreases the number of outstanding shares a company has in the market. Because there are fewer shares, the company\u2019s earnings per share rise, all else held equal. Markets often see buybacks as a vote of confidence in the company's direction, as they reflect an investment the company is making in itself.\n\nBuybacks that lead to higher stock prices also provide more tax-flexible returns than dividends. Dividends paid by U.S. corporations are typically taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains. However, investors must pay taxes on dividend income when they receive it. Investors don\u2019t have to pay taxes on capital gains until they sell. This allows for a deferment of the tax payment.\n\nThis means that investors can keep their money invested for longer, instead of sending it to Uncle Sam. This can potentially create larger, compounded returns. Below, I\u2019ll dive into three U.S. companies that just announced large, and in some cases massive, buyback programs. All market capitalization and return, and implied upside figures are as of the Dec. 30 close.\n\nGE Vernova: Electrifying the World and Potentially Returns with Share Buybacks\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), the energy and electrification equipment giant, just announced a sizable buyback authorization of $6 billion. Shares have gone on a tear since they spun out of their former parent company, General Electric. A 152% return in 2024 isn't too shabby. The buyback authorization now represents just under 7% of the company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nAt the same time, the company announced its first dividend payment of $0.25 per share. The company's dividend yield is just 0.3%. But it's a good sign to see it providing income to shareholders so early in its history as an independent entity. The company has been a favorite of Wall Street analysts. On average, they have been raising their price targets as news and earnings reports emerge. GE Vernova recently announced that it has signed deals to power data centers with its natural gas turbines. This is a source of investor optimism and long-term upside.\n\nMatch Group: Swipe Right on Dividends, Buybacks, and AI Potential\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ: MTCH) also just announced a big buyback authorization. Its market capitalization is over double the size of GE Vernova\u2019s. The company\u2019s $1.5 billion buyback authorization equates to 18% of its market cap. Like GE Vernova, the company also announced the initiation of dividend payments. If annualized, the company\u2019s $0.19 per share quarterly dividend gives it a dividend yield of 2.3%.\n\nWhen it comes to returns in 2024, that is where the similarities with GE Vernova end. Shares are down 10%. At its recent Investor Day, the dating app company laid out its plan to turn things around. Unsurprisingly, it involves using AI. The company is working to implement AI to help people find more matches and turn matches into real connections. This includes implementing chatbot-like features that help users come up with better responses and transition the online conversation to an actual date. It will be interesting to see if these new features can reignite revenue growth that clocked in at under 2% last quarter.\n\nOlin: Materials Stock With Massive Buyback Announcement and +30% Upside\n\nOlin (NYSE: OLN) is a lesser-known name, but its recent share buyback authorization is anything but small. The $2 billion authorization was recently increased from $700 million. With a market capitalization of just under $3.9 billion, the authorization represents nearly 52% of the company\u2019s value. The basic materials stock didn\u2019t fare well in 2024, providing a total return of -38%. However, like Match Group, the company\u2019s Investor Day laid out how it plans to get back on the right side of the market.\n\nThe company makes many products, including chlorine, epoxy, and Winchester firearm ammunition. The company isn't focused on massive revenue growth. It expects these broad markets to grow at 3% to 6% annually over the next five years. Instead, the company aims to drive $250 million in structural cost reductions by 2028. It also plans to return over 50% of its operating cash flow to shareholders through 2029. Wall Street sees significant value in this stock. The average of two December price targets from Citigroup and Barclays implies 33% upside in the shares.",

Maxwell, 86, of Frederick, passed from this life on Tuesday, December 31, 2024 at his home.\n\nThough Richard was born on July 24, 1938, in Sayre, PA, to the late Lawrence and Francis (Deming) Maxwell, he grew up in the Buffalo, NY area. He attended Maryvale High School located in Cheektowaga, NY, graduating in 1955. He joined the Air Force after high school and became an avionics technician. He was stationed in McGhee Tyson Air Force Base, near Knoxville, TN, where he met his soon-to-be wife of 68 years, Barbara Jean Richesin. The couple remained in the Knoxville area where Richard received his bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee. He then went on to earn a master\u2019s in electrical engineering from Penn State. During the early marriage years from 1963 to 1965 he was employed by General Dynamics then went on to work for General Electric until 1970. Eventually, in 1993, after twenty-three years of employment, he retired from Hewlett Packard.\n\nIn 1976, after living in the Bryn Mawr, PA area, he moved his family to Maryland where they eventually built a home in Myersville. Richard was the general contractor for this home and did all of the electrical and plumbing work himself. Richard and Barbara raised both of their boys in this home where they were able to attend the nearby Middletown High School. He and his extended family vacationed at least once a year in the Thousand Islands area where pike and \u201cmuskie\u201d fishing was the primary activity for the men in the family. There is a veteran memorial park located in the Clayton, NY part of the thousand islands area that displays Richard and several other veteran Maxwell family members.\n\nRichard loved the art of conversation and was active in many organizations in the community of Myersville area, including the Lions Club, and Little League baseball coaching. He was also a Scoutmaster for BSA where he led a crew of Scouts on a high altitude 100 mile backpacking trek through the Philmont Ranch in New Mexico. His hobbies included, fishing, reading, traveling and hiking and was quite the history buff.\n\nHe will be missed by his wife, Barbara, his son, Terry Maxwell, and the late Suzanne Ottinger, and her children, Claire Coffey, Sabrina Barbe and her husband, Travis; and his son, Mark Maxwell.\n\nRichard was preceded in death by his brother, Elvin Maxwell.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 3 p.m. on Thursday, January 9, 2025, at Stauffer Funeral Homes, 40 Fulton Avenue in Walkersville, MD.

            "content": "Keypoints and Summary: The F-14 Tomcat, famed for its Mach 2.3 speed and air-to-air combat prowess, remains an icon of U.S. Navy aviation.\n\nRetired in 2006, the two-seat fighter excelled with advanced dogfighting capabilities and powerful General Electric F110 engines, which replaced its problematic TF30s.\n\n-Its presence on aircraft carriers brought unmatched air supremacy until its departure left a gap in naval aviation, as the F-22 could not operate at sea. While the F-35C offers cutting-edge sensors, its Mach 1.6 speed doesn\u2019t rival the Tomcat\u2019s raw performance.\n\n\ufeff\n\n-The nightmare question lingers: Was the F-14 retired too soon, leaving carriers without a high-speed champion?\n\nF-14 Tomcat: The Navy\u2019s Retired Speed Demon and Air Superiority Ace\n\nThe famous 2-seater F-14 Tomcat has found a permanent resting place in the hearts and minds of US Navy personnel and countless other aviation enthusiasts. The airframe became known for its advanced speed and dogfighting ability.\n\nNot only did the aircraft achieve Top Gun fame, but it is also known for going through an evolutionary process, resulting in a highly capable jet.\n\nA lesser-known ability of the F-14 is its incredible Mach 2.3 speed, which places it alongside the F-22 as the fastest US fighter jet ever.\n\nAs a two-seat fighter jet, the aircraft became known for its air-to-air prowess, given that several sets of eyes could monitor relevant targets, enemy maneuvers, and overall combat-zone awareness.\n\nWhile in flight, a pilot focuses on vectoring and locking in targets for the jet\u2019s weapons; an aviator can simultaneously track additional targets, surveil the surrounding area with additional line-of-sight observations, and offer time-sensitive constructive input and instruction to the pilot.\n\nThe presence of the aviator lowered the cognitive burden placed upon pilots and allowed for a more focused air combat platform.\n\nF-14: Retired Too Early?\n\nGiven its speed, carrier-launch ability, and overall performance parameters, some might be inclined to question whether the aircraft was retired too soon? Could it be brought back? Would that make any strategic and tactical sense?\n\nThe F-14 even received a massive and highly impactful engine upgrade, given that its original TF30 was retired due to performance problems and replaced with General Electric F110-GE-400 engines which \u201csolved\u201d the TF30\u2019s performance problems.\n\nThis adjustment helped support the aircraft\u2019s propulsion and thrust-to-weight ratio in a manner that helped propel the platform\u2019s successful combat performance in Vietnam, Libya, the Gulf War, and 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom. The aircraft was retired in 2006.\n\nThe Tomcat brought an unprecedented high-speed air-attack platform to aircraft carriers, which has not returned since the F-14\u2019s retirement in 2014. Did the arrival of the F-22 motivate the Pentagon to retire the F-14 quickly?\n\nIt is possible, but the airframe\u2019s departure left Navy carriers without a superior air supremacy platform because the F-22 could only launch from land.\n\nThe F-14\u2019s engines were powerful but incredibly problematic, losing as many as 40 Tomcats over the years. The Pratt & Whitney TF30 engines, eventually replaced by General Electric F110-GE-400s, effectively solved all of the TF30\u2019s problems, but many F-14s continued running the old engines well into the 2000s.\n\nThe departure of the F-14 raises the key question of whether the airframe\u2019s absence left aircraft carriers far too vulnerable and compromised the US Navy\u2019s ability to project power. The size of the F-22 fleet was truncated, and the Raptor could not take off at sea. Continued upgrades to the F/A-18 have certainly been significant for the Navy\u2019s maritime power, yet the craft lacks the speed and air-to-air maneuverability of an F-14.\n\nF-14 Tomcat vs. F-35\n\nHas the arrival of the F-35C and F-35B compensated for lacking an F-14 in a Carrier Strike Group? To an extent, this may be true, yet the F/A-18 is nowhere near as fast as the F-14, and clearly, the US Navy could have continued to upgrade and extend the service life of its Tomcat fleet just as it has done with the Hornet F/A-18 E/F.\n\nThe F-35C only reaches speeds of Mach 1.6 and, therefore, does not rival the pure speed of a Tomcat. However, its next-generation sensors might remove any need for the aircraft to have to engage in any dogfight or air-to-air combat engagement.\n\nAbout the Author: Kris Osborn\n\nKris Osborn is the Military Technology Editor of 19FortyFive and President of Warrior Maven \u2013 Center for Military Modernization.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stands against the other industrial stocks.\n\nAs 2024 comes to an end, the flagship S&P index is up by 25.9% year to date, driven primarily by technology stocks and investors rushing to pile into artificial intelligence. Additionally, as opposed to earlier worries of a recession, the US GDP has continued to grow as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), America's economy grew by 3.1% in Q3. According to the IMF, the US GDP is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and stand out from most of the developed world and China.\n\nYet, while technology stocks and the industry are eye-catching, they are not the only components of the economy. In 2024, while the overall economy has grown, some sectors haven't done well. One sector that's often perceived to be the pulse of the economy is the industrial sector. It measures output from large-scale plants, and in today's era of high interest rates, industrial stocks haven't done too well.\n\nFor instance, while the broader S&P is up 25.9%, its industrial component has managed to post 16.94% in gains this year. The sluggishness in the industrial sector hasn't gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer either. On the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points but reduced 2025's projected rate cuts to two from an earlier four, Cramer commented on the state of the American economy ahead of the Fed's announcement.\n\nHe outlined the need to look at other sectors apart from technology. \"Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks,\" said Cramer, adding \"There are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn\u2019t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!\u201d Cramer wondered why the Fed was cutting rates at all since the economy appeared to be quite robust. He stressed the need to sift through the data to find out the real state of the economy. According to Cramer, \"So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that if you look at what we\u2019re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it\u2019s not strong either if you count colds.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host wasn't convinced by the Atlanta Fed's estimate of the US GDP growing by 3.2% in Q4. He stated that he was \"trying to find why. I\u2019m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel\u2019s very strong yeah. Leisure\u2019s very strong. Dining out\u2019s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they\u2019re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don\u2019t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.\u201d",

Sign up\n\nIt's the dawn of a new era for infrastructure spending\n\nAmerica's manufacturing industry is beginning to reassert itself. The dominance of U.S. industrial firms began to decline when China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Back then, American industrial companies made up roughly 12% of the market value of the S&P 500.\n\nBut cheap labor abroad and a focus on globalization helped to undermine the sector, as companies moved manufacturing overseas. (At the same time, the soaring fortunes of technology-related firms shifted market leadership in their direction.) Today, industrial stocks represent just over 8.5% of the S&P 500.\n\nBut the tide is turning. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the downsides of operating some businesses on an international scale. Think back to the floating traffic jam of 50 container ships in the Pacific Ocean waiting to dock in California in 2021. Such supply-chain snafus increasingly spurred domestic companies to bring production back to the U.S., and some foreign firms are building manufacturing plants in the U.S. to be closer to their American customers.\n\nAs the shift got under way, it became abundantly clear that the country's aging infrastructure, after decades of underinvestment, badly needed an upgrade, from the power grid to railways, bridges, highways and airports. Politicians on both sides of the political aisle agreed. Between 2021 and the end of 2022, lawmakers decided to allocate nearly $2 trillion in federal funding and other incentives to restore manufacturing in America and upgrade the country's infrastructure through a combination of three acts: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\n\"This massive investment could drive long-term growth for the industrials sector for years to come,\" says Fidelity's David Wagner , who runs the firm's Select Industrials Portfolio.\n\nMore than 60,000 projects have been announced as part of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including 10,000 bridge projects, 175,000 miles of roadway repairs and 1,100 airport modernization projects, among other things.\n\nNearly $60 million, for instance, will pay for a seventh runway, as well as other upgrades, at Denver International Airport. And $30 billion of the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act has been earmarked to help fund 23 projects, including 16 new semiconductor manufacturing facilities in 15 states so far. Two years ago, the U.S. produced none of the world's most advanced chips, according to the government. By 2032, the country will produce nearly 30% of the global supply of leading-edge chips.\n\nIndeed, an unprecedented amount of spending is being \"funneled into a relatively small area of the U.S. economy,\" says Yung-Yu Ma , chief investment officer of BMO Wealth Management, who has been recommending that investors allocate a bigger percentage of their portfolio to U.S. infrastructure since early 2023. \"These trends are strong and durable,\" he says.\n\nThere's room for infrastructure stocks to run\n\nJudging by the soaring returns in some bellwether stocks, the industrial renaissance is well underway. Industrial giants such as Caterpillar (CAT), GE Aerospace (GE) and RTX (RTX) have each posted gains of more than 50% over the past 12 months \u2013 ahead of the 34% climb in the S&P 500.\n\nThere's even an artificial intelligence (AI) angle to some infrastructure stocks that is fueling share-price increases. Mounting demand for data centers to handle AI tasks, for instance, has pushed shares in Digital Realty Trust (DLR), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in data centers, up 45% over the past 12 months. The stock now trades at a five-year-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on estimated earnings for the year ahead.\n\nBut it's not too late for investors to cash in on the infrastructure rally. For starters, only a relatively small portion \u2013 roughly 20% \u2013 of the total money set aside in the spending bills has been spent so far. And these projects take time to get up and running. \"We're in the middle of the third inning of the infrastructure trend. There's still a good way to go,\" Ma says.\n\nThe best infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nGiven the breadth of spending that the infrastructure bills cover, there are many ways for investors to cash in on the industrial renaissance. \"You're seeing this wide array of project announcements \u2013 in the energy sector, in commercial infrastructure, public infrastructure, utilities,\" says Fidelity's Wagner. \"It's multifaceted, which is different than other up cycles in industrials. It's not a play on one end market or one subindustry cycle.\"\n\nWe've highlighted seven companies, in a variety of industries, that we expect to benefit from infrastructure spending. Be patient with these investments. Some may win over the near term, but most may take time to pay off.\n\n\"We're not building these factories in days or months. They're going to take quarters and years,\" says Jason Adams , who runs T. Rowe Price Global Industrials fund. \"There's still a lot of buildout to go.\" Returns and data for the investments below are through November 30, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAecom\n\n(Image credit: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nBig construction projects need to be managed efficiently, and that's what Aecom (ACM) does. The infrastructure professional-services firm plays the role of maestro over the life of a building project. It also offers advisory, planning, design and engineering services \u2013 and more.\n\n\"Aecom is a high-quality, low-risk way to play secular growth in global infrastructure,\" says Truist Securities analyst Jamie Cook , who recommends the large-cap stock .\n\nNew contracts at home and abroad are flowing in. Roughly three-fourths of the company's business is stateside. In October, Aecom won a Texas Department of Transportation contract to provide design services for a segment of Highway I-45 in Houston. And in September, it agreed to manage the construction of a new terminal at San Diego International Airport, among other improvement projects there.\n\nAnother fourth of Aecom's business is overseas, and last fall it won separate contracts for services in water-supply programs in South Africa and the U.K., as well as a rapid-transport project in Bangkok to design tunnels and tunnel ventilation systems, among other things.\n\n\"We expect growing demand for environmental, road and water projects to provide the company's design and consulting service with a stable source of revenue,\" says Argus Research analyst John Staszak , who rates the stock a Buy.\n\nThe recent contract wins have helped boost shares 28% since the start of 2024. Yet the stock is still relatively inexpensive. It trades at 23 times expected 2025 earnings \u2013 a discount to other engineering and research-and-development services firms, which trade at a median P/E of 26, according to Zacks Investment Research.\n\nEaton\n\n(Image credit: Raymond Boyd/Getty Images)\n\nElectricity demand is expected to soar thanks to the use of artificial intelligence, reshoring efforts, and the growing adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy.\n\n\"We expect electricity demand to double between now and 2050,\" says Bernstein Research analyst Chad Dillard . To put that in perspective, over the next five years, electricity demand could increase at an average annual pace of 1.7%, which is far faster than the 0.4% annual growth rate in demand over the past decade.\n\nTo keep up, utilities must upgrade their electrical infrastructure. Spending on electrical equipment could rise by as much as 3% to 7% per year, on average. As a result, electrical-equipment manufacturers such as Eaton (ETN) are poised to deliver double-digit earnings growth, says Dillard.\n\nEaton makes electrical systems and components for end users in multiple sectors and industries, including utilities, manufacturing, commercial and residential property, automakers, aviation, and technology. The company's broad array of customers makes Eaton a beneficiary of several megatrends, including the upgrade of America's power grid as well as the buildout of data centers. An aging airplane fleet amid a rise in air-travel demand is boosting orders for Eaton's aerospace equipment.\n\nShares have climbed 67% over the past 12 months, so don't expect a similar pop in 2025. But there's still upside left, says UBS Securities analyst Amit Mehrotra , whose 12-month price target for the stock, $431, represents a 15% gain from the current share price.\n\n\"We think the company can sustain high-single-digit revenue growth for several years to come,\" says Mehrotra \u2013 a respectable pace for a company with a $148 billion market value. The company's plan to buy back nearly $14 billion in shares over the next four years also bodes well for the stock.\n\nAnd despite the runup, Eaton's stock isn't expensive relative to peers. Its P/E of just 31 is a tad below the machinery and electrical equipment industry and is justified by estimates of 12% earnings growth over each of the next three years \u2013 a smidge ahead of its peers. Still, we'd be on the lookout for lower entry points to pounce on the stock.\n\nGE Vernova\n\n(Image credit: Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nGE Vernova (GEV) \u2013 an energy equipment and services company \u2013 was formed last year from the merger and then spinoff of General Electric's various energy businesses , including renewable energy, power, digital and energy financial services. The stock has been trading only since April 2024. (General Electric shareholders received one share of GE Vernova for every four shares of GE.) But given its provenance, GE Vernova is a powerhouse. Its natural gas and wind turbines generate roughly 30% of the planet's electricity, according to the company.\n\nThat puts the firm in position to gain from the world's rising demand for power. But GE Vernova is also a player in the transition to a larger and more sustainable electric power system. About $73 billion of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is pegged to grants that will encourage investment in energy efficiency, greenhouse-gas emission reduction and clean-energy technologies \u2013 and that's the stomping ground of GE Vernova's electrification business segment, which among other things is working to leverage AI to build a digital power grid.\n\nIt is possible that under President Trump, renewable energy may get less attention and money, which would be bad news for GE Vernova's electrification business. But William Blair Research analyst Jed Dorsheimer says Trump's nominee for Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, is likely good news for GE Vernova's power-generation business, which is dominated by natural gas power and represents 40% of overall revenue. The reason: Wright is chief executive of Liberty Energy (LBRT), a fracking company. (Vernova's power business also includes hydroelectric, nuclear and steam power.)\n\nGE Vernova's sky-high P/E of 50 is a negative, for sure. But \"the Street is underestimating the company's growth potential,\" says Jefferies Financial Group analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith . After a 7% climb in revenues in 2024, he expects sales growth to tick up 12% in 2025 and 9% in 2026.\n\nAll of the firm's three business segments \u2013 power, wind and electrification \u2013 seem poised to do well in 2025, he adds; its wind business has been a drag of late but is improving. For the company overall, Dumoulin-Smith estimates 40% average annual growth in earnings before income tax and interest over the next three years, due in part to pruning of the unprofitable wind business and big gains in its larger businesses, power and electrification. We'd still be choosy about entry points with this utility stock ; it's best to buy on dips.\n\nRockwell Automation\n\n(Image credit: Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nA significant portion of the equipment in factories dates to the 1970s and 1980s and needs an upgrade, says Morningstar stock analyst Nicholas Lieb . That works in Rockwell Automation's (ROK) favor because the company makes equipment and software products that help factories automate their processes and operate more efficiently.\n\nROK's analytic software helped Kraft Heinz (KHZ) improve the operational efficiency of its Ore-Ida potato products facility in Oregon. From peeling potatoes to packaging the products, the system increased Ore-Ida's production capacity by 10%.\n\nRockwell also helps its customers maintain and update their systems. A dedicated phone line at a mill for International Paper (IP) is connected to Rockwell engineers to help monitor and troubleshoot operations. \"Without this help from Rockwell, International Paper would be forced to hire another engineer,\" says Lieb, which could cost the company more.\n\nBut a slump in global manufacturing has weighed on Rockwell shares over the past 12 months. Elevated interest rates (and thus higher borrowing costs) made many of the company's customers cautious about spending on new equipment. At the same time, a surfeit of goods (a post-pandemic outcome following supply-chain challenges) prompted many manufacturers to pause production and wait for demand to catch up with supply. In its most recent fiscal year , which ended in September, Rockwell's revenues dipped by 9% and earnings by 20%. That drag could extend into 2025.\n\nRockwell hasn't been sitting on its hands. In the summer of 2024, the company announced plans to lay off 3% of its global workforce. It has been buying back stock, too. In 2024, it repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $270. Even so, investors have been unenthusiastic, and the stock has gained just 9% over the past 12 months.\n\nThough Rockwell shares are not expensive, they're not a screaming bargain either. The stock trades at 31 times earnings, which is on par with the stock's median P/E over the past decade. But for patient investors, Rockwell could pay off. Although a consensus of analysts expects earnings growth to contract by 2.5% in 2025 compared with 2024 levels, things will look up in 2026, when analysts project a 19% jump in profits.\n\nUnited Rentals\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nReshoring requires equipment to build things. But construction companies have been opting more and more to rent equipment rather than to buy and maintain it on their own, says Jason Adams, manager of T. Rowe Price Global Industrials fund. That puts United Rentals (URI), a rental company with a large and diverse fleet of construction equipment, in good shape to benefit from large infrastructure projects.\n\nUnited is already busy. It has been supplying equipment for several large-scale construction projects, including a 131-acre entertainment and shopping complex in Miami that will feature a new stadium for the city's major-league soccer team. Smaller projects have been on pause, but as interest rates continue to fall, lower borrowing costs should spur more activity on that front, says Value Line analyst Nils Van Liew . And acquisitions of smaller companies that complement United's business could boost growth.\n\nThe catch: Shares are up 83% over the past 12 months. They currently trade at 18 times earnings \u2013 level with the rest of the building- and construction-products market, but ahead of the stock's 10-year historical P/E of 12. Shares could tread water while United digests recent gains.\n\nVulcan Materials\n\n(Image credit: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nVulcan Materials (VMC) is the leading rock quarry company in the U.S. That means as more liquid natural gas facilities, warehouses, battery plants and factories are constructed here, \"Vulcan is going to sell a lot of rock to build the foundations,\" says Bruce Kennedy , a portfolio manager of DF Dent Midcap Growth. \"Rock has been used to build roads since the days of Babylon,\" he adds. \"And there are no other substitutes.\"\n\nVulcan makes money by selling crushed rock \u2013 and it pulls in even more to ship it. Many of Vulcan's quarries and distribution yards are near fast-growing metro areas of the U.S. (cities in Texas, North and South Carolina, and Florida, for example). New permits for quarries are hard to come by, which diminishes threats from competitors, giving the company both \"pricing power and low obsolescence risk,\" says Kennedy. And Vulcan boasts a materials reserve of 69 years, at current levels of production.\n\nAccording to Zacks, analysts expect average annual earnings growth of 14.5% over the next three years, better than the 9.6% pace the company recorded over the past five years. Kennedy expects earnings to jump 22.5% in 2025 compared with 2024. The stock trades at an above-market 32 times earnings, but that's in line with its 10-year historical P/E.\n\nXylem\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will provide $50 billion to improve our nation's drinking water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. It's the single largest investment in water the government has ever made, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Xylem (XYL), a global water technology company, is primed to benefit because it makes equipment for water transport, treatment, testing and use.\n\nSupply-chain bottlenecks have been a hurdle for Xylem of late, but its high-tech products, such as its smart water meters, have been in big demand, says CFRA Research analyst Jonathan Sakraida , who rates the stock a Strong Buy. When all the numbers are in, he expects them to show revenues jumped 16% in 2024 compared with 2023. That's ahead of the firm's five-year historical revenue growth rate of 12%.\n\n\"Xylem is benefiting from the digital transformation of the water business, with accelerating industry adoption of digital solutions,\" Sakraida says. Another boost will come from updated regulations on forever chemicals and other contaminants in drinking water.\n\nWe appreciate Xylem's environmental stewardship, and the stock has earned a place in the Kiplinger ESG 20 , the list of our favorite stocks and funds with an environmental, social or corporate governance focus. But this pure-play water in-frastructure company deserves mention in a list of infrastructure beneficiaries, too.\n\nEven so, the stock has been a bit \"underappreciated\" in recent months, says Sakraida, as investors realized that the allocation of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds would be more of a \"slow burn\" than \"explosive\" to the water company's sales and earnings growth.\n\nShares have climbed just 12% since the start of 2024. But that means they're a relative bargain. Xylem stock trades at 27 times expected earnings \u2013 well below the stock's five-year median P/E of 34, according to Zacks. Analysts expect annualized earnings growth of 13% over the next three years, or a tad better than the 12% growth rate logged over the past five years.\n\nThe best infrastructure funds to buy\n\nInvesting in individual stocks can be rewarding, but some investors may prefer to diffuse the risk by investing in several companies via a focused infrastructure fund. Here are our favorites.\n\nGlobal X U.S. Infrastructure Development (PAVE) is an exchange-traded fund that offers broad exposure to companies involved in \"the nuts-and-bolts buildout of bridges and roads, as well as to companies that play a role in electric-grid enhancements and even companies that rent out equipment,\" says chief investment officer of BMO Wealth Management Yung-Yu Ma.\n\nThe index fund boasts a robust, 22.1% annualized return over the past five years \u2013 the top return of all infrastructure funds. Trane Technologies (TT), Parker Hannifin (PH) and Eaton are the fund's top holdings. It charges a 0.47% expense ratio.\n\nInvesco Building & Construction ETF (PKB) holds only building and construction companies, as its name implies, and fund-tracker Morningstar classifies it as an industrials sector fund. Compared with Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development, its portfolio is more concentrated (30 stocks), and it charges a higher expense ratio (0.57%). But its five-year annualized return of 21.1% beat 93% of its industrial-fund peers.\n\nOne-third of the portfolio is devoted to homebuilder stocks, including Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR) and PulteGroup (PHM), which Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development doesn't own. Even so, the two ETFs share some of the same top holdings, including Trane Technologies, Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Argan (AGX).\n\nWe have our eye on Fidelity Infrastructure ( FNSTX ), though the fund is relatively new; it launched in November 2019. The 48-stock portfolio includes a slug of industrials (Waste Connections (WCN), Norfolk Southern (NSC)), utilities (NextEra Energy (NEE), Southern (SO)), real estate firms (American Tower (AMT)) and energy stocks (Williams Companies (WMB), Targa Resources (TRGP)).\n\nBut the fund's global focus \u2013 23% of assets are invested in foreign stocks \u2013 has been a drag. Over the past five years, Fidelity Infrastructure has delivered a 9.1% annualized return. That was not as remunerative as some of the other funds mentioned here, but it beat the typical infrastructure fund. The fund's expense ratio is 0.95%.\n\nOther industrials sector funds to consider include THE Fidelity MSCI Industrials ETF (FIDU); the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI); and the Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS). All boast low fees and five-year annualized returns of better than 13%.\n\nFinally, though Fidelity Select Industrials ( FCYIX ) manager David Wagner is relatively new, the fund has returned a cumulative 49.6% since he took over in mid-2023 \u2013 better than the 36.8% gain in the S&P 500 Industrials Sector index over the same period. The fund charges 0.69% annually.\n\nHow Trump could impact infrastructure spending\n\nGenerally, most market watchers expect infrastructure spending to continue apace under President Trump. \"Historically, spending money on roads, public works, airports, ports and harbors, and various parks has been something that Democrats and Republicans agree on,\" says Bruce Kennedy, manager of DF Dent Midcap Growth fund. \"Representatives like to go back home for a ribbon cutting.\"\n\nIndeed, changes to any of the three major infrastructure acts \u2013 the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both passed in 2022) \u2013 will likely be line by line, not a wholesale repeal, says Jake Schurmeier , a Harbor Capital manager of multi-asset portfolios. \"Trump is a populist, and 60% of the spending under these acts goes to Republican states, so it isn't in his interest to cut back on spending,\" he adds.\n\nThe $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act passed with a lot of bipartisan support, too. \"I expect by and large that will be untouched,\" says Schurmeier. About $55 billion has been spent, with Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung having received some of the funds.\n\nMost at risk are the environmental tax credits in the $400 billion Inflation Reduction Act. Even so, Republicans will likely \"take a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,\" to the IRA, says John Duncan , a principal with the Meridian Research Group, which provides insight on public policy to investors and corporations. Among the credits likely to go on the chopping block is the $7,500 credit for buyers of new electric vehicles , as well as tax credits for companies that generate clean power (solar, wind) or that develop clean energy technologies.\n\nFinally, Trump's America-first agenda means his administration \"has a clear interest in building out America and building up America,\" says Bob Robotti , founder of Robotti & Company Advisors. Whatever your politics, that bodes well for infrastructure spending and the stocks that will benefit from it.\n\nNote: This item first appeared in Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, a monthly, trustworthy source of advice and guidance.

            "content": "Summary and Key Points: Poland is considering acquiring the F-15EX Eagle II to strengthen its defense against Russia, but no decision or timeline has been finalized. At the MSPO defense expo, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric pitched their engines for a potential Polish Eagle II fleet.\n\n-Pratt & Whitney has a longstanding presence in Poland and produces F100 engines locally, but GE\u2019s F110 currently powers the F-15EX. While the advanced fighter would bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank, its deployment to Poland could provoke Russia.\n\n-Poland is also evaluating the Eurofighter Typhoon, making the decision more complex. The F-15EX would enhance Warsaw\u2019s defense capabilities significantly.\n\nPoland\u2019s beef with Russia goes way back, and the Poles are always looking to improve their military, especially since Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces invaded Ukraine. Now that the F-15EX Eagle II is making its way to U.S. Air National Guard units in America, the Poles have a new item on their wish list.\n\nThe F-15EX would be an excellent addition to the Polish fighter fleet. However, there has been no final decision or timeline for the acquisition, and the Poles have been pining after the Eagle II for over a year.\n\nDefense Expo in Poland Has Defense Sales Forces Buzzing\n\nThere has been one new development. On September 4, people flocked to this year\u2019s MSPO defense cooperation conference and exhibition in Kielce, Poland, to get a taste of the products of significant defense contractors worldwide.\n\nLast year\u2019s MSPO saw Boeing making a pitch to the Polish government for the F-15EX. The Poles were intrigued.\n\nEngine Makers Are Competing for Polish Attention\n\nNow, F-15EX subcontractors are getting in on the action. I\u2019m talking about Pratt & Whitney and General Electric vying to be the engine supplier to any F-15EX sold to Poland. Pratt & Whitney\u2019s F100 engine is one choice to power the Eagle II and GE Aerospace\u2019s F110-GE-129 engine is the other.\n\nPratt & Whitney is a subsidiary of RTX (formerly Raytheon). The defense behemoth has a significant presence in Poland which could give it the upper hand in the competition for Warsaw\u2019s money. The company has operated in Poland for 48 years and has 6,200 employees.\n\nPratt & Whitney\u2019s F100 engines that power Poland\u2019s F-16s are also made in the country.\n\nWill the F-15EX Swap Out GE Engines for Pratt & Whitney?\n\nHowever, the F-15EX has already made its first flight with GE engines. Pratt & Whitney does not think this is a problem.\n\nJosh Goodman, senior program director for the F100 program at Pratt & Whitney, told journalists at MSPO in Poland that the F100 is a viable option for the F-15EX. Goodman said while the F100 is not currently certified for the F-15EX, it would \u201cnot need to go through the whole process of integration and certification\u201d should it be chosen. \u201cThere is a very limited, low risk integration and certification scope that the engine would have to go through in conjunction with the airframe in order to properly certify for use on the F-15EX airframe,\u201d he said.\n\nNot So Fast on the F-15EX\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but there is yet to be an official transfer of the F-15EX to Poland. Boeing would love it, but the U.S. government may not be ready to send such an advanced fighter to a NATO ally that lives on the border with Russia. Putin would see it as a major provocative and audacious move.\n\nPoland is also looking at the Eurofighter Typhoon for purchase. So, for Pratt & Whitney to have its way with their engines, the stars would have to align.\n\nEagle II Flies High\n\nBut the F-15EX would be a great choice for Poland. It is an all-weather multi-role strike fighter. It has a large payload, excellent range, and impressive speed. The latest radars and sensors give it enviable situational awareness. It works great as a stand-off missile launch platform, but it can also give adversaries nightmares in dogfights.\n\nThe F-15EX would fit in better with NATO, too, since the original F-15 airframe has been flying since the 1970s.\n\nLet\u2019s Wait and See\n\nIt may be premature for Pratt & Whitney to try and become the engine supplier if Poland buys the F-15EX, but give it credit for trying. Today\u2019s threat environment in Europe is dangerous and NATO countries are scrambling to get a leg up on the Russians. American defense contractors aim to gain more sales and market share as a result.\n\nThe F-15EX is a stellar fighter and would look good flying under Polish colors. We will see if Boeing can convince the Poles that this airplane is a winner and whether GE or Pratt & Whitney provide the engines. Either way, Putin would have a fit if the Eagle II makes its way to Warsaw.\n\nAbout the Author: Dr. Brent M. Eastwood\n\nBrent M.

            "content": "According to a Bloomberg report, advisers to President-elect Donald Trump are proposing a two-pronged strategy to reshape the U.S. auto industry. The plan includes cutting federal subsidies for EVs while fostering a domestic supply chain for their production. This approach aims to prioritize U.S. automakers without taxpayer support for consumers. Recommendations also include easing environmental reviews, speeding up permits for EV projects, and expanding tariffs on EV-related imports.\n\nHowever, intense competition and oversupply in the domestic market could lead to consolidation among Chinese manufacturers. The market is anticipated to face challenges in 2025 due to policy changes, but strong growth is expected to resume later in the decade.\n\nChina is set to lead global EV sales, with domestic EV sales expected to exceed 12 million units by 2025, a 20% increase from the previous year, as reported by the Financial Times. This growth comes as traditional car sales are expected to decline by over 10%. China's EV success is attributed to advancements in technology and resource supply chains, lowering manufacturing costs. While EV growth has slowed in Europe and the U.S., China\u2019s market continues to expand rapidly, overtaking Western competitors.\n\nMeanwhile, China's vehicle market is expected to see continued growth, especially in new energy vehicles, supported by incentives and subsidies. Global production is forecast to decline by 0.4%, with regional variations. Electric vehicles are still a growth sector, with battery electric vehicle sales projected to reach 15.1 million units, a 30% increase from 2024, the report states. However, uncertainties regarding infrastructure, policies, and supply chains persist.\n\nAccording to the S&P Global Mobility report, global vehicle sales in 2025 are expected to reach 89.6 million units, growing 1.7% from 2024. However, several challenges, including high interest rates, economic uncertainty, and evolving electrification policies, are likely to limit growth. In the US, the incoming administration's policies, including tariffs and deregulation, could further complicate the market. The European market is projected to grow modestly due to economic risks and stricter emission rules.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Biggest EV Stocks In the World Heading into 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) stands against the other EV stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoreover, federal incentives like the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers would be repealed, and fuel economy and tailpipe pollution regulations would return to 2019 levels. The proposals also seek to support domestic manufacturing, including EV battery production, the report states. Additionally, the transition team is considering deregulating the autonomous vehicle industry and easing reporting requirements for carmakers using automated driving technologies.\n\nPotential U.S. Tariffs Could Undermine Canada-U.S. Automotive Trade\n\nThere are growing concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports could harm the recovering Canadian auto industry, especially in Ontario, where major automakers produce vehicles largely for U.S. consumers, as per CNBC.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford warned that such tariffs could increase vehicle prices, slow production, and cost jobs in both Canada and the U.S. Trump's tariffs, intended to address national security concerns, could add significant costs to vehicles and automotive parts from Canada, Mexico, and China. The report states that while Canada's auto exports to the U.S. are substantial, industry leaders fear the tariffs could disrupt this balance, negatively impacting both sides. Ontario Premier called for closer collaboration between Canada and the U.S. rather than imposing tariffs on their closest ally.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we created a list of the largest auto manufacturers in the world that manufacture and sell EVs. We then narrowed our list to 12 stocks with the biggest market cap and were traded on either the NYSE, NASDAQ, or OTC markets. The 12 biggest EV stocks in the world are listed in ascending order of their market cap.

            "content": "Jeff Teel was just getting his email set up this morning when CCCNews gave him a ring at his new office on River Road in The Dalles.\n\nTeel, 48, currently of Eugene, will function as the new Chief Operating Officer at Northern Wasco County PUD.\n\n\u201cMy strongest expertise is in technology,\u201d Teel said. \u201cMy focus right now is to get to know the people here and understand what their needs are.\u201d\n\nTeel\u2019s title also includes Director of Engineering, Operations & Technology.\n\nIn his first several months, Teel said he will be wrapping his mind around upcoming projects and getting a working knowledge of the budget.\n\nThe PUD and Teel face large challenges as the customer-owned utility continues to provide local residents with inexpensive electricity in an ever-changing environment of power policy.\n\nIn 2018, PUD General Manager Roger Kline said the PUD served \u201cjust over 10,200 meters with a new system peak just experienced earlier this August (2018) of 121 MW. That isn\u2019t huge by any means, but for a historically winter-peaking utility, this is a change. Our largest build-outs are in the data-technology space, with expected loads in the next five-year planning horizon greater than 500 MW.\u201d\n\nOur annual budget is just over $42 million in 2018 and our current asset value is just under $100 million. I should note we do have a 10-year capital investment plan of just over $37 million and have completed our first new substation build in well over 20 years, with another starting next year,\u201d Kline said.\n\nThe PUD\u2019s power generation portfolio is comprised of the following sources:\n\n\u2022 Hydroelectric \u2013 90.7% (baseload)\n\n\u2022 Wind, solar, biomass & natural gas 1.2% (intermittent)\n\n\u2022 Nuclear 6.1% (baseload)\n\n\u2022 Market Purchases 2.1 % (as needed)\n\nThe public utility owns hydro-electric turbines at McNary and The Dalles dams.\n\nTeel said he was excited to be moving east.\n\nHe enjoys touring on his Yamaha FJR 1300 motorcycle and looked forward to the vistas and gorgeous highways the Gorge and Central Oregon have to offer. \u201cI like the power and the sound,\u201d he said of the bike. \u201cI ride responsibly.\u201d\n\nHe also enjoys the outdoors.\n\n\u201cWe want to get out of the Willamette Valley and get more sunshine and less rain and fewer people.\u201d\n\nTeel is married to his wife Lisa and has two grown children. He said he and his wife will be working toward selling their home in Eugene and making a permanent move to The Dalles in months to come.\n\nTeel comes to us from OS Engineering where he served as Control Systems Engineer & Manager, in Springfield, Oregon.\n\nThe company website touts itself as, \u201cLeading the industry in best-value power distribution system design, analysis, testing and commissioning, our team can support the electrical and controls engineering needs of power generation customers from small owner/operator power plants to the largest power providers.\u201d\n\nTeel has had a very successful career in public power, consulting engineering as well as the industrial technology sector,\u201d said Lili Garcia in a PUD press release. \u201cHe also served in the United States Navy and is a graduate of their Nuclear Power Program. Please join me in welcoming Jeff to our wonderful community.\u201d\n\nHere is the rest of his employment history.\n\nStaff Electrical Engineer\n\nEugene Water & Electric Board\n\n2006-2013\n\nFacilities Controls Engineer\n\nSK Hynix\n\n2003-2006\n\nField Engineer\n\nGeneral Electric\n\n1998-2003\n\nElectrician's Mate\n\nUnited States Navy\n\n1992-1998\n\nWithin its strategic plan, the PUD will consider the potential impacts of climate change and the need for resilient infrastructure investments; while considering the various outlooks of its customer-owners regarding this issue.\n\nThe utility is also guarding against big rate swings in power costs via the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, where most of its power is purchased.\n\nNWCPUD is an active participant in trade associations, such as the American Public Power Association (APPA) www.publicpower.org , the Public Power Council (PPC) www.ppcpdx.org , the Northwest Public Power Association (NWPPA) www.nwppa.org, and the Oregon People\u2019s Utility District Association (OPUDA) www.opuda.org.

The three-day talks on defense industry cooperation began on December 24 in \u0130stanbul.\n\nSaudi Arabian Chief of Staff Gen. Feyyaz bin Hamid er-Ruveyli also had talks with Turkish defense officials in Ankara on December 26.\n\nTurkish Defense Minister Ya\u015far G\u00fcler and Chief of General Staff Gen. Metin G\u00fcrak discussed defense projects including fighter jets, warships, radar systems and missiles with er-Ruveyli, defense officials said.\n\nThe procurement discussions concerning the 100 Kaan fighter jets were reportedly one of the key subjects of the meetings.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Kaan fighter jet project, initiated in 2016, aims to produce a next-generation aircraft by the late 2020s.\n\nThe $1.18 billion project includes collaboration with BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce for engine development, according to the SSB.\n\nSaudi Arabia seeks to upgrade its combat air fleet amid regional tensions. The kingdom has traditionally relied on US-made F-15 fighters for its defense needs and has been unable to acquire the US-made F-35 fifth generation fighter jet, despite repeated requests since 2012.\n\nIn the wake of such restrictions, Saudi Arabia is now exploring options with other international partners. The choice is between the French Rafale, Turkey\u2019s Kaan fighter jet and China\u2019s J-31 stealth fighter, similar to the F-35.\n\nRiyadh wants an agreement that would include clauses for technology transfer and local production.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Kaan fighter project will test a second prototype in 2025, according to G\u00f6rg\u00fcn.\n\nThe fighter jets will initially use General Electric F110 engines before switching to locally produced ones, officials said. US export licenses would be required for the sale of F110-powered aircraft.\n\nThe basic problem of the entire Turkish defense industry is that it is dependent on foreign engines. Most of its aviation projects, such as the Kaan, depend on General Electric\u2019s F110 engines, which are susceptible to possible US sanctions that will disrupt production and exports.\n\nThe same happened when the US vetoed Ankara\u2019s sale of T-129 attack helicopters to Pakistan because export licenses for the US-made engines were denied. Despite this, Turkey did manage to deliver six T-129s to the Philippines, with an option for six more, perhaps helped by improved US-Philippine relations.\n\nAlthough the Saudis are interested in buying the Turkish Kaan fighter jet, it is too early to assume such a sale will eventually take place.\n\nAs the Kaan program develops and more information becomes available, clarity on the probability and scale of any potential deal is expected to emerge.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Turkey and Saudi Arabia signed a deal for the purchase of drones manufactured by Turkey\u2019s leading drone maker Baykar.\n\nHaluk Bayraktar, CEO of Baykar, which is co-run by one of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sons-in-laws, at the time called the deal \u201cthe biggest defense and aviation export contract in the history of the Turkish Republic.\u201d\n\nThe value of the deal was not made public.",
