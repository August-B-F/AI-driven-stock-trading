            "content": "Home Depot\u2019s 12-foot yard skeleton, better known as Skelly, is easily the internet\u2019s favorite Halloween decoration. For 2025, The Home Depot is adding to the Skelly collection with Skelly Ultra, a smaller but tech-packed version that I already know is going to be spooky season\u2019s must-have decoration.\n\nI got an early look at Skelly Ultra at The Home Depot\u2019s Store Managers Meeting (SMM), the company\u2019s annual conference where some upcoming products are previewed, primarily for internal purposes. The show floor had a staged space celebrating the halfway mark to Halloween, with this new spin on Skelly front-and-center.\n\nAt 6.5 feet, Skelly Ultra isn\u2019t going to tower over your house like its comically-large $300 counterpart, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in animatronics.\n\nThe Home Depot turned this Skelly into a fully interactive experience complete with moving arms, LED lighting, a Bluetooth speaker, and support for app-controlled interactions.\n\nSkelly Ultra comes with five preset recordings and the ability to create up to 30-second custom recordings through the compatible app. Whether you want it to bark menacingly at kids or crack terrible, yet Halloween-appropriate dad jokes, the choice is yours.\n\nSince you can stream music through Skelly Ultra\u2019s built-in speaker, I would personally dress it up as a creepy DJ for my front yard to blast all the best Halloween hits.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Halloween that Skelly Ultra is good for. One of the best things of the original Skelly (which, I\u2019ll clarify is also returning for 2025) is the recessed LCD LifeEyes that squint and blink. Skelly Ultra continues LifeEyes, including seasonal eye themes such as birthday confetti, St. Patrick\u2019s Day clovers, dragons, and even the American flag.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

I fully expect to see Skelly Ultra in Santa hats, 4th of July sunglasses, and maybe even a leprechaun outfit across social media once it\u2019s out.\n\nThe Home Depot hasn\u2019t revealed pricing or availability for Skelly Ultra yet, but given how hard it is to get your hands on the OG Skelly, this new one is probably going to sell out fast. Even with all the added features, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll be priced lower than the 12-foot version, maybe in the $150-$200 ballpark.\n\nBesides being more affordable, Skelly Ultra is way more practical for more people given its reasonable height. Plus, it's a fun way to make Halloween setups of any size feel less static and more interactive.\n\nSo if you love Halloween and take your decor planning seriously, keep an eye out for more information on when Skelly Ultra will hit stores.",

To me, this is when you keep the faith,\" adding that investors should buy more if the stock drops.\n\nCramer pointed out that the company seems to be doing well, even though the stock is down from its highs. He suggested that the potential rise of electric-powered outdoor appliances could lead to a replacement cycle, which would be good for the company's business.\n\nCramer also interviewed Home Depot CEO Ted Decker at the company's annual store managers meeting in Las Vegas. Decker brushed off concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff hikes would hurt business. He said the company already adjusted to increased taxes on imports in 2017, and he affirmed that whatever happens, \"we're going to work through it.\" Decker added that the big box retailer is focused on value. It wants to sell products and \"move volume\" \u2013 both to customers and wholesalers \u2013 rather than \"milk margin.\"\n\nDecker also remarked on homebuilding, and said the country is \"anywhere between two and five million housing units short of demand.\" Because there's less building, he argued, homes are aging more than they normally would.\n\n\"Well over half the houses in this country are now over 40 years old,\" Decker said. \"So, the amount of work and upkeep you need to make on those houses, they've gained in value, but they need a lot of work. And we're the place to go to help people do that.\"",

To calculate this metric for Home Depot, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.32 = US$22b \u00f7 (US$96b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2025).\n\nSo, Home Depot has an ROCE of 32%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%.\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Home Depot's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Home Depot, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 48% where it was five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Home Depot's ROCE\n\nBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Home Depot's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 113% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Home Depot, you might be interested to know about the that our analysis has discovered.\n\nHome Depot is not the only stock earning high returns.

            "content": "IT\u2019S10 a.m. on a Tuesday and Tova Brody is sitting in the living room with her two oldest daughters giving them a homeschool writing lesson.\n\n\u201cWould this be an example of a metaphor?\u201d asks Toby, age 13. She\u2019s analyzing the lyrics to her favorite Jewish song \u2014 Moshe Yess\u2019s \u201cDollar Bill\u201d \u2014 and identifying all the elements of figurative language she can find in it.\n\n\u201cYes! This is a perfect example!\u201d Tova tells her daughter. \u201cDo you see any others?\u201d\n\nEleven-year-old Tillie is working on a \u201cpersuasive writing\u201d assignment. \u201cHow do you spell \u2018congressman\u2019?\u201d she asks. She\u2019s writing a letter to her local congressman in Baltimore, Maryland, to campaign for a sidewalk on the Brodys\u2019 street. They live on a main road, so they want sidewalks to make walking in the neighborhood safer. Tillie and her siblings have gone door to door with clipboards, asking their neighbors to sign a petition for more sidewalks, and they created an email blast campaign to their delegates, senators, and the Maryland Transportation Authority. So far, they\u2019ve managed to get more sidewalks in their neighborhood, but there still isn\u2019t one on their block. Tillie\u2019s hoping to change that with her letter.\n\nWith the older girls engaged in their writing lesson, Tova can zoom her lens back to her baby, Shalva, who is on the floor pulling books off the shelf, and three-year-old Dov, who is happily eating a homemade zucchini muffin. (The Brody kids have a zucchini patch in their backyard, so zucchini muffins are a staple in this house.)\n\nDownstairs, in the basement-turned-classroom, Tova\u2019s nine-year-old Tippy and six-year-old Shifra are learning the 39 Melachos of Shabbos along with six other homeschooled girls who are part of the Baltimore Jewish community. One of the mothers in the Brody\u2019s homeschooling co-op volunteers to teach the six- to nine-year-olds four days a week, while the other mothers take turns teaching different subjects. One mother holds a weekly book club, while another teaches a parshah art club. Other subjects on the agenda are yoga, dance, and drama.\n\n\u201cIn our house, the world is the classroom,\u201d Tova says, \u201cand anything can be an educational opportunity. Baking bread teaches math and chemistry and burning a part of the dough teaches about the halachos of hafrashas challah. When my daughter, Toby, told me she loved a certain face cream, I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you write a letter to the company to thank them and show hakaras hatov?\u2019 The company wrote back and gave her a coupon for her next purchase. That was a lesson that was personally meaningful to her, an experience you can\u2019t get out of a writing assignment from a textbook.\u201d\n\nReal Life Lessons\n\nGrowing up as one of three kids in a Chabad-leaning family on a 72-acre maple syrup farm in Vermont, Tova always knew she wanted to homeschool. \u201cFarm chores were definitely part of growing up,\u201d Tova recalls fondly. \u201cWe would collect sap and boil it into maple syrup, feed the horses, clean out the chicken coop, and collect fresh eggs. I attended a small Lubavitch school that did an amazing job of educating each child according to their way. I was also home for half a year in high school and it allowed me to complete two years of requirements in six months. That experience taught me how much time home education frees up for the fun things in life.\u201d\n\nWhen Tova was dating her future husband, Don, she told him that she intended to homeschool and he was completely on board. \u201cHe was homeschooled himself for many years,\u201d Tova tells me. \u201cHis mother had initially sent her boys to typical schools, but it just wasn\u2019t a good fit. The schools were very cookie-cutter, and her kids didn\u2019t fit the mold.\u201d\n\nToday, Don is very hands-on with his children\u2019s chinuch. \u201cHe has a property management and pest-control business, and he always tries to include the kids in his work projects,\u201d Tova explains. \u201cThey help him with landscaping \u2014 planting trees, laying down mulch. Whenever Don has to test the chlorine in our pool, he has the kids measure PH and chlorine levels, a real-life chemistry lesson.\u201d\n\nWhen Don wanted to build a porch on the house, he asked the kids if they wanted to help. \u201cTillie was his only volunteer,\u201d Tova says with a laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s my outdoorsy one and she tends to be his partner in crime in all his construction projects.\u201d After helping her father with the measurements, Tillie learned how to shop for what they needed at Home Depot. She unloaded the beams from the car, and under Don\u2019s supervision she drilled, hammered, and sawed.\n\n\u201cIn our house, we don\u2019t say to our kids, \u2018You can\u2019t use real tools,\u2019 \u201d Tova says. \u201cWe say, \u2018Let\u2019s teach you how to use them properly.\u2019 Obviously, we keep them safe, but we don\u2019t believe in sheltering them and being totally risk averse.\u201d\n\nLearning how to be a self-sufficient adult is a big part of the Brody\u2019s unofficial curriculum. \u201cI\u2019ll give the kids the challenge of figuring out a meal from start to finish,\u201d Tova says. \u201cThey\u2019ll do everything \u2014 create a shopping list, pick out the groceries, pay at checkout, and cook the meal. I\u2019ll sometimes wait outside the grocery stores to give the girls a chance to shop without me there. They\u2019re learning everything it takes to run a household.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also passionate about making sure our kids are financially literate,\u201d Tova adds, \u201cso we give the kids an allowance for doing things above and beyond their chores, such as babysitting a certain number of times, or clearing the yard of sticks and rocks. We give them their allowance in the form of a paycheck, which they receive every other week. The kids help us do the math of deducting taxes and maaser from their paychecks. At the end of the summer, the kids vote on what we should do with their tax money, so they learn about representative government. They also get to decide where they want their maaser to go. They\u2019re learning about the importance of tzedakah, and how to choose a charity that\u2019s meaningful to them.\u201d\n\nMany people associate learning with a classroom, but for the Brodys, learning is simply how you live. \u201cIf my kids ask me a question, and I don\u2019t know the answer, I educate myself about it. I\u2019m constantly learning. Toby wanted to learn the violin, but I had never touched a string instrument before, so I told her, \u2018We\u2019ll learn it together.\u2019 That said, if there\u2019s something I can\u2019t teach, I\u2019ll take my kids to people who can teach them.\u201d\n\nFor kodesh studies, for example, the older girls are enrolled in Jewish Online School, a homeschooling program that runs four days a week for two hours a day (see sidebar for more). \u201cThe girls love it. They\u2019re learning Chumash, Navi, Halachah, Parshah. It\u2019s very project-based \u2014Toby is currently making a comic strip of Melachim because that\u2019s how she learns best. She loves graphic design and she\u2019s learning Navi in a way that resonates with her. The teachers are amazing.\u201d\n\nHome Education Not Homeschool\n\nLiving in Baltimore, there are plenty of Torah day schools to choose from, but for the Brodys, homeschool is an active choice. Tova actually prefers the term \u201chome education\u201d because, as she points out, she\u2019s not just doing school at home, she\u2019s educating, and that has a very different look and feel from school.\n\n\u201cHome educating allows for the family unit to be the focal point of childhood. The Jewish home is the main base and with that, family values are the priority,\u201d Tova explains. \u201cSchools don\u2019t leave a lot of time for your child to be in the family unit. Even at the best schools, children spend more time with their teachers than their family.\u201d\n\nAs a \u201chome educating\u201d mother, Tova takes advantages of opportunities to pass down and involve her children in what\u2019s important to her: midwifery and political advocacy. Tova is a trained homebirth midwife with her own private practice. \u201cJuggling both jobs can be a challenge,\u201d Tova admits, \u201cbut I own my own practice, so I try to schedule all my patients for Sunday and keep my practice low-volume.\u201d When she\u2019s not busy with that, she\u2019s actively involved in local government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting with my lobbyist this week and going down to Annapolis in a month to advocate for midwifery bills and increased maternal healthcare safety. Of course, I\u2019ll bring my kids with me. They come with me to Annapolis every year. I want my children to get involved in local government and understand the power of voicing concerns to your elected officials.\u201d\n\nChesed and volunteerism isn\u2019t something the Brodys just talk about; it\u2019s a value they try to integrate into their everyday life. \u201cDon has coordinated street cleanups with the county where they pick up garbage on streets or hiking trails. We tell the kids, \u2018Wherever you go, bring a plastic bag and collect some trash. Let\u2019s try to leave every place a little nicer than we found it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Brody kids regularly visit assisted living and nursing homes where they play the violin, sing, and play piano for the elderly. \u201cToby volunteers at the Chabad House, helping with events, and my kids help the rebbetzin in the kitchen every Shabbos to set up the kiddush,\u201d Tova adds.\n\nThe Brodys follow a homeschooling method called \u201cunschooling,\u201d a term coined by educator John Holt in the 1970s. The belief behind unschooling is that children are naturally curious, and they learn best when they\u2019re interested in a topic. Children decide what they want to learn, how they want to learn it, and at what pace. The focus is on the child\u2019s interests and learning style.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of home education is that it allows children to learn through play and experience,\u201d Tova explains. \u201cKids get to run around in the fresh air. They get to learn what they\u2019re passionate about. They get to learn at their own pace. If a child excels at math and needs more time and support in reading, it gives them the space to be where they are and get extra support where they need it.\u201d\n\nBeyond the benefits of homeschool, Tova is also trying to protect her kids from the pitfalls of typical school. \u201cI have no judgment toward people who choose to send their kids to mainstream yeshivahs, but there are potential flaws in the system. Sometimes, you hear of a school diagnosing a normal, active child with ADHD and putting them on medication because the school can\u2019t handle a kid who needs to move around a bit more. Other times, there are issues with bullying, or toxic values that creep in from social media or iPhones. Sometimes, your child has a mediocre or subpar teacher \u2014 that\u2019s ten months of their formative childhood with a teacher who may not be good for them.\u201d\n\nTova sees homeschooling as a natural extension of her midwife philosophy. \u201cProfessionally, my entire philosophy is based on informed consent. In the medical community, you\u2019ll walk into a doctor\u2019s office at twenty-eight weeks pregnant and they\u2019ll say something like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be doing a gestational diabetes test today. Drink this glucola drink and we\u2019ll test your blood sugar.\u2019 As a midwife, I would say, \u2018Typically at twenty-eight weeks, we test for gestational diabetes. These are the risks of the test, these are the benefits, and these are the alternatives. How do you feel about it?\u2019 I try to raise my children the same way. I want them to feel as if they\u2019re making informed choices about their education.\u201d\n\nWhat if her children one day choose to mainstream into regular frum schools? \u201cI would be fine with that,\u201d says Tova. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m planning to take Toby to tour a few girl\u2019s high schools in the Baltimore area to see if she would be interested in attending. Right now, she\u2019s leaning against it because she sees the sheer amount of time that school takes up. What the kids appreciate about homeschooling is the flexibility, and that it allows them to prioritize their hobbies. Toby has expressed interest in enrolling in online college classes starting in tenth or eleventh grade, and graduating high school with an associate\u2019s degree at the same time. I expect that the girls will go to some kind of seminary after high school. I\u2019d be happy if they want to go to college, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a requirement to being successful in life.\u201d\n\nWhat about more in-depth yeshivah learning for her son? \u201cHe\u2019s only three right now,\u201d Tova says, \u201cso it\u2019s a while away, but my husband and I have thought about enrolling him in yeshivah at nine or ten so he can learn Gemara with other boys.\u201d\n\nIt Takes a Village\n\nBetween homeschooling all her kids and running a private practice, how exactly does Tova have time to pull off supper every night, wash the laundry, shop, run the home, make Shabbos, and somehow also prepare for Pesach?\n\nThe short answer: With help. Lots of it.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s Tova\u2019s mother-in-law, who lives in an attached apartment. \u201cUntil a few decades ago, it was normal for children to be raised in a multigenerational culture. For me, raising children this way is just how it was meant to be. According to the Torah, there\u2019s so much mesorah that\u2019s passed down from generation to generation. My mother-in-law bakes challah every week, and the kids go down and help her. She also teaches sewing \u2014 they\u2019re learning how to make clothing, hats, bags, quilts. They\u2019re getting an opportunity to learn from the matriarch of the family.\u201d\n\nTova\u2019s parents also live nearby. \u201cMy mother ran a veterinary pharmaceutical company and worked in animal hospitals for many years, so she helps the girls foster kittens. My girls have fostered around forty kittens, nursing them back to health, and finding homes for them.\u201d Tova\u2019s father is a rabbi, attorney, and musician. Both her parents board horses at a stable, and her father gives the kids horseback riding lessons.\n\nWho watches the kids when Tova needs to rush out to deliver a baby? \u201cWe have a sitter who is like another Brody sister in our family,\u201d Tova shares. \u201cI can also call my mother or mother-in-law, and baruch Hashem there are so many other incredible sisters-in-law and friends and neighbors who offer to swoop in whenever I need.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t just help with babysitting. Last year, Tova gave birth on Taanis Esther, so she had to prepare for Pesach with a newborn and five kids at home. Tova\u2019s sister-in-law sent over her four teenage nieces to help her clean.\n\nWith six kids at home now, Tova keeps her expectations realistic. \u201cWe\u2019re not a toothpick-to-the-floorboards family,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I don\u2019t clean months in advance because I know at some point my kids will bring in bagels, pretzels, and pizza. We try to clean a few weeks before Pesach and, after that, we only buy kitniyos, not chametz gamur, before we do our final clean. Everyone in the family has a job and helps.\n\n\u201cWhile I know of homeschool families who live on farms in the middle of nowhere, for me, as an extroverted person, being part of a community is what makes it enjoyable,\u201d Tova says. One night a year, toward the end of August, 20 homeschooling mothers with school-age kids from five to 18 get together for \u201chomeschooling mother planning night\u201d to create the homeschooling schedule for the upcoming year.\n\n\u201cWe sit down for hours and decide what classes we\u2019re going to offer, and which mothers are going to teach what. One year I offered an art class. Another year, a movement class. Whatever talents or knowledge we have, we offer to teach.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the homeschool co-op classes, there are weekly field trips to parks, museums, roller skating rinks, and more for the greater Jewish homeschooling community. \u201cWe always hold events around chagim,\u201d Tova adds. \u201cThe girls usually get together every year to put on a Purim play. One homeschool mother holds a Tishrei fair in her basement. This year, I had the kids making focaccia bread in the shape of a lulav and esrog at my table, one mother made Succah decorations at her table, while another mother was teaching about the Yom Kippur machzor.\u201d\n\nBaltimore has a sizeable frum homeschool community \u2014 Tova knows of a hundred families in her homeschooling network \u2014 and the families are committed to making homeschooling a great experience for their kids. \u201cWe organized the girls\u2019 home education class under an umbrella called Bnos Rena to honor the memory of our dear friend, Rena Baron a\u201dh, a fellow homeschool mother who tragically lost her years-long battle to cancer this past summer,\u201d Tova shares. \u201cOne of the mothers designed a Bnos Rena logo and the girls all have school sweatshirts. It\u2019s important for them to have that cohesive feel of belonging that kids often get from being part of a traditional school.\u201d\n\nShifting Expectations\n\nHow exactly does Tova handle having her kids around 24-7? To start, she\u2019s a big believer in giving kids chores and responsibilities and encouraging them to be independent. So her kids aren\u2019t hanging on her all day. The older girls help with laundry, grocery shopping, meal prep, and baby care. Even her six-year-old and nine-year-old make themselves lunch every day.\n\n\u201cWhen I feel I need to reset, I put myself in a time-out,\u201d says Tova. \u201cIt\u2019s okay for kids to be bored and it\u2019s not my job to entertain them, so sometimes I say, \u2018Everyone go outside and play for a bit.\u2019 Or I let the kids know that I\u2019m going to my room, and I want to be left alone for fifteen minutes.\u201d\n\nTova also prioritizes self-care. \u201cI make sure to do things that fill my cup. My husband and I have a date night once a week. Once a month, I go out to a book club with my friends. Occasionally, I\u2019ll get a massage or read a book, and I absolutely love thrifting. Going to a thrift store, even with my kids, is self-care for me.\u201d\n\nEven though Tova\u2019s educational style is very child-led, there are mornings when Tova must pull off the kids\u2019 blankets and prod them downstairs to learn. Sometimes the kids aren\u2019t in the mood to learn, but the lessons are generally short, and Tova says it really helps to set expectations. \u201cFor the next thirty minutes, we\u2019ll be doing math and then you can do something you\u2019re interested in,\u201d Tova will tell them.\n\nSome days, the kids are cranky, but \u201cI\u2019d rather they have a bad day at home than unload on teachers in a school setting,\u201d Tova says. She\u2019s a big believer in the power of baths to calm kids. Even if it\u2019s in the middle of the day, Tova sometimes draws a bath with Epsom salt, essential oils, and scented candles. \u201cIt\u2019s a great sensory experience. And it\u2019s very detoxing. In general, I believe that physical or sensory experiences can help soothe a child who\u2019s feeling out of sorts.\u201d\n\nHomeschooling, says Tova, changes your perspective about what a home is supposed to be. \u201cMy friend, who just joined the homeschooling co-op, said something that resonated with me: \u2018When you commit to home education,\u2019 she told me, \u2018your expectations shift. Your house might not look the way it did when you sent your kids to school. It might not be the same level of clean or quiet that it was when your kids were gone eight hours a day. But eventually, you realize that it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to accept society\u2019s standard of what your home should look like.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOf all her homeschooling responsibilities, which is the most taxing? \u201cThere are like four thousand carpools every day,\u201d Tova jokes. \u201cI have to drop off one kid at nine fifteen, one at ten, pick up one at ten forty-five, pick up another at eleven, then drop off another one at twelve. It\u2019s stressful having to leave the house fifty times a day, but my homeschool neighbor and I made a pact that this year we\u2019re going to approach carpools with no stress, and just surrender.\n\n\u201cMy biggest parenting hack,\u201d Tova adds, \u201cis to just live in the moment and not worry. I try to not worry about my kids when I\u2019m with a client, and not worry about my clients when I\u2019m with my kids. My goal, and the thing I work on the hardest, is just to live in the present and give one hundred percent of myself to whatever it is that I\u2019m doing at the moment.\u201d\n\nA Day in the Life\n\nBy 12 p.m., Tippy, Shifra, and the other six- to nine-year-olds in their co-op are done with their lessons. The other mothers pick up their children, and Tova\u2019s kids come upstairs. Tova gives them a mini-reading lesson from a workbook and then they have some free play time before lunch.\n\n\u201cThere are always other homeschooling friends and cousins over,\u201d Tova says. \u201cWe call them bonus kids. While they\u2019re here, they become part of the family, even doing chores. I love having all these kids around, but we always send them home for dinner because that\u2019s family-only time.\u201d\n\nFor lunch, the girls make homemade vegetable soup from the vegetables they picked from their garden. \u201cWe grow pretty much everything,\u201d Tova says. \u201cZucchini, potatoes, corn, tomatoes, peas, watermelon, pumpkins, radishes, beets, and carrots. My mother-in-law guides the kids, and the kids do a lot of the planting. Whenever the kids play in the backyard, they come inside with their pockets full of fresh-picked produce. They\u2019ll say, \u2018I want pesto pasta for lunch,\u2019 so they\u2019ll go outside and strip all the basil plants. My kitchen is a constant bustling restaurant for the kids,\u201d Tova jokes. \u201cThey\u2019re always hungry. The food budget blows through the money you save on tuition.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, Tippy and Shifra spend most of the day playing outside, getting a lot of fresh air and exercise, while the older girls often do more schoolwork. \u201cToby is studying Spanish online, and Tillie is taking a class called Weird, Smelly, Sticky Science,\u201d Tova says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s from a homeschooling website called Outschool, and each week they have a different project. One week they discover why skunks smell bad, another week they\u2019ll study ear wax.\u201d In addition to taking science, music, and horseback riding, Tillie is also an assistant teacher at Bas Melech, a local frum girls\u2019 gymnastics and dance gym.\n\nDinner prep is at 5 p.m. and everyone helps. \u201cThe younger kids tidy up, while the older girls might cook, or help with the baby,\u201d Tova explains. \u201cDuring dinner, we do goal setting and celebrating our accomplishments. Toby says she wants to finish reading a series of books by next week. Tillie wants to learn how to canter on her horse. Tippie wants a job as a mother\u2019s helper. Then we talk about all the ways we succeeded at our goals in the past week and celebrate them.\n\n\u201cSo much of our feedback to our children is about what they need to work on \u2014 \u2018Why isn\u2019t your room clean? Why are your shoes in the hall?\u2019 \u2014 so I think it\u2019s so important to pick one accomplishment that you recognize them for every day. Practicing gratitude is a huge part of our life, but also our parenting, and each day we look for things to praise them for, even if it\u2019s just a quick, \u2018Thank you for putting your shoes where they belong.\u2019\n\n\u201cPerhaps for some people, the responsibility of educating one\u2019s own children might be too daunting,\u201d Tova continues. \u201cBut I feel I was given an incredible privilege as my kids\u2019 mother to teach them. In today\u2019s society, we regularly hand control over to people \u2014 whether it\u2019s to the government to educate our children, or to doctors to make our medical decisions for us. If our kids are struggling academically, socially, or emotionally, we blame the school, but if we realize that we are the ones ultimately responsible for our children\u2019s chinuch, then we have the power to change it,\u201d Tova reflects. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very empowering.\u201d\n\nTHE JEWISH DAY SCHOOL EXPERIENCE \u2014 ONLINE\n\nMany homeschoolers rely on web-based Torah learning programs, such as the Jewish Online School. Principal Chanie Hertzel shares the story of her institution.\n\n\u201cW\n\nhen the Jewish Online School (JOS) opened their digital doors in 2010, there were maybe 50 kids. Now we have over 400. Covid changed everything.\n\nBefore the pandemic, people didn\u2019t necessarily realize that there were alternative methods of education. They thought this is the way it is, and that\u2019s it. Then Covid hit, and suddenly parents were open to trying out something different.\n\nWith the tremendous growth of the school in 2020, JOS brought me in as school principal. I have 20 years of experience in teaching, and I was excited to meet the unique challenges of providing the highest caliber Jewish education in a purely digital platform.\n\nJust some background history: Before Jewish Online School, there was Shluchim Online School, a school for children of Lubavitcher shluchim, who are often living in remote locations without access to a yeshivah. Bassie Shemtov, the director, sometimes received calls from parents not involved in shlichus, asking if there were any Jewish online schools available for their children. That\u2019s when she realized there was a need for a top-notch online Jewish school open to any Jewish child, living anywhere in the world.\n\nThere are many Jewish kids around the globe, and there are all sorts of reasons traditional school might not work for them. Some kids might be a little behind and need a slower pace. Other kids might be gifted and need a faster one. Sometimes kids are bullied in school and need a reprieve from daily social or emotional stress. Each child in our school has a unique story about what brought them to us.\n\nThere was a Lakewood family, for example, who joined for a year because the father received a scholarship for a medical fellowship in a city where there was no Jewish community. We have lots of Jewish families in the military whose fathers serve as chaplains. There are also frum families who chose online school because they need to travel regularly for business reasons.\n\nSometimes people come to us because they\u2019re becoming frum. We got a call last year from a rabbi in Maine. A family in his community was getting closer to Yiddishkeit and they wanted something more than just once-a-week Hebrew school for their kids. The Rabbi was nervous to suggest Jewish Online School because he thought it might be too much for them. But the kids decided to join and they loved it. Their mother said to us, \u2018We never knew there was so much to learn!\u2019 They ended up becoming fully frum and moving to a Jewish neighborhood, but they kept the kids in our school because it was such a good fit for them.\n\nSometimes, we get families who are traditional or shomer Shabbos. The parents send their kids to public school due to the high cost of private Jewish day schools, but they want their kids to have a Jewish education \u2014 to know how to say a devar Torah at the Shabbos table, or learn Mishnah. So they send their kids to us after a day of public school.\n\nAll our morahs and rebbis are in it for the kedushah. Many times they work two jobs, at a local frum school and at our online school. We have teachers from all over the world. They do it because they love the students and they want to teach them Torah and give it over to the next generation.\n\nOur students aren\u2019t just watching a screen, they\u2019re getting real hands-on experience. We do challah bakes; we had a program for Shivah Asar B\u2019Tammuz on building the Beis Hamikdash; we have book readings. We design exciting activities so our students can learn while they\u2019re socializing and making friends.\n\nOur school spans the globe. There are children in California logging on at 6 a.m. and children in Europe logging on at 5:30 p.m., but they\u2019re learning the same Torah. It\u2019s all live, on Zoom, with separate classes for boys and girls. There are no prerecorded classes, so they get to see each other and really interact. We always open the class early, and give the kids a recess, so they can socialize and form real friendships online. This past year, we had a bunch of girls from Baltimore and California fly to Texas to stay for a week with friends from JSO. They\u2019re getting the true Jewish Day School experience and making friendships that span the globe.\u201d\n\n(Originally featured in Family First, Issue 936)",

Here are some deals on power drivers and saws from Milwaukee to help you elevate your DIY game.\n\nThe Milwaukee 18-Volt quarter-inch impact driver is on sale for $99, 50% off its usual price. The driver includes a 2-amp-hour battery and a charger as well as a tool bag. This is a great beginner kit, as it comes with an 18-volt battery and compatible charger.\n\nThe Milwaukee 18-volt reciprocating saw is on sale for $149, 52% off its regular price. The reciprocating saw comes with a 5-amp-hour battery and a charger. This is a good deal, as larger-capacity batteries can be expensive on their own, making this tool and 18-volt-battery combo a good choice to expand your existing Milwaukee set.\n\nThe Milwaukee 18-volt Hackzall reciprocating saw is on sale for $149, 52% off its typical price. This tool set also comes with a 5-amp-hour battery and a charger. The Hackzall version of the reciprocating saw has a compact, one-handed design, making it ideal for squeezing into smaller spaces where a larger tool won\u2019t fit.\n\nBatteries\n\nBatteries tend to be the most expensive component of cordless tools. They can also wear out over time, lasting for 2-3 years on average. With a few freshly charged batteries on hand, your projects will go faster, so it's worth picking up some spares at a discount.\n\nThe Milwaukee 8-amp-hour, 18-volt battery and charger is on sale for $149, 52% off its usual price. This set is a good deal because higher-capacity chargers last longer and can run more powerful tools. If you have a home shop situation that isn\u2019t close to a power outlet, having an 8-amp-hour battery for your cordless tools will allow you to work for hours without needing to swap the battery.\n\nThe Milwaukee 18-volt battery three-pack is on sale for $219, 33% off its regular price. This set of batteries includes two 18-volt cp3 batteries and one 18-volt, 5-amp-hour battery. The cp3 batteries are smaller and lighter, charging in 35 minutes on a Milwaukee rapid charger. The 5-amp-hour battery takes 60 minutes to top up on a rapid charger. This is a good deal on replacement batteries if you already have tools and chargers, but need to replace worn out batteries.\n\nBits\n\nBits for your drivers are essential, and having a good collection of various types and sizes will help to eliminate those lat-minute trips to the hardware store while working on a project.",

TikTok/just_a_glimpse_\n\nWith her mind for design and her husband\u2019s enthusiasm for building, she knew the pair could turn the plain shed into something special.\n\n\u201cAnything I want to do, my husband will make happen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s just got that brain.\u201d\n\nBut the couple also know their limits. Tuff Shed prebuilt most of the interior and the two balconies and patio. Cook\u2019s floor plan was all in her head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them, put the window 2 feet from the door,\u201d she says.\n\n7 The original interior of the shed. TikTok/just_a_glimpse_\n\nThe couple, who have no formal construction training, hired professionals for the crawl space foundation, electric, plumbing, and spray foam insulation. The lot already had a well and septic tank. A builder made sure everything was up to county house code.\n\nThe \u201cshome\u201d (combination of \u201cshed\u201d and \u201chome\u201d) ended up with two bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, two balconies, a full kitchen with a gas range and a large sunken island, laundry closet, and large patio.\n\nDIY route to turn a shed into a home\n\nThe stylish but homey interior is Cook\u2019s vision, a look she calls \u201ca blend of farmhouse and beach house\u2014even though it\u2019s on a lake.\u201d\n\nWhere Cook could have gone with drywall for the ceilings and walls, she insisted on tongue and groove and shiplap.\n\n7 The result of the renovation. Realtor.com\n\n\u201cI did that shiplap all by myself,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt came out beautiful, but it took a long time.\u201d\n\nThe unfinished kitchen cabinets were stock from Lowe\u2019s that Cook painted sage green to complement the green-infused Brazilian granite countertops that she fell for despite their hefty $6,000 price tag.\n\n\u201cI just like what I like,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything came out the way I saw it in my head.\u201d\n\n7 The couple added two balconies and a patio. TikTok/just_a_glimpse_\n\nCook also found vintage and Hobby Lobby pieces to jazz up the farmhouse-inspired decor (mostly bought from Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot).\n\nThere are also the whimsical touches such as the fish sink in one bathroom and a video arcade game in the kitchen. The floors are vinyl plank with custom carpet on the stairs and upper floors, to make them more kid-friendly.\n\nWhen a plumber left a drain line for the upstairs bathroom bulging from the kitchen wall, Richard improvised, building a matching sage-green birdhouse over the stove to stylishly conceal it.\n\nNot wanting to waste any space in the 1,296-square-foot shed, Cook added a half-bath under the stairs, along with a \u201cclubhouse\u201d for her grandkids.\n\n7 The lake house\u2019s new kitchen. Realtor.com\n\nTurning a profit on a shed-home\n\nThe cost to turn a shed into a home was approximately $170,000 (minus the shell).\n\nThe couple lived in it for six months while carrying out the renovation. They decided to list it so they could move on to their next project: a barndominium.\n\nThe shed-house received many offers and was sold over the asking price at $460,000.\n\n7 One of the house\u2019s 2.5 bathrooms. TikTok/just_a_glimpse_\n\nEven so, Cook feels if she\u2019d waited six months, \u201cI could have gotten an extra $100,000.\u201d\n\nShe also believes the home was priced too low because it can be listed only as a one-bedroom, despite having two, due to the home being on a \u201cone-bedroom septic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat hurt us on the appraisal,\u201d she says. However, the lake-view location definitely helped the home\u2019s popularity.\n\n7 One of the two bedrooms. TikTok/just_a_glimpse_\n\nCook admits, \u201cWe made a lot of money off it.\u201d\n\nSo did the buyer, who sold it in March 2025, closing at $505,000.\n\nAs to whether Cook will make a career of turning sheds into swoon-worthy homes, she laughs.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hired me, I\u2019d probably want to. I know my husband and kids want me to.\u201d\n\nDaughter Amanda McCormick, who made the TikTok reels showing off her mom\u2019s work, has bigger ideas.\n\n\u201cI want her to get a TV show,\u201d she says.",

            "content": "Dublin, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Ceiling Fans Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Ceiling Fan market is expected to reach US$ 18.90 billion by 2033 from US$ 13.06 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.19% from 2025 to 2033\n\nThe increasing cost of house improvement, maintenance, and renovation is the main driver of this growth. This increase is also expected to be aided by increasing technology developments in ceiling fan design. The need for ceiling fans is also being driven by infrastructure development projects and growing urbanization in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the growing demand for energy-efficient cooling solutions as well as improvements in design and technology, the ceiling fan market has grown steadily. In many areas, ceiling fans are favored over air conditioners because to their lower energy consumption, which makes them an economical and environmentally beneficial choice. The demand for ceiling fans is further increased by consumers looking for eco-friendly solutions as sustainability becomes more widely recognized.\n\nSmart ceiling fans, which are controlled by voice assistants and smartphones, are another technology advancement that is gaining popularity and giving conventional home cooling systems a contemporary feel. Tech-savvy consumers and those seeking to improve their living environment will find these innovations appealing.\n\n\n\nThe expansion of the building and remodeling industries, especially in developing nations with growing middle classes, is another factor propelling the ceiling fan market. The demand for ceiling fans is further increased by people spending in home renovation projects as their disposable incomes increase.\n\nFurthermore, the potential market for ceiling fan manufacturers has grown due to the increase in residential, commercial, and hospitality construction projects across the globe. The use of ceiling fans is being driven by the necessity for cost-effective cooling solutions and the fast urbanization of areas such as Asia-Pacific. In order to remain competitive as the industry changes, manufacturers are concentrating on cutting-edge designs, energy efficiency, and connectivity.\n\n\n\nIn order to meet this demand, manufacturers are spending money on R&D to produce luxury goods. Sustainability and energy efficiency are important factors; Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can save energy expenses by up to 40% when compared to conventional models. Furthermore, ceiling fans are now more convenient and adaptable thanks to smart technology like voice control and mobile app integration.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Ceiling Fan Market\n\nUrbanization and Construction Boom\n\n\n\nThe market for ceiling fans is mostly driven by the building boom in developing nations and the fast urbanization of the world. The need for residential, commercial, and hospitality buildings is rising as cities expand and infrastructure advances. Particularly in areas with moderate climates, ceiling fans are a great option for these new projects, which frequently call for economical and effective cooling solutions.\n\nMore homes are purchasing ceiling fans for both cooling and cosmetic reasons as a result of growing urban populations and increased disposable budgets. The commercial and hospitality industries, which include lodging facilities, workplaces, and retail establishments, also support market expansion since ceiling fans are viewed as reasonably priced, fashionable, and energy-efficient air conditioning substitutes that strike a compromise between comfort and cost.\n\n\n\nRising Disposable Incomes\n\n\n\nThe market for ceiling fans is mostly driven by the building boom in developing nations and the fast urbanization of the world. The need for residential, commercial, and hospitality buildings is rising as cities expand and infrastructure advances. Particularly in areas with moderate climates, ceiling fans are a great option for these new projects, which frequently call for economical and effective cooling solutions.\n\nMore homes are purchasing ceiling fans for both cooling and cosmetic reasons as a result of growing urban populations and increased disposable budgets. The commercial and hospitality industries, which include lodging facilities, workplaces, and retail establishments, also support market expansion since ceiling fans are viewed as reasonably priced, fashionable, and energy-efficient air conditioning substitutes that strike a compromise between comfort and cost.\n\n\n\nTechnological Advancements\n\n\n\nThe market for ceiling fans is being greatly influenced by technological developments, especially with the advent of smart ceiling fans. These fans have cutting-edge features like voice assistance, app connectivity, and remote control that make it simple for customers to change settings using smartphones or voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa. Incorporating smart fans with home automation systems can improve user experience, increase convenience, and save energy.\n\nThese cutting-edge items are attracting more and more customers, particularly those in tech-savvy and smart home ecosystems. Smart ceiling fans are not only useful but also aesthetically pleasing additions to contemporary homes and businesses thanks to features like automated temperature control, speed adjustment, and interaction with home energy systems.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Ceiling Fan Market\n\nChanging tastes in home decor\n\n\n\nNatural The market for ceiling fans is challenged by consumers' growing preference for aesthetics above functionality in home decor. A 2024 National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) poll found that 62% of homeowners think that home appliances' aesthetic appeal is important when making judgments about what to buy. This trend is particularly prevalent among younger consumers who place a higher priority on design than functionality.\n\n\n\nUp to 18% of prospective buyers have decided not to buy ceiling fans due to worries about how they affect home decor. This inclination has been further impacted by the prevalence of minimalistic and contemporary design trends; according to a 2023 American Lighting Association (ALA) survey, 37% of customers rank visual appeal as their top consideration when selecting ceiling fans. Furthermore, the popularity of open-concept floor plans - which accounted for 68% of newly constructed homes in 2022 - has made ceiling fans more noticeable, emphasizing the necessity for visually appealing designs.\n\n\n\nManufacturers are concentrating on creative designs that combine form and function in order to allay these worries. This entails incorporating lighting alternatives to match different interior styles, providing customized finishes, and utilizing contemporary materials like metal and wood. The ceiling fan market must adjust by offering goods that strike a mix between practicality and aesthetic appeal as tastes in home decor change.\n\n\n\nCompetition from Air Conditioners\n\n\n\nParticularly in areas with exceptionally hot climates, air conditioners, which offer quicker and more instantaneous cooling, present a serious threat to the ceiling fan business. Despite their reputation for being economical and energy-efficient, ceiling fans might not provide the same degree of quick temperature control as air conditioners.\n\nDue to their capacity to rapidly chill a space, consumers frequently favor air conditioners in regions with extreme or ongoing high temperatures. The demand for quicker and more potent cooling solutions restricts the growth of the ceiling fan market in these areas, even in spite of the increased awareness of environmental issues and energy saving. Consequently, ceiling fans have to contend with the perceived better cooling capabilities of air conditioners.\n\nKey Company Covered: Overview, Key Persons, Recent Development & Strategies, Product Portfolio, Financial Insights\n\nCrompton\n\nOrient electric\n\nHavells\n\nEmerson Electric\n\nLowe's Companies\n\nPanasonic\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 200 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $13.06 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $18.9 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 4.1% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Home Depot (HD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this home-improvement retailer have returned -14.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, which Home Depot falls in, has lost 13.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nHome Depot is expected to post earnings of $3.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.98 points to a change of -1.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.50 indicates a change of +10.2% from what Home Depot is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Home Depot.",

            "content": "Yes, I know Home Depot does have a section on their website called \u201cHubspace,\u201d which is a good start for many people wanting to have a smart home. What I am looking for is not for the do it yourself crowd, but for a bigger market.\n\nThis thought came about when I got in a discussion about the channel and, yet again, I heard someone say we need developers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we need developers, but the tools in the market for software and from many companies are pretty close to plug and play.\n\nHands on the keyboard are not hands and eyes in the field and, in so many cases, we have IoT devices that need to be installed remotely. I think we have a disconnect there.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 distributors like Get Wireless do a great job of supporting integrators and installation efforts. The question is, would a broader network make for a better market?\n\nIn general, I think IoT has not figured out its relationship with legacy systems.\n\nFor example, think about HVAC systems. If I am not in crisis mode, the only time I think about HVAC systems is when a van passes me on the road. I actually read their bulleted offerings on the truck and none of them say \u201cIoT\u201d or \u201cSmart Installations.\u201d Most of them are about fixing what\u2019s in place and it shows in their logos of brands like Carrier, Lennox, Rheem, Trane, and others, or they have graphics depicting men or trucks \u201cin motion\u201d running to solve the problem.\n\nOur HVAC IoT solutions are focused on new installations. It feels like a niche market that runs into the bust and bubble of construction.\n\nBack to Home Depot\u2026 The materials are there but, unlike the website, I have yet to hit a \u201cHubSpace\u201d aisle. So, the possibilities of what can be improved by IoT installations is incoherent and disjointed. In addition, Hub Space is really a phone app connecting to various vendors using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\n\nI realize that the vast majority of humans are not looking for \u201ccheap and cheerful\u201d IoT that just works. But, I think we are close to being there. While it has taken time to develop and, particularly now, with the ability to activate via eSIM, the chance is there to become more mainstream.\n\nWe can mask the wizardry of wireless and just work, which means electricians, plumbers and general contractors can safely go to Home Depot and pick up what they need if it\u2019s on the shelf.\n\nI recognize that, from Home Depot\u2019s perspective, this is asking them to have a marketing plan that goes beyond the deal flyer and needs a business model that sells systems more than parts. But, given the size of displays for cabinets and kitchen appliances, you would think a little room could be set aside for a central hub space and that contractors would find the possibility of upselling solutions to their customers a good deal.\n\nHere a are few more ideas as to why it would work.\n\nHubspace Smart Home is already in motion, so making it more contractor-friendly would be relatively easy to initiate.\n\nHubspace already sells thermostats, so adding support for larger HVAC systems is not that a very big stretch.\n\nContractors are already coming to the store, so Home Depot has a head start on reaching the market.\n\nNowhere else is the diversity of IoT solutions more centralized than a place like Home Depot, where pools, kitchens, HVAC, window shades and everything else a home needs are all available for installers and integrators to price out solutions.\n\nA dedicated department could provide customer support and education to not only consumers, but commercial buyers as well.\n\nNew strategic partnerships and business models can develop that add to the value of being the place to shop for smart solutions.\n\nI have made my case for Home Depot to increase its prevalence in IoT and smart solutions. I would love to hear the counter arguments and, more importantly the ways to make a more mainstream channel.Edited by Erik Linask",

            "content": "Within dividend investing, companies with a consistent track record of dividend growth tend to attract greater investor interest. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that firms with ample cash reserves are better positioned to sustain and expand their operations while continuing to pay stable or increasing dividends. To assess the sustainability of dividends, companies must evaluate whether their payouts are supported by cash generated from operating activities and the availability of free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures\u2014such as spending on property, plants, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014from cash flow generated through operations. Excess cash can be allocated toward dividends, debt reduction, share buybacks, or business expansion.\n\nThe significance of dividend stocks is well established, with extensive research examining their long-term performance. A study by Robert Arnott found that over a period of more than 200 years, ending in 2002, the US stock market delivered an average annualized total return of 7.9%, with dividend reinvestment accounting for 5% of that growth. Beyond enhancing overall returns, dividends also provide a buffer during market downturns. Various studies have shown that companies paying dividends tend to experience lower downside risk and recover losses more quickly, ultimately leading to higher risk-adjusted returns over extended investment periods.\n\nThe Dobermans of the Dow strategy serves as an alternative to the well-known Dogs of the Dow approach, offering a more selective screening process. While the Dogs of the Dow ranks stocks solely based on dividend yield, the Dobermans method prioritizes high-quality companies trading at attractive valuations. The selection process involves two key steps: first, the 30 stocks in the Dow are ranked by Return on Equity (ROE), with the top 20 retained. Then, these 20 companies are further ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, narrowing the selection to the final ten stocks, which form the Dobermans portfolio. Historically, a hypothetical portfolio following this approach and rebalanced annually has delivered superior performance compared to the Dow, the broader market, and the Dogs of the Dow strategy, according to a report by Forbes. The report further mentioned that since 2000, this methodology has generated a cumulative return of 810%, more than doubling the long-term performance of these benchmarks.\n\nWe recently published a list of Dobermans of the Dow: 10 Stocks to Consider . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other Dobermans of the Dow to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA positive or growing free cash flow often signals stable or increasing profitability. Since strong free cash flow may indicate a healthy balance sheet, S&P Dow Jones conducted an analysis to determine whether free cash flow yield\u2014measured as annual free cash flow per share divided by stock price\u2014provides valuable insights into investment returns. The underlying investment thesis suggested that all else being equal, companies with a higher free cash flow yield are preferable, as they generate greater free cash income for each dollar invested.\n\nAn analysis of the broader market universe, divided into quintiles based on free cash flow yield, revealed that the top-quintile stocks delivered an annualized return of 15.7% between December 1990 and June 2017. This performance exceeded the returns of all other quintiles and outpaced the broader market by an average of 3.6%. While the bottom two quintiles also achieved respectable returns of 11.0% and 8.6% annually, respectively, both underperformed relative to the overall equity market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered the Dow stocks by Return on Equity, narrowing the list to the top 20. These are then ranked by Free Cash Flow Yield, with the top 10 earning the title \u201cDobermans of the Dow.\u201d The stocks are ranked according to their free cash flow yield. In cases where multiple stocks had the same free cash flow yield, the number of hedge fund investors was used as a deciding factor. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (HD): Among Dobermans of the Dow to Buy\n\nA home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nFree Cash Flow Yield: 0.04\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement company that offers tools, appliances, construction products, and related services. The home improvement industry has generally experienced steady growth, and as the dominant player in the sector, Home Depot benefits from these organic trends. Over the past few years, the company has made significant investments in its stores, digital platforms, and product selection, strengthening its position even amid an inflationary environment. One key initiative has been enhancing its logistics network to improve delivery speed, particularly for large and bulky items. Moreover, the company has pursued strategic acquisitions, with its most recent purchase of SRS Distribution aimed at expanding services for its Pro customers. This move broadens its market reach and creates new opportunities for growth.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) posted solid fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, with revenue climbing to $39.7 billion\u2014reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 14%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, the company expects total sales to grow by approximately 2.8%, while comparable sales are projected to rise by around 1% over the same 52-week period. In addition, the company plans to expand its footprint with roughly 13 new store openings and anticipates a gross margin of about 33.4%.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) held more than $1.65 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Over the course of fiscal 2024, the company generated close to $20 billion in operating cash flow, reinforcing its financial strength. This stability has enabled it to maintain an uninterrupted streak of dividend payments spanning 152 consecutive quarters. On February 25, the company increased its dividend by 2.2% to $2.30 per share, marking its 15th straight year of dividend growth. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $2.30 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.46%, as of March 10.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 9th on our list of Dobermans of the Dow to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

But more discerning DIYers might be swayed by the particular brands the store carries (i.e. Pella versus Andersen windows) or which store credit card they have. Now, both Home Depot and Lowe's are throwing another variable into the mix, as they've just announced competing AI customer service features.\n\nRELATED: Walgreens and CVS Announce Major Pharmacy Changes\u2014Here's How They'll Affect You .\n\nHome Depot just unveiled its Magic Apron smart tool.\n\nIn a March 6 press release , Home Depot unveiled Magic Apron, an AI tool available on the Home Depot app and \"millions\" of website product pages.\n\n\"The first-of-its-kind technology is powered by a proprietary home improvement knowledge base, combining large-scale datasets with The Home Depot\u2019s own expertise and product information,\" reads the release. \"It\u2019s like having your trusted store associate on hand, delivering reliable, accurate answers.\"\n\nHow can customers use this tool?\n\nFor example, if you're on the product page for a pressure washer, you can ask Magic Apron questions like, \"How do I know what size pressure washer I need?\" The tool will break down the different specs of the sizes and give you scenarios in which you'd use each (washing cars, cleaning a deck, etc.).\n\nOr, if you ask something like, \"How many bags of mulch do I need for a small garden bed?\" you'll receive a full step-by-step breakdown of how to calculate this.\n\nJordan Broggi , executive vice president of customer experience and president of online at Home Depot, said that the goal of Magic Apron is to provide online customers with the same level of customer service they'd find in-store.\n\nIn the coming months, Magic Apron will roll out new features, including \"design ideas, product comparisons, and recommendations,\" according to Bloomberg . The press release also states that the tool will expand to the Home Depot Pro website, \"offering tailored support to professional contractors and business account users.\"\n\nHome Depot\n\nRELATED: Big Lots Is Opening Remodeled Stores Next Month\u2014Here's Where .\n\nAnd Lowe's unveiled its own AI assistant, Mylow.\n\nJust a day before Home Depot's announcement, Lowe's unveiled its own AI assistant, Mylow.\n\n\"Developed in collaboration with OpenAI and leveraging Lowe\u2019s expert advice, Mylow delivers the expertise of a trusted Lowe\u2019s associate anytime and anywhere, providing customers with clear steps and practical solutions for projects ranging in type and complexity all from the palm of their hand,\" reads the press release .\n\nThe tool's capabilities seem pretty similar to Magic Apron, but there's a caveat to Mylow: It's currently only available on desktop and mobile views for MyLowe\u2019s Rewards loyalty members. The company says it will expand to the Lowe's app with voice capabilities later this year.\n\n- YouTube www.youtube.com",

Moving away from in-store deliveries has also helped reduce aisle clutter from staged orders.\n\nIn 2020, the company announced plans to build about 150 flatbed distribution centers to offer same- and next-day delivery to 90% of U.S. customers. That distribution model helps the company efficiently pick, pack and ship lumber and other building materials.\n\nThe retailer has also worked to expand its product assortment across its 19 direct fulfillment centers, which ship products like flooring, windows and doors.\n\nLastly, the company has also been able to partner with third-party last mile providers to make progress on its delivery experience for customers, Bastek said.\n\nOther retailers leaning on self-operated distribution centers for deliveries include Best Buy. The company is leaning less on its stores as it adjust to brick-and-mortar operations for omnichannel shopping.\n\nThe focus on fulfilling orders from distribution centers allows employees to dedicate time to in-store sales and order pickups. This trend grew during the pandemic as more customers opted for online orders and the company aimed to balance in-store service and e-commerce fulfillment capabilities.",

Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s both launched generative AI assistants on their websites this week: Magic Apron, as Home Depot calls its tool, and Mylow, the Lowe\u2019s version, can give product recommendations, summarize reviews and even offer some how-to advice. They\u2019re just the latest retailers looking to soup up their customer experience with an AI bot.\n\nPersonally, I do need a lot of help with weeds after our winter rains. Home Depot\u2019s \u201cpresident of online,\u201d Jordan Broggi, said it sounds like I\u2019m in the market for some weed killer.\n\n\u201cYou might have a set of basic questions, \u2018How much do I need? Is this going to, you know, kill the weeds that I have in my lawn, and is it going to harm my grass? You know, how do I apply it?'\u201d he said.\n\nBroggi said Magic Apron, Home Depot\u2019s AI tool, is meant to simulate the in-store experience. \u201cWhatever it may be, this is intended to help answer those questions in real time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lowe\u2019s Mylow AI suggested mulch to suppress new weeds once I\u2019ve sprayed. And, after some coaxing, it calculated how many bags I\u2019d need to buy.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re really promising because they have the step-by-step,\u201d said Greg Zakowicz, a strategist at ecommerce marketing platform Omnisend.\n\nHe said AI assistants are on almost every website now, though many don\u2019t seem to have a clear function. \u201cWe\u2019re just at an early stage where the companies put them on, figure out what works, what doesn\u2019t, and then refine them,\u201d he said.\n\nFor retailers, these tools provide a valuable new stream of consumer data to analyze, said Anastasiya Ghosh, a marketing professor at the University of Arizona.\n\n\u201cLike, what is the first question a person asks when they\u2019re buying a washing machine?\u201d she said.\n\nBut the more personalized and \u201ccreative\u201d these chatbots get, the bigger the risks. Generative AI is still prone to hallucination and other errors.\n\n\u201cSo if I buy something, let\u2019s say a piece of furniture, and assemble it myself, but if I followed your instructions \u2026 and I don\u2019t like it now, that\u2019s your fault,\u201d Ghosh said.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s Jordan Broggi said the advice is clearly labeled as AI-generated.\n\n\u201cI think customers are in the process of getting more familiar with using tools like this and knowing that they can be extremely helpful, even if they\u2019re not 100% accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nSort of like weed killer.",

Johnson St., got some hope for new life after being vacant since 2008.\n\nThe 8.65-acre property, called Corta Commons at Forest Plaza, would be split into five retail spaces, similar to the former Shopko's transformation into Big Lots and Hobby Lobby in 2021 and 2022. Mid-America Real Estate had also handled that project, though now Ollie's Bargain Outlet occupies the former Big Lots space.\n\nAt the time, the Home Depot site listing created buzz on social media, not only because of promised activity at a long-vacant site, but also because of a number of retailers labeled on a floor plan included in the initial listing: Burlington, Ross Dress for Less, Five Below and Ulta Beauty.\n\nHowever, Mid-America Real Estate Principal Mike Fitzgerald said at the time the company was talking with retailers to fill the spaces and marketing the space to new retail tenancy, but had yet to land any commitments. He could not confirm any specific retailers considering the space.\n\nAs of March 10, the lease listing, now just called The Commons at Forest Plaza, does not include the floor plan or any other hints to possible tenants. One of the five spaces is still available, consisting of 9,750 square feet of the total 93,700 square-foot redevelopment space.\n\nMore: Fond du Lac, what's your favorite sandwich and where do you get it? Tell us.\n\nForest Mall Redevelopment\n\nMid-America Real Estate also lists the last remaining parcel of the Forest Mall Redevelopment for sale or lease.\n\nThe lease listing includes the two spaces at 835 W. Johnson St. in what remains of Forest Mall, behind T.J. Maxx. A 57,400 square-foot \"big box\" space has entry between T.J. Maxx and Kohl's, and a 3,700 square-foot space is available on the other side of T.J. Maxx.\n\nThe sale listing includes the approximately 6-acre lot, though T.J. Maxx and IHOP would continue to be owned separately.\n\nIn addition to Kohl's and T.J. Maxx, anchors on the property will include grocery chain Meijer and the ThedaCare Medical Center-Fond du Lac campus, the latter of which is finishing up construction.\n\nRetail center in former Johnson Street Tuckers\n\nThe Johnson Street Tuckers Hamburgers closed in 2022, after retiring owner Steve Blagoue sold both Tuckers locations to Coffee Holdings LLC. The Main Street location remains open as a tenant on the property, run by Blagoue's son, Joe Blagoue.\n\nHalf of the Johnson Street building became a Caribou Coffee a year later \u2014 just before a second Caribou Coffee opened in the outlot of the Main Street location \u2014 but the other half has yet to be occupied.\n\nAs of March 10, the 2,617 square-foot space is available for lease, and the developers are also willing to sell.\n\nThe Shops at Westwind\n\nThree suites are available in the Shops at Westwind, on the corner of Johnson Street and Rolling Meadows Drive.\n\nSharing a building with Spectrum, Pizza Hut, Kay Jewelers and more, size ranges from 1,000 to 1,500 square feet.\n\nThe first suite is between Shopko Optical and Sherwin Williams, and the second is between Sherwin Williams and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. The third, not facing Johnson Street, is between Pizza Hut and Crumbl Cookies.\n\nJohnson Crossing\n\nOn Fond du Lac's east side, Johnson Crossing has two spaces available for lease near Festival Foods, as well as nearly an acre of outlot space on the northern end of the property available for ground lease or build to suit.\n\nThe first space is 4,000 square feet next to Ledgevest Financial and the Froedtert Clinic, and the other space is 1,500 square feet, between the Allen J. Buechel Branch of the Fond du Lac Public Library and Fresh Fit Caf\u00e9.\n\nMore: Boys & Girls Club of Fond du Lac's Reach for the Stars raises $165K for summer programming\n\nFormer Wendt's Auto Body lot\n\nYet another Johnson Street property, this time listed by Solberg Real Estate, is the former Wendt's Auto Body at 402 W. Johnson St.\n\nThe building was demolished in August 2023, and now the property is listed as a development opportunity on a \"main business artery.\" It has potential to be split into two lots, both 0.78 acres in size.\n\nDaphne Lemke is the Streetwise reporter for the Fond du Lac Reporter.

Over time, these assets will be integrated into Home Depot\u2019s operations, enhancing our ability to serve professional contractors.\u201d\n\nHome Depot's acquisition of SRS Distribution , a leading supplier of roofing, landscaping, and specialty building products plays a \"crucial\" role in the company's strategy to enhance its pro services.\n\n\u201cA small contractor may use us end-to-end in our stores, but we understand that larger pros need more than just cash-and-carry services,\u201d Devine said. \u201cWe\u2019re building out our pro ecosystem to provide solutions that save time and streamline project management.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s investments in infrastructure and technology were the main focus of the Las Vegas exhibit, which was organized into six pillars of growth: Sales and support; digital tools, house account, Pro Supply House, delivery and fulfillment and Path to Pro (a platform connecting tradespeople with jobs).\n\nWhile Home Depot stores remain a crucial touchpoint for pros\u2014typically within a five- to ten-minute drive from job sites\u2014the company has been investing in logistics infrastructure to enhance delivery capabilities. This includes flatbed distribution centers, direct fulfillment centers, and a more sophisticated order management system.\n\nPreviously, contractors had to pay upfront and wait for materials to arrive. Now, Home Depot is introducing an order management system that enables order intake, planning, and orchestration, followed by delivery and post-delivery billing\u2014aligning its approach more closely with wholesale suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe know that our delivery services needed to improve,\u201d Devine acknowledged. \u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on assets and capabilities to make sure our contractors get materials exactly when they need them.\n\nThe success of these investments in FDCs, direct fulfillment centers and sales team expansion were described by Senior Executive Vice President Ann-Marie Campbell during the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call (which coincided with IBS.) They led to more than $1 billion in incremental sales on an annualized basis in the 17 markets where they are in various stages of maturity.\n\nThe FDC network alone has \u201cenabled faster delivery, expanded fulfillment options, and more consistent on-time and complete delivery of larger orders directly to the job site,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd not only are we gaining traction with the larger pros that work on complex projects, we are also seeing meaningful lift in sales with all pros across all purchase occasions,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nThe company\u2019s emphasis on the pro customer in early 2025 is faced with home-building market clouded by uncertainty (think tariffs). But Devine says Home Depot has weathered economic fluctuations before, including supply chain disruptions (think Covid) and shifts in consumer spending habits. Devine stressed that the company remains committed to offering competitive pricing and reliable service, regardless of external challenges.\n\n\u201cNo one has a crystal ball,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get asked about tariffs all the time, but the reality is that over half of our products come from U.S. suppliers, and we\u2019ve diversified our supply chain significantly. The key for us is always to focus on providing value to our customers.\u201d\n\nTime will tell to what extent the company\u2019s focus and its six pillars lead to growth.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCustomer-facing AI tools are finding a place in home improvement retail, with Lowe\u2019s and The Home Depot each launching their own tools this week.\n\nLowe\u2019s launched Mylow, an AI-powered adviser developed in partnership with OpenAI, to help answer customers\u2019 home improvement questions, Wednesday. The software is available to MyLowe\u2019s rewards members through the Lowe\u2019s website. Mylow will include voice capabilities and be available on the Lowe\u2019s app later this year.\n\nHome Depot introduced Magic Apron, a suite of generative AI tools designed to improve search results and answer questions, Thursday. Magic Apron is available on \u201cmillions\u201d of product pages at Home Depot\u2019s website and through its mobile app.\n\nBoth home improvement retailers\u2019 solutions are designed to complement, rather than replace, associates, assisting workers as well as customers. The tools seek to offer shoppers the level of guidance they would receive in-store while browsing online.\n\nMylow will work alongside the retailer\u2019s associate-facing app, which uses the same technology, and the Lowe\u2019s Digital Home Platform, which offers MyLowe\u2019s Rewards members personalized product information and maintenance suggestions.\n\nThe Mylow logo Courtesy of Lowe's\n\n\u201cWe're aiming to deliver the best customer service in retail, and Mylow represents an industry-leading step forward in helping us do that,\u201d Seemantini Godbole, chief digital and information officer at Lowe\u2019s, said in a prepared statement. \u201cThis solution will not only help our customers be more informed, but our associates too.\u201d\n\nMagic Apron is designed to bring the experience of work with a Home Depot associate from the store into the digital world.\n\n\"Home Depot customers have always relied on the expertise of our orange-aproned associates in the aisles of our stores to answer questions and help them solve problems,\" Jordan Broggi, EVP of customer experience and president of online at Home Depot, said in a prepared statement.\n\nAI assistance with a conversational tone\n\nBoth home improvement retailers\u2019 AI-powered tools are capable of offering answers to conversational questions, though each company highlighted different aspects of their capabilities.\n\nMylow is designed to share content that is digestible for DIY customers of any experience level, and leaders noted the tool would offer links to products for seamless checkout on a Q4 2024 earnings call last month. Users can further refine the AI assistant\u2019s recommendations with details like their budget or ZIP code.\n\nMagic Apron\u2019s tool suite aims to handle tasks like offering how-to instructions, suggesting products and summarizing reviews. Home Depot plans to roll out additional features in the coming months including design ideas and product comparisons.\n\nBoth solutions are capable of offering step-by-step guides in response to customer queries. Each can respond to conversational questions, such as how much mulch a customer needs for their garden project.\n\nThe Magic Apron logo Courtesy of The Home Depot\n\nHome Depot\u2019s AI-powered tools are currently only available on Home Depot\u2019s DIY site, but the solution will roll out to the retailer\u2019s professional B2B site soon. There, the AI-powered tools will offer support tailored to the needs of contractors and business account customers.\n\nDual approaches to customer experience\n\nLowe\u2019s and Home Depot have each put customer experience front and center on recent investor calls.\n\nLowe\u2019s is focusing on a tech-forward CX strategy that leans into AI to power better in-store and online experiences. The ultimate goal is to create an interconnected experience through its combined loyalty and technology investments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that there is still a great deal of opportunity for us to grow market share with both pro and DIY customers by building loyalty with our current customers and winning new customers looking for a friction-free shopping experience within home improvement,\u201d Marvin Ellison, president and CEO of Lowe\u2019s, said on a December analyst and investor presentation.\n\nHome Depot has a heavy emphasis on the professional contractor experience through improvements to the in-store experience, including through a pro customer-focused manager role and flexible last-mile options such as direct jobsite delivery.\n\n\u201cOur strategic priorities remain creating the best interconnected shopping experience, growing our pro wallet share through a unique ecosystem of capabilities and building new stores,\u201d Ted Decker, president and CEO of Home Depot, said during a Q4 2024 earnings call last week.",

            "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Wall Street had another ugly open as investors remained concerned about President Donald Trump's tariffs and economic uncertainty more broadly. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down over 3.5%, while the S & P 500 is lower by almost 2%. The 30-stock Dow is the relative outperformer, down about 300 points, or 0.75%. Jim Cramer summarized our approach to the weak market like this: \"We have to be targeted. We have to buy the stocks that we love because this is the moment we've been waiting for, and we have to sell the stocks that are unnaturally up or parabolic.\" The latter bucket includes Abbott Labs and Bristol Myers Squibb , which have benefited from a rotation into defensively oriented health-care names. We trimmed both Friday. 2. Jim suggested investors without any Home Depot exposure consider starting a position in the stock, which is up 1.5% on Monday thanks to a decline in bond yields. We bought some Friday. \"Home Depot when interest rates are down is terrific,\" Jim said. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which influences borrowing costs across the economy including mortgage rates, was around 4.22% on Monday. Less than a month ago, it was at 4.6%. Conversely, Jim cautioned against buying any restaurant stocks right now because the group has fallen out of favor. Our lone restaurant name, Texas Roadhouse , has actually outperformed the S & P 500 over the past five days and one month, though. 3. Eli Lilly is among our worst-performing stocks Monday, falling more than 3.5%. Lilly's chief rival in the GLP-1 drug class Novo Nordisk was getting hit harder, down almost 10%, after releasing another batch of trial results looking at its next-generation weight-loss treatment called CagriSema. The impact to Lilly is unclear at this point. Lilly's decline Monday may be more about a rotation away from momentum stocks and toward more defensive, higher-yielding names such as Bristol Myers. 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Sherwin-Williams , Airbnb , Emerson Electric , DoorDash , and stock 5.

            "content": "The Home Depot Inc. HD has maintained its leadership position in the home improvement market through ongoing investments in technology, digital capabilities and supply-chain efficiency. However, the company\u2019s current forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.74X raises concerns about whether the stock's valuation is justified. This multiple is higher than the Zacks Retail \u2013 Home Furnishing industry average of 22.11X, making the stock appear relatively expensive.\n\n\n\nThe high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of Home Depot, an Atlanta, GA-based home improvement retailer, adds to investor unease, especially considering its low Value Score of D, which suggests that it may not be a strong value proposition at current levels. The company has a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 2.28X compared with the industry\u2019s 1.6X.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHome Depot\u2019s Premium Valuation Surpasses Peers\n\nAt 24.74X forward 12-month P/E, HD is trading at a valuation much higher than its competitors. Its competitors, such as Lowe\u2019s Companies Inc. LOW, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ETD and Williams-Sonoma WSM, are delivering solid growth and trade at more reasonable multiples. LOW, ETD and WSM have forward 12-month P/E ratios of 19.52X, 11.15X and 21.87X \u2014 all lower than Home Depot. At such levels, HD\u2019s stock valuation seems out of step with its growth trajectory.\n\n\n\nThe stock\u2019s premium valuation suggests that investors have strong expectations for Home Depot\u2019s growth potential. However, the stock currently seems somewhat overvalued. As a result, investors might be hesitant to buy at these elevated levels and prefer to wait for a more favorable entry point.\n\n\n\nWhile HD\u2019s share price has declined 9.5% in the past month, many investors are questioning whether the recent dip presents a buying opportunity. After the recent drop in share price, the Home Depot stock has underperformed the broader industry\u2019s 8.5% decline. The stock also underperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s fall of 7.5% and the S&P 500\u2019s decline of 5.1% in the same period.\n\nHD Stock\u2019s One-Month Price Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently trading at $376.80, the stock reflects a 16.4% premium to its 52-week low mark of $323.77 and a 14.2% discount from its 52-week high of $439.37. The technical indicators show that the stock is trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish sentiment.\n\nHome Depot Stock Trades Below 50-Day & 200-Day Moving Averages\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnderstanding HD\u2019s Growth Drivers Vs Ongoing Challenges\n\nWhile investors may be concerned about Home Depot\u2019s pricey valuation, its recent share price decline and ongoing initiatives show that the stock still attracts favorable sentiment. However, it is wise to closely evaluate whether the stock is worth buying at current prices.\n\n\n\nHD remains confident in its strategic initiatives to drive business growth. The company continues to invest in creating a seamless, interconnected customer experience, enhancing the Pro wallet with its robust ecosystem, and expanding its store footprint. It also remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the home improvement industry and its ability to capture a larger market share.\n\n\n\nIts premium valuation reflects a strong commitment to customer service, catering to both DIY enthusiasts and professional (Pro) contractors. With an extensive store network, diverse product offerings and a growing digital presence, Home Depot effectively meets evolving consumer needs.\n\n\n\nThe company's \"One Home Depot\" strategy, supported by a solid technology infrastructure, has consistently boosted online engagement. Ongoing investments in the Pro ecosystem strengthen its position in the market.\n\n\n\nHome Depot\u2019s well-optimized inventory management, high employee engagement, and expanding e-commerce and home delivery services are expected to drive continued market share growth. The acquisition of SRS Distribution reinforces its leadership in building material distribution, enhancing services for professional contractors and tradespeople.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not Right With Home Depot?\n\nHD, a leading force in the home improvement industry, continues to navigate challenges stemming from softened demand and pressure on discretionary, high-ticket categories. This ongoing weakness has weighed on the overall sales and comparable sales performances.\n\n\n\nFor fiscal 2025, management projects a 2.8% year-over-year sales increase, whereas it reported 4.5% sales growth in fiscal 2024. Comparable sales are expected to rise 1% for the 52 weeks of fiscal 2025. The company forecasts a flat gross margin of 33.4%, whereas the operating margin is projected at 13% and the adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be 13.4%, indicating slight declines from the fiscal 2024 reported levels.\n\n\n\nIn addition to softer consumer spending, elevated interest rates have posed profitability challenges. Home Depot's management noted that higher borrowing costs, which emerged in early 2024, are likely to persist, influencing consumer purchasing behavior and financial conditions.\n\n\n\nNet interest expenses are expected to rise to $2.2 billion, up from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024. As a result, Home Depot anticipates GAAP earnings per share to decline 3% year over year, with adjusted EPS falling 2%. Despite these headwinds, the company remains focused on long-term growth strategies to strengthen its market position.\n\nHD\u2019s Estimates Reflect Downtrend\n\nLed by the cautious outlook, Home Depot\u2019s estimates have shown a declining trend in the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HD\u2019s fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings per share declined 3.4% and 2%, respectively, in the last 30 days. The downward revision in earnings estimates indicates that analysts are less confident about the company\u2019s growth potential.\n\n\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HD\u2019s sales implies 2.7% year-over-year growth, whereas the EPS estimate indicates a 1.1% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 sales and earnings suggests 4.3% and 9.5% year-over-year growth, respectively.\n\n\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs the Slowdown in Home Depot Stock a Buy Opportunity?\n\nHD\u2019s premium valuation and cautious outlook raise valid concerns for investors. Though Home Depot's earnings guidance is somewhat disappointing, growth initiatives like the \"One Home Depot\" plan and strong Pro customer sales position it well for the long term. Also, the recent pullback in the HD stock offers a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking to participate in the retailer\u2019s promising long-term growth.\n\n\n\nHowever, some caution is warranted, given the prevailing headwinds, which call for a thorough evaluation of recent developments before making investment decisions. For current shareholders, retaining this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock may prove advantageous in the long term.

It announced a suite of generative AI tools, which it calls Magic Apron, on Thursday. The company said the tools have the capacity to answer how-to questions, provide further details about products and aid consumers with home improvement projects.\n\nWhen a consumer visits Home Depot\u2019s site, Magic Apron works to enhance their experience by summarizing product reviews, sharing product guides and enabling users to ask specific questions. For instance, if a consumer wanted to purchase a build-it-yourself shed, but wasn\u2019t sure if they had the correct materials for it, they might ask Magic Apron what they need.\n\nAccording to the release, now marks the right time to release Magic Apron because the retailer\u2019s \u201cbusy spring selling season\u201d is slated to begin shortly. Consumers will be able to access the new features 24/7.\n\nJordan Broggi, executive vice president of customer experience and president of online, said technology will help the retailer unify physical and digital experiences to adequately meet customers\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cHome Depot customers have always relied on the expertise of our orange-aproned associates in the aisles of our stores to answer questions and help them solve problems,\u201d Broggi said in a statement. \u201cMagic Apron is designed to bring that same expertise to the digital world, leveraging our proprietary knowledge base to support our customers and give them the confidence to tackle their home improvement projects, anytime, anywhere.\u201d\n\nHome Depot said Magic Apron is \u201cpowered by best-in-class large language models,\u201d though it did not disclose the third-party providers responsible for that technology. The models are both trained on Home Depot\u2019s data and knowledge of home improvement projects and on publicly available information that can augment the company\u2019s proprietary inputs. It plans to continue training the model on consumer and associate feedback over time.\n\nIn the future, Home Depot anticipates Magic Apron will act as \u201ca personal home improvement concierge\u201d and will, thus, be able to share design ideas, compare products, give product recommendations and more.\n\nDavid\u2019s Bridal reinvents business strategy with AI at the wheel\n\nWedding retailer David\u2019s Bridal is overhauling its business strategy\u2014and its leadership. Part of the company\u2019s future roadmap is heavily reliant on AI; its new plan is entitled \u201cAisle to Algorithm,\u201d a nod to the role technology is slated to play in the company\u2019s future interactions with consumers.\n\nAccording to a release from the company, it already uses AI for more than 90 percent of its virtual customer communications, from emails to texts and more. It plans to invest in a \u201cpersonalized AI-powered planning tool and marketplace\u201d to simplify the inspiration process for brides throughout their journeys.\n\nSpecifically, the company will launch a platform that allows brides to discover vendors, plan the details of their special days and manage outstanding details. Vendors will also be able to use the tools to their advantage, with AI-powered matchmaking based on data. The company is expected to share more about the tools that make up that product suite in Q2.\n\nKelly Cook, David Bridal\u2019s new CEO, said the strategy and technology will help make the leadup to a bride\u2019s wedding day special.\n\n\u201cServing her is all we think about, that\u2019s why we call ourselves \u2018Dream Makers.\u2019 We are poised to become the only player in the wedding industry with an integrated retail, loyalty, media, and planning ecosystem\u2014backed by proprietary first-party data no competitor can match. We are redefining what it means to plan, shop and celebrate life\u2019s most special moments for consumers and innovating how brands can authentically connect with consumers during these defining moments,\u201d Cook said in a statement.\n\nDavid\u2019s also plans to leverage the Pearl Media Network offering it launched in December 2024. That platform uses AI to help deliver targeted ads to those in the market for wedding items.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Pinterest\u2019s AI labeling experiment?\n\nAs generative AI continues to become more mainstream\u2014and more powerful\u2014a broad swath of fake images, some depicting people and others depicting clothing, recipes, vacation scenes or otherwise, have started to cloud social media platforms.\n\nPinterest, where so many go to gain inspiration for their next creative endeavor, vacation, party or recipe, is no exception to that. In response, the company has started to add labels to certain images to help users discern which photos have been generated, in whole or in part, by AI systems.\n\nIt appears the process is still under experimentation. Meta, too, has given users an option to add a tag to posts, indicating that they have been significantly altered by\u2014or totally created by\u2014AI.\n\n\u201cPinterest may show a label on the close-up of an image Pin when we detect that it was generated or altered with AI,\u201d the company\u2019s informational site about its AI practices notes. \u201cWe\u2019re working on ways to expand capabilities to better identify gen AI content in the future through additional technologies.\u201d\n\nBut for Pinterest, it appears its early experimentation hasn\u2019t been wholly effective in cleaning up what\u2019s often known as \u201cAI slop\u201d\u2014or artificially generated images that give users an unrealistic expectation when trying to recreate something, whether a hairstyle, an outfit or a recipe. Upon searching for \u201cbraided hairstyles,\u201d many of the options popping up had been created by AI but weren\u2019t labeled; the same result occurred when searching for \u201cmaximalist design.\u201d\n\nAn AI-generated image that appears without labeling when searching for \u201cmaximalist design\u201d on Pinterest.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that social media will continue to flood with these types of images, and some companies may be required by law to label AI-generated content in the future. A spokesperson for Pinterest told Futurism that it will continue working on the issue.\n\n\u201cImpressions on generative AI content make up a small percentage of the total impressions on Pinterest,\u201d the spokesperson told Futurism in an email. \u201cAs people continue experimenting with generative AI content, we are working to provide users with more control and context over the content they see on Pinterest. Pinterest will continue intentionally leveraging AI, such as our inclusive AI features, to enhance the experience for our users and creators.\u201d",

Evidence that Home Depot has achieved this stasis is that it has leveled off its store openings. It no longer needs to expand geographically. The graph shown below tells the story.\n\n(Image credit: Louis Navellier)\n\nThe question that we will address here is: What has Home Depot done now that it has built its moat that consists of about 2,300 stores in all of the markets it needs to be in?\n\nIn short, Home Depot has dramatically increased the sales that it generates from each of its locations. For instance, in 2005, Home Depot had 1,890 stores and revenues of $73 billion, for sales per store of about $39 million. At the end of 2023, with 2,335 stores and sales of about $157 billion, sales per store are $67 million, an increase of 71.8%. Wow.\n\nA closer look at Home Depot's financial statements shows what it did with increased revenues to increase its profitability. Notably, the gross profit margin for Home Depot has held steady at about 32% for the past 20 years. This indicates that it is not earning more profits by raising prices on consumers, and this keeps consumers coming back (which gives a boost to same-store sales growth).\n\nWhere Home Depot has made enormous strides is in managing its operating costs. That is, once the customer comes through the door, they will experience great prices, but Home Depot has dramatically reduced the cost of servicing that customer. Specifically, the low point for Home Depot\u2019s operating margin was 7.5% in 2009. In 2023, the operating margin was 14.2%. Over time, Home Depot has nearly doubled the profitability it earns on each customer.\n\nAll this translates into a stellar bottom line in terms of total net income, but when converted to earnings per share, Home Depot has turbocharged the growth by reducing the number of shares outstanding from 2.2 billion in 2004 to just 993 million in 2023.\n\nThat is why total earnings have grown at an average annual rate of almost 6% percent, while the earnings per share have grown at a much higher rate \u2013 from $2.27 in 2004 to $15.16 in 2023, for an average annual growth of nearly 10%. This is nearly twice the rate of total net income.\n\nWhile growth in total net income is important, it's growth in earnings per share that drives stock prices.\n\nParenthetically, it's growth in earnings per share that drives growth in the dividend too. Since 2004, Home Depot's dividend has grown from 33 cents to $8.36, for an average annual growth of more than 17%. This is an almost unheard-of number and, along with sales and earnings growth, has driven Home Depot stock into the stratosphere.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Truthfully, I wasn't sure I'd ever feel the simple glee of ripping open a box and to pull out the latest gadget again.. Then, I purchased the leaf blower that changed my life. Meet: The RYOBI One+ Cordless 18V Blower.\n\n\n\n\n\nRYOBI One+ Blower\n\n$79.00 at\n\nThough I love to garden, I would never call myself someone who loves being out in the yard, especially not when that is actually code for getting sweaty and bug-bitten while clearing leaves or pulling up weeds. I'm all about working smarter, not harder, and usually outsource these responsibilities to a lawn care service. Lately, though, the winter leaf build-up in my small backyard has been getting to me. Last weekend, I was determined to clean them so I could enjoy our patio in peace once the weather warms up. So, I began raking, collecting, and bagging leaves.\n\nThat lasted for an hour. After my fifth bag, I decided there had to be a better way. I'd been on the fence about purchasing a blower before this project started because our yard isn't huge. Frankly, I didn\u2019t want to tire myself out lugging a large gas-powered blower around. In the name of research, though, I took a trip to Home Depot just to see what small blowers they had. My three main criteria were spending no more than $100, choosing a lightweight blower, and ensuring it was battery-operated. And boy did I find the one.\n\nAt just $79, the RYOBI One+ cordless blower is the perfect blend of powerful and compact. It blows at a brisk 90mph and is able to clear 250 cubic-feet-per-minute. The best part, though? It weighs next to nothing, coming in just under 5lbs. Its battery-powered, cordless build also means I can walk around my yard untethered and don't have to fuss with filling it up with gas. The 2Ah battery it comes with works for 10 minutes straight on full power, but like many other RYOBI products, the battery can be swapped out for longer run times, up to around 40 minutes with an 18V 6Ah battery.\n\nFor a beginner who didn't want to deal with complicated tools, this blower was an absolute game-changer. It took me an hour to finish off one corner around our fire pit and potting table. After charging the battery to full power, I finished the rest of the yard in under 10. Plus, it was simply fun to use! No more hours bent over collecting and raking leaves into a trash bag. Now, I could simply blow them into the woods and not worry about them. It was, simply, freeing. And, because the blower is battery-operated, it runs much quieter than a typical leaf blower. On a quiet Saturday afternoon in our neighborhood, I was able to use the blower and play my podcast at a reasonable, neighborly volume with no problem. Truthfully, I can't wait for fall to come around again so I can blow all the leave in our yard on a regular, weekly basis.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Criticizes Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to warn users to not trust billionaires. His remarks built on an earlier show, where he had shared that \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Cramer outlined that billionaires often share the sentiment that it\u2019s hard for others to become as rich as they are. \u201cThey close the door,\u201d he commented and added: \u201cWell they\u2019re always negative.\u201d Cramer also believes that luck might play a large role in making someone a billionaire. According to him: \u201cWe never, we never grade them because if they\u2019re billionaires we think that they have to be genius. We never think about luck. We just think, well they might have had really great trade.\u201d\n\nIn response, co-host David Faber pointed out that the one key trait that he has observed in most billionaires is their relentless drive. Cramer responded by sharing that billionaires are \u201ctiresome.\u201d He also felt that President Biden\u2019s goodbye speech about oligarchs was \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, Cramer also commented on how using ChatGPT was proving troublesome. He outlined:\n\n\u201cI use ChatGPT like, probably maybe fifty times a day. I do it text and I\u2019m continually let down by the lack of rigor of what I get. I mean I\u2019ll say tell me everything I need to know about [a pharma company \u2013 BMY]. And it won\u2019t even have the patent cliff. Doesn\u2019t mention the patent. . . I mean it just doesn\u2019t get the story at all.\u201d \u201cWell no, you have to know, the key thing about I think about all these sites is you have to know how to put the question. Give me the pluses and minuses of [BMY], was the actual inquiry. And I just find that, it\u2019s just not rigorous. I mean you can\u2019t rely on it. You have to go to all the different sites. You know I go to. Claude-3 a lot. I\u2019d rather go to Claude Rains than Claude-3.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 26th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 88\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that Cramer often discusses on his morning show. His remarks have primarily covered the firm\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report which sent the shares 2.8%. During its fourth quarter, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) grew its same-store sales by 0.8% which signaled to investors that the situation in the home improvement market wasn\u2019t as bad as feared. However, for 2025, the firm forecast a 2% profit-per-share drop which was opposite of analyst estimates of a 4.7% growth. Here is what Cramer said about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD):\n\n\u201cWe had good pro numbers from Home Depot, good pro numbers from Lowe\u2019s, something could be on here David. It is not as bad as feared. These two companies are excellent.\u201d \u201c. . and their [Home Depot] numbers were good, in this environment. Now you gotta look, if you looked at Home Depot, or this, I mean, look everyone was, there was a lot of short money betting against these. I think that when you have a stock that goes down like this you should rethink. But I liked, I liked them. And the Home Depot team, Ted Decker, look these teams, remember these guys take a lot of share too from the mom\u2019s . . .there\u2019s still mom and pop hardware stores that they take. And remember, you\u2019re betting against now they\u2019re Christmas Season, which is going to be, the garden season. Appliances still bad every where.\u201d\n\nOverall, HD ranks 12th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has been experiencing a multiyear slowdown. Its latest earnings report and commentary from the earnings call suggest that Home Depot will not see a recovery in the housing market or home improvement projects anytime soon.\n\nHere's why the retailer is a useful barometer for consumer spending and the housing market and why Home Depot, despite being in a cyclical slowdown, is still a dividend stock that is worth buying now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA person puts their hands over their mouth and looks at a computer in a fearful manner.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nHome Depot's growth has ground to a halt\n\nWith a market cap of more than $390 billion, Home Depot is one of the most valuable retail companies in the world. However, unlike other massive retailers like Walmart or Costco Wholesale, Home Depot is unique because it caters to consumers, professional customers, and contractors. Given the relationship between home improvement spending and the housing market, Home Depot can also provide a valuable gauge of the health of consumer spending across discretionary categories.\n\nHome Depot has been slowing for a variety of reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled forward sales as consumers ramped up spending on do-it-yourself projects. Then came supply chain issues, inflation, and rising interest rates.\n\nRelatively high mortgage interest rates have contributed to low existing home sales and relatively unaffordable housing -- which slowed Home Depot's performance.\n\nBut this quarter, Home Depot broke a two-year streak of declining same-store sales -- a positive sign that the worst of the slowdown may be over. The bad news is that Home Depot provided a bleak outlook for fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nA recovery is not around the corner\n\nHome Depot expects comparable sales growth of just 1% in fiscal 2025 and 2.8% total sales growth, driven partly by the opening of approximately 13 new stores. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decline by 3%, with adjusted diluted EPS down 2%. Operating margins are expected to be 13%, with adjusted operating margins of 13.4%.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, this forecast would give Home Depot its lowest operating margin in more than eight years, while its revenue and earnings have been flatlining or slightly declining for more than two years.\n\nHD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nHD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nConsumer spending has so far held fast\n\nOn the earnings call, Home Depot management provided useful insights into the health of the consumer and the housing market.\n\nRichard McPhail, Home Depot CFO, said the following on the call:\n\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect the underlying momentum in the business that we saw in the back half of 2024 to continue into 2025. However, we are not assuming any meaningful changes to the macroeconomic environment. We expect our consumer will remain healthy. We are not assuming a change in the rate environment nor improvements in housing turnover. As a result, we would expect continued pressure on larger remodeling projects.\n\nTed Decker, Home Depot CEO, said the following in response to an analyst question on the housing market and mortgage rates:\n\nAt this point, while we've seen a little life in turnover in Q4, we're not expecting meaningful increase off that 40-year low. We've likely reached the bottom of housing turnover at about 3% of units, but we're not expecting a big rebound nor significant increases in new housing starts. However, if you just step back, I mean, if you look at our customer, they remain very healthy. So our customer is very healthy. We look at our customer today, we think about $110,000 average income. Those incomes have been growing. We've talked about the increase in home equity values, up 50% since the end of '19, and then wealth effect through the stock market and other investments. So our customer is very healthy. And as you say, if they're staying in their homes longer, they will take on larger remodeling projects as opposed to moving, those that are locked into lower interest rates or just not wanting to get mortgages with the higher rates. But we're not anticipating a large decrease in mortgage rates. It will be more an issue of consumers getting used to these higher rates.\n\nIn sum, consumers have been impressively resilient, even when facing higher interest rates. But the housing market has reached a noteworthy slowdown, which is having ripple effects to home improvement.\n\nThe wealth effect is also worth pointing out. As Home Depot's CEO said, home equity values are up. Because of that, along with a strong period in the stock market, investors are generally wealthier. The problem is that folks who haven't benefited from those trends are even more strained -- making goods, services, and especially big-ticket items like a home or renovation project more expensive.\n\nHome Depot is still worth buying and holding\n\nHome Depot's weak guidance and management's commentary on the earnings call may lead some investors to run for the exits on Home Depot stock. But glass-half-full investors will appreciate how honest management was on the call, choosing to tell the situation how it is rather than overpromising that a recovery is near.\n\nAs the undisputed industry leader in the U.S. home improvement industry (with stores across Canada, Mexico, and other countries as well), Home Depot is well positioned to endure the current slowdown. It sports 16 consecutive years of dividend raises, a 2.3% dividend yield, and a reasonable (but not cheap) valuation.\n\nAdd it all up, and Home Depot is still a solid long-term buy, even if the business doesn't return to growth for at least another year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "It's no secret that Home Depot's (HD -4.19%) prospects are guided by home improvement spending, which is led by the housing market. As such, many investors buy into the stock to play an improving housing market in an environment of, hopefully, lower interest rates. Still, if you are making that assumption, there are plenty of other ways to play the theme, and they offer potentially more upside. Here's a look at why Whirlpool (WHR -2.71%), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK -2.17%), and Owens Corning (OC -3.36%) might be better buys.\n\nValuations still matter\n\nHome Depot is a fine and worthy stock and trades on a 2.4% dividend yield, which provides some helpful income. It also has an excellent position in its end markets, and the $18.25 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution makes sense as it expands its presence with the residential professional customer. It trades on a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 26 times trailing earnings and 23.5 times estimated earnings in 2027.\n\nAs such, it's fair to say that if you think the stock has significant upside potential from here, you are probably pricing in some upside surprise to earnings from an improving housing market.\n\nThe assumption of an improving housing market is fair enough, but the following housing-related stocks seem like a better value. Before going into more detail, note that the analyst consensus is for Whirlpool and Owens Corning's earnings to decline in 2025 (which is why their PE ratios are shown rising) before returning to growth in 2026. Meanwhile, Stanley Black & Decker's expected growth primarily comes down to its cost-cutting measures -- management's base case scenario calls for sales in 2025 to be flat on 2024.\n\nThat said, Wall Street estimates for Home Depot aren't much better. The consensus calls for 1% earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2025, followed by 10% in 2026.\n\nCompany 2024 PE Ratio 2025 PE Ratio* 2026 PE Ratio* Whirlpool 8.1 times 10.2 times 8.7 times Stanley Black & Decker 19.3 times 16 times 12.8 times Owens Corning 9.3 times 10.1 times 9.1 times\n\nWhirlpool: More risk, more reward\n\nThe market is offering more reward for these three stocks to compensate for more risk, and there's little doubt they carry significant risk.\n\nStarting with Whirlpool, a company with a market cap of $5.6 billion and $6.6 billion in net debt, of which $1.85 billion is maturing in 2025. Management plans to pay down $700 million of that debt this year and refinance $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of the remaining maturing debt while maintaining its dividend, costing $384 million.\n\nThe plan is backed by its expectation to generate $500 million to $600 million in free cash in 2025, while potentially receiving $550 million to $600 million from reducing its stake in Whirlpool India from 51% to 20%.\n\nThe plan could run into trouble if end market conditions deteriorate in 2025, and Whirlpool's launch of more than 100 new products (including a complete product redesign of KitchenAid) fails to generate the sales and profit margin management expect.\n\nStanley Black & Decker is on the right track\n\nWhile Whirlpool failed to meet its initial 2024 guidance for sales, margin, and cash flow, Stanley Black & Decker met all of its key guidance metrics last year, as the company builds on its recovery plan to cut costs and expand profit margin while reorganizing its supply chain, sourcing, and manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe plan is working, but there are a couple of concerns. The first is its still historically high inventory-to-sales ratio, as weak sales make it harder to reduce inventory. There's also a concern about the potential for tariff actions to add to its cost base as they did the last time President Donald Trump was in office.\n\nOwens Corning doubles down on housing\n\nWhereas Whirlpool appears to be reacting to events rather than leading them, and Stanley Black & Decker is fundamentally restructuring, Owens Corning is definitely leading proactively. The roofing, insulation, and composites company doubled down on the residential housing market in North America with its $3.9 billion acquisition of doors company Masonite last year.\n\nThe deal adds a complementary product to its sales operation and allows management to generate cost synergies as part of the deal.\n\nWhile the full benefit of the deal won't shine through until the residential repair and remodeling and housing starts activity picks up, Owens Corning is a company with adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 25% and one that generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in a weak market last year.\n\nThat solidity protects the downside from potential housing weakness while offering investors a significant upside if the housing market recovers.\n\nStocks to buy?\n\nWhirlpool, Stanley Black & Decker, and Owens Corning all look like better values than Home Depot right now. Whirlpool is a stock for more speculative investors, meaning those who like high risk/high reward, while Stanley Black & Decker is on the right track, but still has some unknowns around tariffs and inventory reduction. Of the four stocks discussed here, Owens Corning looks the best placed on a risk/reward basis, at least for investors looking to play an eventual housing market recovery.",

            "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date, which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves a full business day. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Home Depot's shares before the 13th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$2.30 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$9.20 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Home Depot has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current stock price of US$376.80. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Home Depot\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Home Depot paid out 61% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 55% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:HD Historic Dividend March 8th 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Home Depot, with earnings per share up 7.7% on average over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Home Depot has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.",

Read on to find out if any of these cards are right for your wallet!\n\nThe Home Depot Personal Cards at a Glance\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card The Home Depot Project Loan Main Benefits 6 months financing on purchases of $299+\n\nUp to 24 months financing\n\nduring special promotions\n\nduring special promotions Special discount offers\n\n1-year returns\n\n$0 liability for unauthorized\n\ncharges\n\ncharges Sign-up bonus for new accounts Credit lines up to $55,000\n\n6-month buying window\n\n84 months to pay off purchases (no pre-payment penalty) Annual Fee $0 $0 APR 17.99%, 21.99%, 25.99%, or 26.99%,\n\nbased on creditworthiness 4 tiers with term and APR subject to qualifying credit approval: 66 monthly payments at 7.42%\n\n78 monthly payments at 12.86%\n\n90 monthly payments at 16.24%\n\n114 monthly payments at 19.96% Late Fee Up to $40 Up to $40\n\nAt first glance, these cards both look like typical credit cards, but you should be aware of some major differences. Let\u2019s dig into the specifics.\n\nThe Home Depot Card\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot\n\nThe Home Depot card is a store-branded card issued by Citibank. Of the 2 personal cards offered, this one is more like a traditional credit card. However, you can only use it for purchases at The Home Depot.\n\nThis card is geared toward individuals who make fairly regular medium-sized purchases and can benefit from special financing.\n\nHot Tip: You don\u2019t earn any rewards with this card. It does not earn cash-back, points, or miles. So if you\u2019re not looking for to use special financing, you\u2019re likely better off with a card that will earn rewards on these purchases. Find more tips below in the Alternative Rewards-Based Credit Cards section.\n\nAdvertised benefits of this card are:\n\n6 months financing on purchases of $299+\n\nUp to 24 months financing during special promotions\n\nSpecial discount offers\n\n1-year no-hassle returns (4x longer than a non-cardmember)\n\n$0 liability on unauthorized charges\n\nCitibank also gives you the ability to see if you pre-qualify for this card without impacting your credit score.\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot\n\nNew accounts may also be eligible for a sign-up discount when making a qualified purchase.\n\nBottom Line: While many of these benefits could certainly come in handy, they aren\u2019t extraordinary perks by any means.\n\nThe Home Depot Card Special Financing Offers\n\nNot everyone has the funds to make large purchases outright. A lack of upfront funding is where special financing can come in handy. With The Home Depot card, you have plenty of special financing options.\n\nThe Home Depot\u2019s primary special financing offer is:\n\n6-month everyday financing on purchases of $299+\n\nAdditionally, The Home Depot gives cardholders the opportunity to secure limited-time-only special financing offers. Examples of options that The Home Depot has offered or currently offers include:\n\n12 months financing on any installed heating and air conditioning purchase of $299+\n\nUp to 18 months financing on installed bath purchases\n\n24 months financing on a RainSoft Installed Water Treatment\n\n24 months financing on an installed cabinet makeover, installed countertops, and backsplash purchases\n\nThese financing offers allow cardholders to pay off their balance with no interest if paid in full within the allotted period. This type of financing offer is called deferred interest.\n\nBut what happens if you don\u2019t pay off your balance on time?\n\nKnow Your Terms and Conditions: What is Deferred Interest?\n\nAny time you take advantage of a special financing offer, you should be explicitly aware of the terms and conditions. There is a BIG difference between \u201cno interest for 6 months\u201d and \u201cno interest if paid in full within 6 months.\u201d The latter indicates you\u2019ll be subject to deferred interest. In The Home Depot\u2019s case, almost all of their special financing offers have deferred interest.\n\nWith deferred interest, if you pay off your purchase in full within the promotional period, no interest will be applied. However (and it\u2019s a big however), if you do not pay off your balance in full, interest charges will be imposed on the starting balance at the APR for regular purchases retroactively from the date of purchase.\n\nThe regular purchase APR is the rate assigned to your account based on your creditworthiness; you can find it in your card agreement terms.\n\nBottom Line: Charges can easily add up if you don\u2019t pay off your balances on time, especially if you have many purchases that are being paid off under a deferred interest special financing promotion. Your balance can grow even faster if your assigned APR is on the high side.\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan is meant for individuals who are tackling a hefty project, like kitchen and bath remodels, room additions, or roof replacements. While it is technically a Mastercard, it is not a traditional credit card. Instead, this is a card you use to access funds from a consumer loan that has been extended to you by Home Depot Loan Services via GreenSky, LLC.\n\nYou can only use the card at The Home Depot and homedepot.com, including Home Services.\n\nWhy Is This Card So Popular? What Does It Give Me?\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan gives cardholders an extremely large line of credit (up to $55,000), 6 months to make purchases, and up to 9.5 years to pay it all off.\n\nIf you\u2019re spending a sizeable amount of money on a large renovation, add-on, or new build, this offer can sound very enticing and has benefits for the right user. Just make sure you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into before choosing this card option.\n\nCredit Line up to $55,000\n\nCardholders use this little piece of plastic to access a line of credit or funds from a previously-approved consumer loan.\n\nYour first step on the application is to request your loan amount, typically the amount you have estimated it will cost to complete your home project. The Home Depot Project Loan allows for loans from $2,500 to $55,000.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s good practice to request only what you think you need. However, a budget for renovations can be difficult to determine at times. If you end up spending less than the credit limit assigned at loan approval, you\u2019re only responsible for the amount spent during the 6-month purchasing window.\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan is an unsecured loan, meaning no collateral is required. Unsecured status is critical to consider because it means approval for the loan is based mainly on your credit score, your debt ratio, whether or not you own your home, why you need the loan, and potentially a few additional factors.\n\nIf you request a massive credit line but don\u2019t have the financial profile to back up the loan, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be approved.\n\n6-Month Purchasing Window\n\nOnce approved for the loan, you will have a 6-month purchasing window to buy items and supplies.\n\nFixed Low Monthly Payments\n\nAPR is where prospective cardholders should do some quick math before blindly hopping on board.\n\nThe loan has 4 tiers with term and APR subject to qualifying credit approval:\n\n66 monthly payments at 7.42%\n\n78 monthly payments at 12.86%\n\n90 monthly payments at 16.24%\n\n114 monthly payments at 19.96%\n\nThe Home Depot states that \u201cmonthly payments will not exceed $20 per $1000 spent (e.g., $160 per month for an $8000 purchase).\u201d\n\nThey offer an example of what your fixed monthly payments would equate to for some popular loan amounts:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Loan Amount Monthly Payments ($20 per $1,000 Borrowed) $1,000 $20 $5,000 $100 $10,000 $200 $25,000 $500 $35,000 $700 $55,000 $1,100\n\nWhat they don\u2019t show in the table above is how much you\u2019ll pay in interest across those monthly payments. We\u2019ve calculated a few of them for you in the table below using the lowest tier of 66 monthly payments at 7.42%.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Loan Amount 66 Monthly Payments Total Paid Amount Paid Over Original Balance $1,000 $20 $1,320 $320 $5,000 $100 $6,600 $1,600 $10,000 $200 $13,200 $3,200 $25,000 $500 $33,000 $8,000 $35,000 $700 $46,200 $11,200 $55,000 $1,100 $72,600 $17,600\n\nAn important distinction: this total is the entire amount you would end up paying if you let the payments stretch out over the full 66 months (5.5 years).\n\nHowever, The Home Depot does not apply a penalty for paying off your loan early.\n\nYou see where we\u2019re going with this.\n\nBottom Line: If you\u2019re fairly confident you can make more than the minimum payments each month or chip away at your balance with some extra payments over time to pay off your loan in full faster than the full repayment period, The Home Depot Project Loan could be a useful card.\n\nIf you consider paying more than the original balance an unfortunate, yet unavoidable, premium necessary to get your project done, then The Home Depot Project Loan could be worth it for you.\n\nThe Home Depot Business Cards at a Glance\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE The Home Depot Commercial Account\n\nThe Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge Card Main Benefits 60 days with no interest on every purchase\n\nPro Xtra membership\n\nFuel savings\n\n1-year returns\n\nSign-up bonus for new accounts\n\nBuyer ID cards (up to 4) 60 days with no interest on every purchase\n\nPro Xtra membership\n\nFuel savings\n\n1-year returns\n\nSign-up bonus for new accounts\n\nAuthorized user cards (up to 4) Annual Fee $0 $0 APR N/A; payments due in full each month 21.99% (15% in GA or NC) Late Fee Up to $35 Up to $40\n\nFor professionals, the commercial card and account offer similar benefits \u2014 deciding which product is right for you depends on your payment flexibility. Let\u2019s first review the shared benefits.\n\nPro Xtra: Pro Loyalty Program\n\nPro Xtra is The Home Depot\u2019s loyalty program for professionals. Members receive exclusive benefits, like volume pricing, purchase tracking, paint rewards, and exclusive discounts and offers. Business tools are also available, such as Text2Confirm purchase authorization, reloadable gift cards, and a virtual ID.\n\nFuel Savings\n\nEnroll your commercial card in Fuel Rewards and earn 10\u00a2 per gallon for every $100 of qualifying purchases at The Home Depot.\n\nAt participating Shell and other select gas stations, your fuel price will drop when you swipe your card at the pump (limited to 20 gallons of fuel per purchase per vehicle).\n\nPurchase Itemization\n\nYour monthly billing statement contains an itemization of all purchases made on your commercial account or card. Purchases can be tracked by the buyer or job name, job number, or purchase order.\n\n60 Days With No Interest on Every Purchase\n\nLastly, both the commercial card and account offer the option of 30- or 60-day payment terms. If your business does not have enough credit history to establish a commercial account, particularly with young or small companies, you may give a personal guarantee. In the event that the company defaults on payment, you will be held personally liable for all obligations and amounts due.\n\nThe Home Depot Commercial Account functions more like a charge card than a credit card. There is no set APR or minimum monthly payment as you are expected to pay your balance in full each billing cycle.\n\nThe Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge Card actually functions more like a credit card. Minimum monthly payments are required and you will incur interest on the unpaid balance after the 60-day period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFees and Drawbacks of The Home Depot Credit Cards\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed many of the fees and drawbacks associated with each card, but we\u2019ll compare them here.\n\nFees\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Personal Business The Home Depot Card The Home Depot Project Loan The Home Depot Commercial Account The Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge Card Annual Fee $0 $0 $0 $0 Purchase APR 17.99%, 21.99%, 25.99%, or 26.99%,\n\nbased on creditworthiness 4 tiers with term and APR subject to qualifying credit approval: 66 monthly payments at 7.42%\n\n78 monthly payments at 12.86%\n\n90 monthly payments at 16.24%\n\n114 monthly payments at 19.96% N/A; payments due in full each month 21.99% (15% in GA or NC) Minimum Interest Charge $2 undisclosed N/A $1 Late Fee Up to $40 Up to $40 Up to $35 Up to $40 Returned Payment Fee Up to $40 undisclosed undisclosed undisclosed\n\nGenerally, you can easily access the terms and conditions for all credit cards, but since The Home Depot Project Loan isn\u2019t a traditional credit card, the terms and conditions for the card are not easily accessible online and may not be available over the phone, either.\n\nWhen calling the customer service number dedicated to The Home Depot Project Loan customers, the representative was able to share information for the late fee, but was less clear about the returned payment fee, stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t charge a returned payment fee, but some banks do.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that means you can\u2019t review all of the terms and conditions until you\u2019re approved and review your loan approval paperwork.\n\nHot Tip: The best way to avoid charges and fees is to be a responsible cardholder by paying off your balance in full each month. If you can\u2019t pay it off in full (which is why you probably got a special financing card), pay as much as you can. At the very least, always pay the minimum amount on time.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThese are the main drawbacks for The Home Depot cards:\n\nYou can only use these cards at The Home Depot and homedepot.com\n\nYou won\u2019t earn any rewards (cash-back or rewards points)\n\nHefty APRs on The Home Depot card can become troublesome if you carry a balance\n\nThe Home Depot Commercial Account requires payment in full each month\n\nWe won\u2019t even get into what happens if you default on The Home Depot Project Loan.\n\nApplying for The Home Depot Personal and Business Cards\n\nCustomers can apply for either of The Home Depot cards in person at a Home Depot store or online.\n\nIf applying online, you\u2019ll be redirected to a Citibank application page.\n\nImage Credit: Citibank\n\nIf you\u2019re applying online, you\u2019ll be redirected to a THD Loan/GreenSky application page.\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot Project Loan\n\nSimply fill out the appropriate forms and submit your application.\n\nIf you decide to apply in person, a Home Depot employee will assist you in submitting your application and walk you through any questions you may have.\n\nThe Home Depot Business Cards\n\nWhen applying online for either commercial option, you\u2019ll be directed to a Citibank page that asks for information about your company as well as personal details. You may apply with a personal guarantor for The Home Depot Commercial Account.\n\nImage Credit: Citibank\n\nThere is the option to select 30- or 60-day payment terms, and you can also enroll in the Fuel Rewards program and select your number of program cards (up to 4).\n\nCredit Scores\n\nThe Home Depot Card\n\nMost credit card review sites report a fair credit score is needed to qualify for the card.\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan\n\nThings are a bit more complicated with this card. While your credit score is a significant factor in this decision, it\u2019s also possible the decision depends on other factors such as whether or not you own your home, your debt-to-income ratio, and the reason you need the loan (among other factors).\n\nHowever, the consensus from other card review sites is that you should have at least a fair credit score to consider applying.\n\nRemember that each application is unique. There are reports of denials for high credit scores and approvals for bottom-range fair scores.\n\nThe Home Depot Commercial Account is best for those with fair credit. The Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge Card is slightly harder to qualify for and would require a good credit score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLog-In and Online Account Management\n\nThe Home Depot Card and Commercial Accounts\n\nCardholders of The Home Depot card can manage their account online through an online portal. Similarly, users of The Home Depot Commercial Account and The Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge card have similar portals.\n\nImage Credit: Citibank\n\nThis account management portal allows cardholders to perform the following actions:\n\nView account activity\n\nView billing statements\n\nSet up paperless statements and e-communications\n\nMake a payment\n\nGet exclusive offers\n\nActivate account alerts\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan\n\nCardholders can manage their Home Depot Project Loan online through a different portal.\n\nImage Credit: The Home Depot Project Loan\n\nThis account management portal allows cardholders to perform the following actions:\n\nCheck account status\n\nMake payments\n\nEnroll in automatic payments\n\nRequest a payoff\n\nRequest copies of loan documents\n\nAlternative Rewards-Based Credit Cards (Our Recommendations)\n\nThe average purchase price at a retailer like The Home Depot is larger than at most other stores. Higher checkout amounts are 1 reason The Home Depot offers solutions with affordable APRs.\n\nHowever, many rewards cards have 0% APR for up to 18 months which could be an attractive alternative, especially if you don\u2019t need to spend tens of thousands of dollars (as that amount might require a higher credit limit).\n\nIf you\u2019d like the ability to earn on purchases other than just home improvement, consider rewards-earning credit cards that offer flexible redemption options.\n\nThese are some of our favorite rewards credit card alternatives that come with generous cash welcome bonuses:\n\nChase Freedom Flex\u00ae U.P.

When developing your strategy to maximize rewards from your business purchases, our helpful guide may come in handy.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThese cards each have their benefits and drawbacks.\n\nThe Home Depot card might be a good card for you if you need special financing options for everyday home purchases. However, there are many other (more popular) cards out there that provide similar special financing and can give you rewards benefits at the same time. Remember, you can only use The Home Depot card at The Home Depot, and you won\u2019t earn any rewards for doing so.\n\nThe Home Depot Project Loan could be helpful if you\u2019re completing a big project and don\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay for everything upfront. This card could potentially give you a credit line of up to $55,000 and you\u2019ll also get a 6-month purchasing window with low payments stretched out over 66 to 114 months at an APR of 7.42% to 19.96%.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good interest rate if you\u2019re extending payments for a little while, but if you\u2019re planning to let them drag out over 114 months, you\u2019ll end up paying much more than the original loan amount. Still, some may see this as a necessary hurdle to get the project accomplished. If you do choose this card, we recommend that you pay off the loan as soon as possible to avoid hefty cumulative charges.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re looking for a cash-back card or a travel rewards credit card to help you earn points or miles, this card isn\u2019t for you.\n\nFor commercial construction or home improvement professionals, the business card and account can be useful to those with heavy spending at The Home Depot. Cardmembers receive discounts, special pricing, and exclusive member-only benefits. If your business spending is spread out across multiple categories and merchants, you may want a business card that rewards more of those purchases.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Home Depot on Tuesday named Michael Rowe executive vice president of Pro, effective immediately. He reports to Ann-Marie Campbell, a senior executive vice president who oversees operations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nA 19-year veteran of the company, Rowe most recently served as president of The Home Depot Canada. His past experience with the chain\u2019s Canada business includes stints as vice president of online, marketing and contractor services, as well as vice president of finance and contractor services, procurement and strategic business development.\n\nThe company also announced the promotions of Vinod Nalajala to replace Rowe as president of The Home Depot Canada, effective immediately, and Stephanie Smith to succeed current Executive Vice President of Human Resources Tim Hourigan upon his retirement from the chain on June 6. Nalajala also reports to Campbell, per the company.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nRowe\u2019s appointment comes as the chain continues to beef up its pro business.\n\nThe retailer opened four new distribution centers in the first half of last year in Detroit, Los Angeles, San Antonio and Toronto to better serve its pro customers. The retailer stocked the facilities with large, bulky merchandise such as lumber, insulation and roofing shingles.\n\n\"We are uniquely positioned to win as we build out our Pro ecosystem, investing in capabilities to grow share of wallet with Pros no matter how they choose to shop with us,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in a statement. \"As the head of our Canadian business, Mike led an unprecedented period of growth and expansion across the country and was instrumental in building our Pro business in Canada. His vision and operational expertise make him an ideal fit to lead our Pro business through its next phase of growth, alongside our talented Pro organization.\"\n\nHome Depot is coming off a fourth quarter where it posted positive quarterly comparable sales for the first time in two years, inching up 0.8% overall and 1.3% in the U.S. All pro cohorts saw positive comps during the fourth quarter as well, according to the company. While the retailer believes the positive results bode well for 2025, it remains cautious in its projections given the current economic conditions of pending tariffs and high interest rates.\n\nLike Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s has also been ramping up its initiatives to win over pro customers. The retailer just last month announced a simplified loyalty program that makes it easier for small- and mid-sized professional contractors to earn and redeem rewards.",

Home Depot started rolling out Magic Apron to its main website, homedepot.com, and its app in recent months. The AI concierge can be found in a chat bar on millions of product pages.\n\nHome Depot has used AI at scale on its website for a decade, said Jordan Broggi, executive vice president of customer experience and president of the company's online operations.\n\nThe company now uses generative AI to produce text and visual content. Magic Apron goes further. It can answer detailed questions about hardware and other merchandise, summarize product reviews and give project recommendations.\n\n\"Magic Apron is a subset of generative AI, and for us it is our version of bringing that aproned associate experience that customers love in the aisles of our store into the digital aisles,\" Broggi said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nHome Depot joins the ranks of companies rolling out AI-powered tools to help assist customers. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines has also used AI as part of its website for years. In January, the carrier announced its Delta Concierge chatbot to help enhance and further personalize online customer service.\n\nBroggi said Magic Apron's model has been trained using Home Depot's proprietary knowledge and its product catalog. He said company experts and Home Depot data scientists have helped teach the model to refine its answers.\n\nIn stores, conversations between customers and Home Depot associates often start with merchandise. With some questioning by associates, those conversations evolve into project discussions. Broggi said that's the intent with Magic Apron.\n\nAn Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter inquired with the chatbot about staining a deck, including the types of stains one might use and how many coats to apply.\n\nThe chatbot provided a listing of stains by type and information about the preferred frequency of application by product. It also displayed information about how to prepare the work site and steps for applying different types of stains.\n\n\"It has a contextual understanding of where you are,\" Broggi said.\n\nHome Depot will soon roll out the AI tool to its website for professionals, with guidance tailored to contractors and other business customers.\n\nIn a news release, Home Depot said additional functions will be added, including \"project inspiration, design ideas, product comparison and recommendations.\"\n\nUltimately, the Home Depot concierge will gain the capability of remembering past discussions and order histories to better understand customers' needs, Broggi said.\n\n2025 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

(NYSE:HD) stands against other companies that just raised their dividends.\n\nDividend stocks have been attracting investor interest for quite some time, consistently delivering strong performances that highlight their long-term appeal. This growing investor preference has led many major technology companies to introduce dividend payments. As a result, dividends are no longer limited to traditional value stocks, with growth-oriented firms also emerging as significant dividend payers.\n\nHistorical trends show that dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed other asset classes across various market cycles. A report from T. Rowe Price highlights that dividends have made up nearly one-third of total equity returns for US stocks since 1926. During the period from 1980 to 2019, which saw a decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the broader market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nBy the end of September 2024, approximately 80% of companies in the broader market were distributing dividends\u2014a proportion that has remained relatively steady over the past decade. Notably, the technology sector represented nearly 24% of dividend-paying companies, a significant rise from 13% ten years ago. Other industries, such as healthcare and industrials, also experienced an uptick in firms offering dividends. This broader availability of dividend-paying stocks has provided income-focused investors with more opportunities to gain exposure to high-growth and innovative businesses. Given these developments, analysts maintain a positive outlook for dividend stocks as they head into 2025.\n\nDividend growth is closely tied to a strong earnings season. In February, the broader market struggled, declining by over 2% as concerns about inflation, upcoming tariffs under former President Donald Trump, and escalating geopolitical tensions weighed on investor sentiment. On February 28, the major index briefly dipped into negative territory for 2025. However, corporate earnings reports for the fourth quarter have provided a fresh catalyst for the market.\n\nAs of February 28, nearly 97% of companies in the broader market had reported earnings, with over 75% surpassing analyst expectations, according to FactSet. Many of these companies delivered encouraging news for income-focused investors. In the week ending February 25, data from JPMorgan showed that 20 companies announced dividend increases, with no reports of dividend cuts or suspensions during that period. This is positive for income investors, as dividend growth is always a welcomed development for them.",

In addition, the retailer also plans to employ the technology to help professional contractors and business account customers.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s professional customer base has become increasingly important as sales to do-it-yourself users have slipped in recent quarters.\n\nBroggi said during the company\u2019s earnings call that online and pro consumers were benefiting from an improved site experience from a browsing and search perspective.\n\n\u201cAll those investments are coming together to drive an improvement in conversion rates and increased engagement across channels,\u201d Broggi said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the momentum there and excited about the investments we\u2019ve made there.\u201d\n\nAs noted here at the time, the company\u2019s focus on omnichannel shoppers could hold promise. After all, research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows nearly 40% of consumers are now click-and-mortar shoppers, searching for products through both digital and physical channels.\n\n\u201cFor these shoppers, the physical store serves as an extension of their online experiences,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Home Depot is just one of many retailers embracing AI. For example grocery chain Aldi recently announced it would begin using Digital Wave Technology\u2019s generative AI solutions in the U.S. to automate the creation of product copy and product attribution.\n\nA little more than three-quarters of business leaders rank generative AI as the most impactful emerging technology, according to research from the PYMNTS Intelligence and AI-ID collaboration, \u201cWhat Generative AI Has in Store for the Retail Industry.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that marketing and sales functions are leading generative AI efforts at 16% of consumer and retail companies, with 57% of marketing and sales teams pursuing GenAI initiatives compared to 31% of departments in other industries.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

            "content": "Costco (COST -3.93%) and Home Depot (HD -4.19%) are two leading retailers that investors are surely familiar with. They have strong industry positions within their specific verticals, whether it's general merchandise or home improvement. Over the decades, they've done a great job rewarding shareholders.\n\nOf these two retail stocks, which is the better one to buy right now?\n\nCostco is a consumer favorite\n\nIt really doesn't matter what type of economic environment we're in. Costco's financial performance shows that it can succeed regardless of external factors. This is evident when looking at one key performance metric.\n\nThe business reported 5.9% same-store sales (SSS) growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1, 2024). This was at least the 10th straight year that Costco posted a positive figure. Top rivals, like Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club, don't have this type of stellar track record. It points to the durable demand that Costco faces, which supports higher foot traffic and ticket sizes.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Nov. 24, 2024), the company raked in $61 billion in net sales. This massive sum makes Costco the world's third-biggest retailer, and gives it a powerful scale advantage.\n\nThe typical Costco warehouse carries 4,000 stock-keeping units, far fewer than other supermarkets. It buys huge quantities of merchandise from its suppliers, which results in bargaining power. Favorable input costs lead to lower prices for customers. It's a positive feedback loop that's hard to slow down.\n\nHigh-quality goods and lower prices should be enough to delight customers. However, Costco has figured out a way to drive repeat purchase behavior and loyalty. Its shoppers must pay annual fees to be members and have the right to visit its warehouses. Membership fee income totaled $4.8 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nHome Depot leads the home improvement industry\n\nHome Depot isn't on as strong a footing as Costco. In the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Feb. 2, 2024), the business reported just a 0.8% rise in SSS. On the positive, this was the first increase after Home Depot posted eight straight quarterly declines. CEO Ted Decker continues to point to \"uncertain macroeconomic conditions in a higher interest rate environment that impacted home improvement demand.\"\n\nHopefully, the situation will improve soon, as the outlook calls for 1% SSS growth in fiscal 2025. However, the strategy of improving the customer experience, driving greater spending from professionals, and opening new stores hasn't changed.\n\nDespite its struggles to boost growth, Home Depot benefits from a favorable industry backdrop. Management says there are trillions of dollars in untapped home equity in the U.S., particularly as home prices have risen considerably in the past five years. That means there's a lot of liquidity to take on renovation projects once consumer demand improves.\n\nThe median age of a home in the U.S. was 40 years in 2022, a figure that continues to increase. Older houses require more upkeep, supporting demand for what Home Depot sells.\n\nThere's also a large housing shortage in the U.S. In other words, homeowners are incentivized to invest in upgrading their current dwellings rather than moving. Again, this supports Home Depot's success.\n\nValuation matters\n\nAs of this writing (March 3), shares of Home Depot trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.3. That's 16% higher than its 10-year average. At first glance, this doesn't look like an appealing proposition.\n\nCostco, on the other hand, trades at a P/E multiple of 62. The stock has never been more expensive in its entire public history, which spans almost four decades.\n\nCostco is the better business. But the better investment opportunity is strikingly clear. Of these two dominant retailers, Home Depot is more deserving of your capital right now.",

            "content": "Persistent inflation is putting pressure on consumer spending, leading to shifts in purchasing habits\u2014even for essential goods. This trend is also impacting the stock market. Although inflation has eased, food prices remain considerably higher than in previous years. As a result, Rohr has observed that grocery stores have been lagging behind larger retailers in performance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more pressure on the discretionary side. Consumers are being more cautious with their spending, prioritizing \u2026 essential categories like food and beverage and household essentials.\u201d\n\nIn February, US business activity slowed significantly, driven by growing concerns over import tariffs and substantial reductions in federal government spending. These factors wiped out the gains seen after President Donald Trump's election victory. According to S&P Global, business and consumer sentiment has been increasingly affected by the administration's policies. The firm\u2019s flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which measures both manufacturing and services activity, dropped to 50.4 as of February 22\u2014the lowest level since September 2023\u2014down from 52.7 in January. Since a reading above 50 indicates expansion, this decline suggests a slowdown in private sector growth.\n\nConsumer cyclical companies manufacture goods and services that are considered non-essential, meaning consumers are more likely to spend on them when they have extra income or feel financially secure. This category includes businesses in industries such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.\n\nConsumer spending has been unpredictable for some time, influenced by ongoing economic conditions. Some months see strong growth, while others experience a decline. In November, spending on goods rose by 3.4%, slightly outpacing the 2.8% increase in services. However, in January, US consumer spending declined for the first time in nearly two years. According to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending\u2014which makes up over two-thirds of US economic activity\u2014declined by 0.2% in January. This marked the first drop since March 2023 and was the most significant decline in nearly four years. The decrease followed a stronger-than-expected rise of 0.8% in December, which was initially estimated at 0.7%. At the same time, the goods trade deficit reached a record high as businesses ramped up imports ahead of potential tariffs. These factors suggest the economy may face slower growth or even a downturn this quarter.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other consumer cyclical dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA survey by McKinsey & Company found that, in the first quarter of the year, 46% of US consumers felt optimistic, supported by stable inflation, low unemployment, and steady job growth. However, not everyone shared this outlook. Just over a third expressed mixed feelings about the economy, while pessimism rose slightly from the previous quarter. Interestingly, while stable inflation contributed to optimism, half of the respondents still cited rising prices as their top concern, with older consumers being more worried about inflation than younger ones. The survey also revealed that consumers planned to cut back on spending in many discretionary categories. This suggests that even those with a positive economic outlook, along with those feeling uncertain or pessimistic, may be cautious about their spending habits.\n\nIn 2025, consumer cyclical stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market and more defensive sectors. Since the start of the year, the Consumer Discretionary Index has declined by nearly 8%. However, the sector remains a strong dividend payer. In the third quarter of 2024, companies in this sector distributed nearly $23 billion in dividends, a significant increase from $15.3 billion during the same period in 2023, as reported by Janus Henderson. Over the years, dividend payouts in the sector have steadily grown, rising from $16.4 billion in 2018 to $23 billion in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of S&P's Consumer Discretionary index and identified dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries. These companies are strong dividend payers and have decent yields. From that group, we picked 12 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement company. With operations spanning more than 2,300 locations across North America, the company's performance remains closely linked to trends in the real estate market. While it has continued to experience steady growth and maintain strong profitability, elevated mortgage rates have presented challenges. Higher borrowing costs have led to a decline in home sales and a reduced supply of available properties, which has, in turn, impacted consumer spending on home improvement projects.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported strong fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, with revenue reaching $39.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 14%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, it expects total sales to grow by approximately 2.8%, with comparable sales projected to rise by about 1% over the same 52-week period. Additionally, it plans to open around 13 new stores and anticipates a gross margin of approximately 33.4%.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) ended the quarter with over $1.65 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Throughout fiscal 2024, the company generated nearly $20 billion in operating cash flow, reinforcing its strong financial position. This stability has enabled it to maintain uninterrupted dividend payments for 152 consecutive quarters. Moreover, it increased its quarterly dividend by 2.2% to $2.30 per share, marking the 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of March 4, the stock supports a dividend yield of 2.41%.\n\nOverall HD ranks 1st our list of the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy right now.

He left this world suddenly on Wednesday, March 5, 2025, at age 70, after a brief stay at the Kate B. Reynolds Hospice Home. Mark was preceded in death by both of his parents Richard Stuart Sheppard and Mildred Marie Noah Sheppard. Mark was born on January 21, 1955, in Winston-Salem, NC. He was a graduate of East Forsyth High School and went on to study Economics at both Wingate College and UNCG. During his college years, Mark developed a love for tennis after following the careers of both Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi and even played on his college intramural tennis teams. Mark came from a long line of men that loved fixing things and working with their hands. This passion took him into his career path of maintenance at both Home Depot and Costco Wholesale. Mark worked at Home Depot from 1994 to 2001. After leaving Home Depot, Mark found his dream job at Costco Wholesale where he worked from 2001 until his death in 2025. Mark loved his family and friends, his country and most importantly his relationship with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Faith was an important part of Mark\u2019s life, and it sustained him during his Prostate Cancer journey. Mark found love for Tarheel basketball during the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s while watching his team win many national championships. Mark was loving, kind and compassionate. He was a trusted confidant, mentor and friend to many that knew him, and he will truly be missed. Mark is survived by his sister, Rhonda Sheppard Pepper (Kent), a nephew, Trent Carter: and two uncles, Wayne Noah (Betty) and Bill Sheppard (Sherry). The family would like to express their gratitude to the staff at both Kernersville Medical Center and the Katie B. Reynolds Hospice Home for their professional care given to Mark during his last days of life. Kent, Rhonda and Trent would like to express their heartfelt thanks to Mark\u2019s friends and coworkers at Costco Wholesale for all their love and support shown to the Sheppard family during this difficult time.\n\nA funeral service will be conducted at 2 pm on Wednesday, March 12, 2025, at Hayworth-Miller Rural Hall Chapel with Pastor John Holmes officiating. Interment will follow at Crestview Memorial Park. The family will receive friends from 12:00 to 1:45pm prior to the service at Hayworth Miller Rural Hall Chapel.

            "content": "This is just a tiny glimpse of the data available to CivicScience clients. Discover more data.\n\nThe impending time change and soon-to-come warmer temps often give way to spring and summer projects around the house. But the state of home improvement this year might not exactly be as rosy as the weather as evidenced by both of the major home improvement retailers, Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot, recently sounding the alarm. With the latest tariffs now in effect amid an already dampened economic outlook overall, home improvement projects appear primed for a downturn this year. CivicScience has new data on what home improvement plans might look like in this uncertain and turbulent economic climate.\n\nHome Renovation Intent Drops Significantly\n\nNew CivicScience data through the end of February highlight why retailers are feeling uneasy \u2013 a slim majority (51%) of consumers believe now is a \u2018bad\u2019 time to make a major purchase like home improvements given the state of the economy. This percentage has increased by three percentage points from January. While only 16% believe now is a \u2018good\u2019 time for such purchases, it represents the highest percentage holding this belief since September 2021.\n\n\n\nAs interest rates remain elevated and tariffs hit home, American homeowners are overall less likely to plan on taking on any renovation projects in the next 12 months than they were in 2024. This year, 55% of homeowners have renovation/remodeling projects planned, down from an average of 62% during 2024. This decline is likely to accelerate in the wake of this week\u2019s tariffs. Among those who are undertaking a project, 22% will handle it all themselves, outpacing those relying fully on professionals (18%) and those using a mix of DIY and professional work (15%).\n\nUse this Data: The press, brands, and marketers can use this chart to understand how consumer sentiment on the economy is likely to impact home improvement plans in the months ahead.\n\nAmong those planning home renovations this year, 74% expect to spend $10,000 or less, including 46% staying under $5,000. On the higher end, 13% plan to exceed $20,000, with 4% spending over $60,000. Nearly half (47%) of Home Depot\u2019s customers plan to keep renovation budgets under $5,000 \u2013 six percentage points higher than Lowe\u2019s customers, who are more likely to spend between $5,000-$10,000.\n\nAnswer our Poll: How comfortable are you with DIY home improvement projects?\n\nFinding a Way Forward: Taking on Debt May Be Key to Projects\n\nTaking on home improvement projects can quickly become a pricey venture, which may lead consumers to take on debt to make it happen. New CivicScience data among those planning projects in the next 12 months finds just under one in five (18%) reporting they plan to take on at least some debt to pay for them. Additionally, 37% of respondents taking on debt for imminent home improvements expect to spend $10,000+.\n\nTwenty-one percent of Home Depot\u2019s customers with home improvement project plans this year expect to take on debt to pay for them, outpacing Lowe\u2019s customers by six percentage points (15%).\n\nThe Work They Will Be Doing This Year\n\nPeering through the lens of Americans planning some variation of home improvement projects in the next 12 months reveals priorities that are likely to be comparatively lighter on the budget are most common. Data show landscaping, interior painting, and flooring/carpets are the top three most common projects likely to be in the cards this year. Meanwhile, more extensive work such as adding a pool, hot tub, or spa, an addition, or finishing a basement/attic are the least common among consumer home improvement plans.\n\nLet us Know: Do home improvement shows on TV ever motivate you to do your own projects?\n\nEconomic pressures may be cooling the home improvement market, but not all consumers are abandoning their plans entirely. Instead, they appear to be they\u2019re focusing on projects that require less extensive work and financial strain. Taking on debt is also likely to play a key role in keeping home improvement plans afloat. To navigate these headwinds, retailers, and brands would be wise to focus on the most common project categories and emphasize DIY and financing options to capitalize on higher-intent consumers.\n\nWant to reach high-intent buyers in this tighter economic environment?

In a competitive market scenario where major stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, faced volatility amid tariff discussions and mixed economic data, Home Depot's share price experienced a 3% decline. The appointment of Michael Rowe as Executive Vice President of Pro and Stephanie Smith\u2019s promotion to EVP of Human Resources signal a focused investment in talent development and strategic customer engagement. Meanwhile, the broader market experienced an overall drop of 3%, largely driven by economic concerns and tariff impacts on global businesses. Despite the challenging external environment influencing investor sentiment, Home Depot\u2019s leadership adjustments signal an intention to further strengthen its operational foundation, though they did not prevent the downturn in share price over the observed period.\n\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of Home Depot.\n\nNYSE:HD Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe past five years have seen Home Depot achieve a total shareholder return of 90.76%, a notable performance that underscores its resilience and growth. Despite facing challenges in recent times, such as a slight decline in net income reported in its latest full-year earnings ending February 2025, the company's strategic initiatives have helped sustain its long-term growth. The launch of new partnerships with DoorDash and Uber Eats earlier this year, aimed at expanding same-day delivery services, illustrates Home Depot's adaptability in meeting consumer demands.\n\nFurthermore, ongoing financial maneuvers, including the completion of a significant share buyback program valued at US$3.6 billion in late 2024, have played an integral role in enhancing shareholder value. While Home Depot's one-year return has fallen short of the US Specialty Retail industry and broader market averages, its continued payment of a healthy dividend and strategic business expansions have provided a foundation for its solid five-year total return performance.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

Over the years, we have been investing across our stores to simplify and enhance the in-store shopping experience.\u201d\n\nThe Home Depot Inc. ranks No. 4 in the Top 2000 Database. The Digital Commerce 360 database ranks North America\u2019s largest online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Home Depot is also the top-ranked retailer in the Top 2000\u2019s Hardware & Home Improvement category.\n\nHow Home Depot increased its B2B sales\n\nHome Depot\u2019s B2B strategy includes:\n\nImproving freight flow processes\n\nLeveraging technology for increased on-shelf availability\n\nExpanding inventory with deeper assortments and job lot quantities\n\nRefining its labor model\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of customer experiences managers (CXMs) and enhanced selling tools with customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities have helped Home Depot better serve professional contractors.\n\n\u201cThese capabilities include a broader and deeper assortment of products in the fulfillment distribution center (FDC); dedicated sales teams that provide a higher level of service; enhanced selling tools with CRM capabilities to better serve our customers; additional digital capabilities through a B2B website, loyalty, and preferred pricing programs,\u201d Campbell added.\n\nThe company\u2019s targeted investments have not only driven growth with large contractors managing complex projects but have also yielded a meaningful increase in sales across all professional categories and purchase occasions. Despite these gains, Campbell acknowledged that there is still work to be done to improve the service, including enhancements in delivery experience, trade credit offerings, and order management.\n\n\u201cIn fact, these investments have driven over $1 billion in incremental sales on an annualized basis in 17 markets,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cEven in these 17 markets, we are in different stages of maturity, and there is still a lot to do to better serve all our Pros.\u201d\n\nHome Depot full-year sales in 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Home Depot\u2019s full-year 2024 sales grew by $6.8 billion. That reflects a 4.5% year-over-year increase to $159.5 billion. However, comparable sales for the year declined by 1.8% both in the U.S. and overall.\n\nIn March 2024, Home Depot announced the acquisition of SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion, a major move aimed at strengthening its distribution network and expanding its reach in the professional contractor market. The deal enhanced Home Depot\u2019s capabilities in serving roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors by leveraging SRS\u2019 established distribution channels.\n\nSRS Distribution is a specialty trade distribution company. It generated approximately $10 billion in revenue in 2023. Of that, it generated $1 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The acquisition brings a strong logistics infrastructure and a deep customer base, further solidifying Home Depot\u2019s ability to provide targeted services to professional customers.\n\nHome Depot CEO Ted Decker highlighted the strategic importance of the acquisition.\n\n\u201cSRS Distribution brings deep industry expertise and a robust network that aligns with our Pro-focused strategy,\u201d Decker said. \u201cThis acquisition accelerates our ability to deliver enhanced solutions and strengthens our relationships with professional customers.\u201d\n\nBy integrating SRS Distribution into its operations, Home Depot aims to:\n\nImprove product availability\n\nOptimize distribution efficiency\n\nIncrease engagement with professional contractors\n\nThe move cements Home Depot\u2019s commitment to growing its B2B sales segment.

            "content": "According to data from Abrdn, it was noted that between December 2002 and December 2022, companies that either increased or initiated dividends achieved a compounded return of 10.68%. In contrast, firms that reduced or discontinued their dividends saw a significantly lower return of 2.70%. In addition, it was highlighted that companies not paying dividends also lagged behind dividend growers, generating a return of 9.25% over the same timeframe.\n\nDividends are a key component of the investment market, with nearly 80% of companies in the broader market distributing payments to shareholders. However, maintaining steady dividend increases is a difficult achievement. Only about 13% of companies in the index qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes corporations that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks, as they have demonstrated strong long-term performance, especially during times of elevated interest rates.\n\nThe report mentioned that one possible scenario for 2025 is that earnings-per-share growth outpaces market gains, leading to a decline in overall price-to-earnings valuations. Factors such as prolonged high interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties could contribute to a lackluster year, causing some of the recent optimism to fade. However, if this happens, the market could regain momentum in 2026, making 2025 more of a temporary pause rather than a deeper downturn.\n\nAnalysts do not expect the market\u2019s strong run to persist this year. A report from Morgan Stanley points out that while the third year of a bull market tends to deliver only modest returns on average, it is usually not negative.\n\nStock market investors have enjoyed strong annual returns over the past two years, but analysts caution that 2025 may not deliver a repeat performance. In 2024, the broader market posted a 23% gain, following a 24% increase in 2023. When factoring in dividends, total returns for those years reached 25% and 26%, respectively. However, such sustained high returns are uncommon. According to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, US stocks have only recorded three consecutive years of 20%-plus total returns once since 1928, during the late 1990s.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen assessing the reliability of dividend stocks, analysts suggest that investors should emphasize dividend growth rather than being lured by high yields that may not be sustainable. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, underscored the significance of dividend growth as a strategy distinct from high-yield investing. He pointed out that companies with consistent dividend growth often have strong competitive advantages and promising future outlooks. A portfolio focused on dividend growth generally mirrors the broader market in terms of sector allocation and the balance between growth and value characteristics, including price-to-earnings ratios. While it leans toward a value-driven approach, it remains more balanced and core-oriented compared to portfolios concentrated on high-yield stocks.\n\nAlthough dividend stocks did not experience the same level of gains as tech stocks in 2024, they still delivered impressive returns. That year, companies across the broader market that distributed dividends returned approximately 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, according to Bloomberg. On average, these companies had a dividend yield of around 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield was about 1.5%. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the companies in the broader market and picked dividend stocks with dividend yields of about 2%, as of February 27. From that list, we picked 15 dividend stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds, as of Q4 20234. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based multinational home improvement company that offers related products and services to its consumers. The company delivered robust fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, reporting revenue of $39.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 14%. For fiscal 2025, it anticipates total sales growth of approximately 2.8%, with comparable sales projected to rise by about 1% over the same 52-week period. Additionally, the company aims to open roughly 13 new stores and expects a gross margin of around 33.4%.\n\nIn the past 12 months, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has surged by nearly 4%. With a presence in more than 2,300 locations across North America, the company\u2019s performance is closely tied to trends in the real estate market. Although it has maintained steady growth and strong profitability, it has encountered challenges due to elevated mortgage rates. Higher borrowing costs have contributed to a decline in home sales and a lower inventory of available properties, which in turn has affected consumer spending on home improvement projects.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) ended the quarter with over $1.65 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During fiscal 2024, it generated nearly $20 billion in operating cash flow, reinforcing its solid financial standing. This stability has allowed the company to sustain uninterrupted dividend payments for 152 consecutive quarters. In addition, it raised its quarterly dividend by 2.2% to $2.30 per share, marking the 15th straight year of dividend growth. With a dividend yield of 2.35%, as of February 27, HD is one of the best dividend stocks in the broader market.\n\nOverall HD ranks 5th on our list of the best S&P 500 dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Ethan Conrad is promising us the moon with his Home Depot and fast-food paradise, but let\u2019s be real here \u2013 haven\u2019t we seen this movie before?\n\nLook, I\u2019m all for bringing new business to town. But putting a Home Depot in Citrus Heights would directly compete with other established retailers such as Contractors Supply, Lowe\u2019s, Green Acres, and Batteries Plus all within 1.5 miles of the proposed development. Do we really need another big box store that will simply take business away from retailers that have been serving our community for years? Rather than creating new economic growth, this plan risks simply reshuffling the same customers and dollars.\n\nAnd those fast-food drive-thrus Conrad\u2019s so proud of? Drive by Chick-fil-A or In-N-Out during lunch hour. Those backed-up lanes aren\u2019t creating prosperity \u2013 they\u2019re creating headaches and fender-benders. Now imagine eight more drive-thrus crammed into the mall property. Do we really need them when Citrus Heights already has a total of 94 quick-service restaurants, with about half of those having drive-thrus? Great, more traffic and trash, just what we needed!\n\nWe\u2019re running out of buildable land in Citrus Heights \u2013 we\u2019re 98% built out. This plan tosses away a golden opportunity for mixed-use housing that could help us meet state requirements. Instead of forward-thinking development, we\u2019re getting\u2026 mini storage? Really? The old Sears building becoming a storage facility? That\u2019s like turning prime downtown real estate into a parking garage. It generates almost no tax revenue and brings zero life to the area.\n\nMake no mistake about what\u2019s happening here. Ethan Conrad wants to do what\u2019s best for his bottom line, and he\u2019s willing to have his team show up at community meetings painting doomsday scenarios for the mall if we don\u2019t accept his amendments. He positions himself as the only savior in the development world who would take on a project like Sunrise Mall.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, at this moment he only owns about 20% of the mall\u2014not the entire site. Ethan thinks we\u2019re desperate and that our community is foolish enough to sell our future for more lumber and chicken sandwiches. We deserve better than to be talked down to by a developer who owns just a fraction of the property but acts like he controls its destiny.\n\nThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine Sunrise Mall. Let\u2019s not waste it on yesterday\u2019s retail model that\u2019s already failing elsewhere in areas around. We can demand development that builds community and prosperity, not just another place to buy power tools and grab a burger. Citrus Heights deserves better, and it\u2019s up to us to speak up before it\u2019s too late.\n\nGigi Rayford is a longtime resident of Citrus Heights and Executive Director of Citrus Heights Arts.",

            "content": "February 28, 2025\n\nBoth Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s saw quarterly same-store sales return to growth after eight straight quarters of declines but offered soft guidance for the current year due to the fallout from ongoing high mortgage rates.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s same-store sales grew 0.8% in the fourth quarter. On an analyst call, the home improvement chain\u2019s CEO Ted Decker said results exceeded expectations \u201cas we saw greater engagement in home improvement spend, despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects.\u201d\n\nTen of Home Depot\u2019s 16 departments posted positive comps, but weakness was seen in purchases supporting larger discretionary projects, such as kitchen and bath remodels, where customers typically use financing. For the current year, Home Depot forecast same-store sales growth of only 1%, with management assuming no change in the mortgage environment nor improvements in housing turnover.\n\nA report last year from brokerage Redfin found only 25, or 2.5%, of every 1,000 U.S. single family homes and condos/townhouses changed hands in the first eight months of 2024, marking the lowest turnover rate in at least three decades.\n\nThe lean turnover rate was attributed to elevated mortgage rates, with more than three-quarters of mortgaged U.S. homeowners having secured a rate under 5%, below current rates between 6% and 7% in recent months. This creates a \u201clock-in effect,\u201d where many homeowners hold off on selling and buying another home using a higher rate and also defer major DIY projects with no near-term plans to sell. Other factors feeding lower housing turnover include record high prices for U.S. homes, significantly smaller housing supply versus pre-pandemic levels, and economic and political uncertainty.\n\nOn the call, Decker said Home Depot\u2019s customer remains \u201cvery healthy,\u201d with rising incomes, home equity values vaulting 50% since the end of 2019, and the benefit from appreciating stock market values. He suspects homeowners will eventually tap that expanding home equity to tackle larger remodeling projects once they realize rates are \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to return to lows seen in recent years. Decker added, \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure that turn comes in 2025 at a dramatically accelerated pace.\u201d\n\nFannie Mae predicts that the 30-year mortgage rate will remain at or above 6.5% for all of 2025.\n\nLowe\u2019s same-store sales inched up 0.2% in the fourth quarter, also above expectations, as mid-single digit growth with its Pro customers \u2014 or professionals such as contractors, landscapers, plumbers, and electricians \u2014 offset weakness in discretionary spending from its DIY homeowner customers, particularly around bigger ticket projects.\n\nFor the current year, Lowe\u2019s forecast same-stores sales to be flat to up 1%, with officials expecting the broader home improvement market to be flat, driven by repair and maintenance rather than upgrade projects.\n\nMarvin Ellison, president and CEO of the home improvement chain, noted on an analyst call that several factors, including home price appreciation, disposable personal income growing faster than inflation, and the oldest existing housing stock in U.S. history, will continue to lead homeowners to invest in home repairs and upgrades. He added, \u201cAnd we anticipate that some homeowners will begin to tap into record levels of equity in their homes to fund larger renovation projects.\u201d\n\nHowever, he pointed out that mortgage rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in more than two decades. This in turn is \u201ccreating a significant gap between today\u2019s rate for homebuyers and the lower rates many homeowners currently enjoy,\u201d leading to the lowest pace of existing home sales in the U.S. in nearly 30 years. He added, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s difficult to predict the timing of when we\u2019ll see lower rates and increased home improvement demand, we remain confident in the medium- to long-term outlook of our business.\u201d",

The new target represents a 13% premium to where the stock is trading as I write this and is a sign that the worst might be over for the housing-improvement market.\n\nA recovery in progress\n\nRecent results from Home Depot and rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) gave cause for optimism that growth is returning. Lowe's comparable sales increased by 0.2% in its fourth quarter, and management expects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% for the full year.\n\nTurning back to Home Depot, its comparable sales were up 0.8% in the fourth quarter, with comparable transactions up 0.6% and its comparable average ticket price up 0.2%. In concert with Lowe's, Home Depot's management expects 1% comparable sales growth in 2025.\n\nWhile these numbers sound anemic, the market is looking for a turning point that could lead to a sustained upturn. The Wells Fargo analyst acknowledges there are headwinds, and the exact time the recovery will kick in is unclear, but Home Depot is a fundamentally strong business. Moreover, the housing recovery will occur at some stage, even if it's largely due to easier comparisons with prior years.\n\nIs Home Depot a stock to buy?\n\nThe \"buying the housing recovery\" thesis makes sense, but it's hard to think that Home Depot -- a stock that trades at 26 times Wall Street's estimates for 2025 earnings -- is the best way to get exposure to it on a risk-reward basis.\n\nIt's a relatively low-risk way to play the idea and a relatively low-reward way. It may suit more conservative investors looking to play the theme. Still, plenty of other housing-related stocks (including many that distribute through Home Depot) are on much lower valuations with significantly more upside if you are bullish on housing. With the timing and strength of the housing recovery still an ongoing debate, it's hard to get too excited about Home Depot.",

            "content": "Home Depot (HD -4.19%) has been experiencing a multiyear slowdown. Its latest earnings report and commentary from the earnings call suggest that Home Depot will not see a recovery in the housing market or home improvement projects anytime soon.\n\nHere's why the retailer is a useful barometer for consumer spending and the housing market and why Home Depot, despite being in a cyclical slowdown, is still a dividend stock that is worth buying now.\n\nHome Depot's growth has ground to a halt\n\nWith a market cap of more than $390 billion, Home Depot is one of the most valuable retail companies in the world. However, unlike other massive retailers like Walmart or Costco Wholesale, Home Depot is unique because it caters to consumers, professional customers, and contractors. Given the relationship between home improvement spending and the housing market, Home Depot can also provide a valuable gauge of the health of consumer spending across discretionary categories.\n\nHome Depot has been slowing for a variety of reasons. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled forward sales as consumers ramped up spending on do-it-yourself projects. Then came supply chain issues, inflation, and rising interest rates.\n\nRelatively high mortgage interest rates have contributed to low existing home sales and relatively unaffordable housing -- which slowed Home Depot's performance.\n\nBut this quarter, Home Depot broke a two-year streak of declining same-store sales -- a positive sign that the worst of the slowdown may be over. The bad news is that Home Depot provided a bleak outlook for fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nA recovery is not around the corner\n\nHome Depot expects comparable sales growth of just 1% in fiscal 2025 and 2.8% total sales growth, driven partly by the opening of approximately 13 new stores. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to decline by 3%, with adjusted diluted EPS down 2%. Operating margins are expected to be 13%, with adjusted operating margins of 13.4%.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, this forecast would give Home Depot its lowest operating margin in more than eight years, while its revenue and earnings have been flatlining or slightly declining for more than two years.\n\nHD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nConsumer spending has so far held fast\n\nOn the earnings call, Home Depot management provided useful insights into the health of the consumer and the housing market.\n\nRichard McPhail, Home Depot CFO, said the following on the call:\n\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect the underlying momentum in the business that we saw in the back half of 2024 to continue into 2025. However, we are not assuming any meaningful changes to the macroeconomic environment. We expect our consumer will remain healthy. We are not assuming a change in the rate environment nor improvements in housing turnover. As a result, we would expect continued pressure on larger remodeling projects.\n\nTed Decker, Home Depot CEO, said the following in response to an analyst question on the housing market and mortgage rates:\n\nAt this point, while we've seen a little life in turnover in Q4, we're not expecting meaningful increase off that 40-year low. We've likely reached the bottom of housing turnover at about 3% of units, but we're not expecting a big rebound nor significant increases in new housing starts. However, if you just step back, I mean, if you look at our customer, they remain very healthy. So our customer is very healthy. We look at our customer today, we think about $110,000 average income. Those incomes have been growing. We've talked about the increase in home equity values, up 50% since the end of '19, and then wealth effect through the stock market and other investments. So our customer is very healthy. And as you say, if they're staying in their homes longer, they will take on larger remodeling projects as opposed to moving, those that are locked into lower interest rates or just not wanting to get mortgages with the higher rates. But we're not anticipating a large decrease in mortgage rates. It will be more an issue of consumers getting used to these higher rates.\n\nIn sum, consumers have been impressively resilient, even when facing higher interest rates. But the housing market has reached a noteworthy slowdown, which is having ripple effects to home improvement.\n\nThe wealth effect is also worth pointing out. As Home Depot's CEO said, home equity values are up. Because of that, along with a strong period in the stock market, investors are generally wealthier. The problem is that folks who haven't benefited from those trends are even more strained -- making goods, services, and especially big-ticket items like a home or renovation project more expensive.\n\nHome Depot is still worth buying and holding\n\nHome Depot's weak guidance and management's commentary on the earnings call may lead some investors to run for the exits on Home Depot stock. But glass-half-full investors will appreciate how honest management was on the call, choosing to tell the situation how it is rather than overpromising that a recovery is near.\n\nAs the undisputed industry leader in the U.S. home improvement industry (with stores across Canada, Mexico, and other countries as well), Home Depot is well positioned to endure the current slowdown. It sports 16 consecutive years of dividend raises, a 2.3% dividend yield, and a reasonable (but not cheap) valuation.\n\nAdd it all up, and Home Depot is still a solid long-term buy, even if the business doesn't return to growth for at least another year.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts on the US government and how action against smaller agencies such as USAID can translate into action against larger agencies and programs.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\"But I do think that when the Defense Department is on the [inaudible], and then Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, Medicare, Medicaid, I don't know a soul who thinks that there isn't fat in there. And I also think that, kind of like the labor department, with the unemployment number we really don't know what it is we have big revisions, if we had, if we gave to Salesforce, I don't know. . .I think that, if we gave these companies, literally outsourced these companies, I know people are going to say, Jim you are like, that is so right wing, but if there's, the machines are better. . \"\n\nCramer also commented on recent Bitcoin price action which saw the cryptocurrency dip below the $90,000 mark. He linked Bitcoin as being a \"proxy for the fact that we have thirty-six trillion in debt.\" Cramer also wondered how much of the gain in Bitcoin's price was due to Michael Saylor's firm adding the currency to its balance sheet.\n\nCramer added that his team has concluded that so much of the \"froth\" in the market in untested areas such as quantum computing came from Bitcoin. He outlined: \"The reason why we've had so much froth . . .we think that Bitcoin got people very excited about things that are space age and that the fundament of speculation is Bitcoin. That's what turned it all on.\"\n\nAnother topic that caught the CNBC TV host's attention was the mergers and acquisition environment in the Trump administration. After the President's election victory in November, investors were ecstatic as they believed that the new administration could create a healthy environment for deals. Commenting on how the rules of the market still remained the same, Cramer outlined:",

            "content": "The Home Depot, Inc. ( ) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 27th of March to $2.30. This makes the dividend yield 2.3%, which is above the industry average.\n\nHome Depot's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Home Depot was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 18.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 59%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nHome Depot Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.88 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $9.20. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 17% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Home Depot has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 7.7% per annum. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.\n\nWe Really Like Home Depot's Dividend\n\nOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Home Depot is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

            "content": "Home Depot (HD -4.19%) is one of the best-performing stocks of all time. Since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1981, its stock has grown from a small home improvement chain to one of the most valuable retailers in the world, pioneering a new retail model -- a big-box home improvement store.\n\nHome Depot has thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs) in its stores, making it difficult for smaller traditional hardware stores to compete, and its economies of scale help keep prices low. The company has also invested in technology to support convenient options, like e-commerce and in-store pickup, differentiating itself that way as well.\n\nWith the slowdown in the housing market, Home Depot has struggled over the last few years, but it had good news to report on Tuesday. This sent the stock higher on a day when the market was down broadly on a weak consumer-confidence report.\n\nHome Depot returned to comparable sales growth, a key inflection point, as overall comps rose 0.8% in the quarter and U.S. comps were up 1.3%. Overall revenue was up 14.1% to $39.7 billion, benefiting from an extra week in the quarter and the acquisition early last year of SRS Distribution, the building materials supply company. That revenue figure beat estimates of $39.07 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share rose from $2.86 to $3.13, ahead of the consensus of $3.04. Without the benefit of the extra week, earnings per share (EPS) would have been $2.83.\n\nWhat to expect in 2025\n\nHome Depot sees macroeconomic conditions holding steady, though the reversal to positive comparable-sales growth is a sign that the worst of the headwinds from the housing slowdown are behind it now. The company is still seeing sluggish demand for larger projects but noted a modest increase in cash-out refinances and draws on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), a good sign for increased spending on home improvement. Americans are sitting on record levels of home equity and likely to tap that eventually, though it may require interest rates to come down.\n\nThe company's guidance called for comparable-sales growth of 1% and total sales growth of 2.8%, reflecting some benefit from SRS Distribution. It also sees adjusted earnings per share falling 2% to $15.24, which reflects investments in the business. It also shows the impact of SRS Distribution, which is a lower-margin business, on the company's overall profitability.\n\nSRS continues to look like a winner\n\nNearly a year ago, Home Depot made a bold move in acquiring SRS Distribution, a leading distributor of building supplies, for $18.25 billion. The acquisition expanded Home Depot's addressable market, gave it nearly 1,000 building-supply outlets around the country, and strengthened its relationship with the pro customer, which has been a traditional advantage over chief rival Lowe's. The SRS acquisition also gives Home Depot cross-sell opportunities, and it's already rolled out QuoteCenter, a real-time price-quoting platform, on SRS in a number of new markets, driving sales growth.\n\nIn 2025, Home Depot expects SRS Distribution to outperform the core business, with mid-single-digit organic sales growth. SRS Distribution, which has continued to operate under the same management team, is also making acquisitions of its own, completing four tuck-in acquisitions since Home Depot acquired it.\n\nIs Home Depot a buy?\n\nAs the company's guidance indicates, investors shouldn't expect any fireworks from Home Depot this year. The macro environment remains challenging, and the business is mature. The company just issued a 2.2% dividend hike, a modest increase reflecting the company's conservative forecast for earnings growth.\n\nWhile 2025 might not be a big year for Home Depot, long-term tailwinds look more promising, as the housing shortage in the U.S. should eventually start to close with new home construction. Interest rates are expected to come down at some point in the future, as well, though that may not happen this year. Meanwhile, the company remains highly profitable and should return to buying back stock once it's finished paying off the debt from its acquisition of SRS.\n\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27, the stock isn't cheap, but that also seems like a reasonable price to pay for a category leader like Home Depot. For long-term investors, Home Depot stock still looks like a buy.",

            "content": "The Home Depot Inc. grew its total sales at a faster rate than its online sales in its fiscal Q4, which ended Feb. 2, 2024.\n\nTotal Home Depot sales grew $4.9 billion, or 14.1%, in Q4 2024, reaching $39.7 billion. However, comparable sales were close to flat, at 0.8% growth overall and 1.3% growth in the United States.\n\nThat discrepancy comes, in part, from Home Depot\u2019s acquisition of SRS Distribution, which it completed in June 2024 for about $18.25 billion. In 2023, SRS Distribution had recorded about $10 billion in revenue, and $1 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nHome Depot\u2019s Q4 2024 also consisted of 14 weeks, compared to 13 the year prior. The extra week added about $2.5 billion in sales for Q4 and 2024 overall, Home Depot said.\n\nMeanwhile, full-year 2024 Home Depot Sales grew $6.8 billion. That\u2019s 4.5% growth year over year to $159.5 billion. And Home Depot comparable sales in 2024 declined 1.8% from 2023. The retailer\u2019s U.S. comparable sales decline was the same at 1.8%.\n\nIn Q4, Home Depot\u2019s comparable transactions increased 0.6%. Its comparable average order value (AOV) increased 0.2%. Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising, said on an earnings call with investors that inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted Home Depot\u2019s average order value.\n\nPresident and CEO Ted Decker said he thinks Home Depot has \u201cthe best team to manage through any tariff environment which would impact the industry broadly.\u201d He cited the retailer\u2019s diversification efforts regarding its supply chains.\n\n2025 State of American Ecommerce Report This report covers how the leading U.S.-based online retailers and their respective categories currently perform in ecommerce and provides projections through 202 6 . View Details\n\nHome Depot online sales in Q4\n\nExcluding the impact of an extra week in Q4 2024, Home Depot online sales grew 9% year over year in the quarter.\n\nThe Home Depot Inc. ranks No. 4 in the Top 2000 Database. The Digital Commerce 360 database ranks North America\u2019s largest online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Home Depot is also the top-ranked retailer in the Top 2000\u2019s Hardware & Home Improvement category.\n\nBastek attributed the growth in Home Depot online sales to focuses on:\n\nContinuous improvements to the shopping and browsing experience\n\nEnhancing the delivery and post-delivery experience\n\nLeveraging AI to enhance chat features and product descriptions\n\nCreating rating summaries for customers\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell, senior executive vice president, said on the earnings call that nearly all Home Depot Pros shop its stores. The retailer\u2019s in-store improvements have also led to improvements for online order fulfillment and delivery.\n\nImpact of delivery speed and fulfillment on Home Depot sales\n\n\u201cOur delivery speeds are now the fastest they\u2019ve ever been and customers are increasing their spend,\u201d Decker said.\n\nBastek added onto Decker\u2019s point, saying that Home Depot customers now have more fulfillment options than ever before, including same- and next-day delivery. Delivery speed is part of creating a strong customer experience, which drives higher engagement and conversion, he said.\n\nPart of that comes from investments in Home Depot\u2019s flatbed distribution centers (FDCs).\n\n\u201cOur investments in the FDC network have improved the in store experience by taking many deliveries out of the store, which reduces clutter in the aisles from staged orders,\u201d Campbell told investors. \u201cAs a result, our in-stock have improved and our associate availability is higher. The FDC has also enabled faster delivery, expanded fulfillment options and more consistent on-time and complete delivery of larger orders directly to the job site.\u201d\n\nHow many stores does Home Depot have?\n\nHome Depot opened 12 new stores in its fiscal 2024. Of those, 10 were in the U.S. and two were in Mexico.\n\nAs of the end of its fiscal 2024, Home Depot has 2,347 stores.\n\nHome Depot plans to open another 13 during its fiscal 2025, Decker told investors.\n\nPercentage changes may not align exactly with dollar figures due to rounding.

            "content": "Analysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 24.88\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail corporation that offers related products and services to its consumers. The company operates in over 2,300 locations across North America and is influenced by shifts in the real estate market. While the company is known for its consistent growth and strong profitability, it has faced challenges due to high mortgage rates. These higher borrowing costs have led to a slowdown in home sales and a reduced number of properties on the market, ultimately impacting consumer spending on home improvement projects. The stock has surged modestly by just 0.52% since the start of 2025.\n\nThat said, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently reported strong fourth-quarter earnings for 2024, with revenue reaching $39.7 billion\u2014an increase of more than 14% compared to the previous year. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, it expects total sales growth of approximately 2.8%, with comparable sales expected to rise by about 1% over the equivalent 52-week period. In addition, the company plans to open around 13 new locations and forecasts a gross margin of approximately 33.4%.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) closed the quarter with more than $1.65 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Throughout fiscal 2024, the company generated nearly $20 billion in operating cash flow. This strong financial position has enabled it to maintain uninterrupted dividend payments for 152 consecutive quarters. Additionally, the company announced a 2.2% increase in its quarterly dividend to $2.30 per share, marking its 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of February 26, the stock carries a dividend yield of 2.36%.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 10th on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company also says a majority of the products sold will be made in Mexico with plans to sell 100 percent national products.\n\nOn Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo and Home Depot Mexico President Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Garza, announced the company\u2019s investment plans.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum highlighted that The Home Depot investment is part of Plan Mexico, which aims to generate comprehensive regional development based on well-paid jobs that allow Mexicans to have access to basic rights such as housing, health and education.\n\n\u201cThe Home Depot is an example of a company that is already in Mexico and that is planning to expand its investment. Now one would think: \u2018Let\u2019s see, what is sold at Home Depot, where does it come from? Well, maybe it comes from Asia, it comes from other countries.\u2019 No, 80 percent is produced in Mexico,\u201d Sheinbaum said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf we manage to increase that percentage then not only are there jobs created, products sold, and the characteristics of this company that help Mexicans, but also more indirect jobs are created because what is purchased or the products that enter Home Depot for sale are also produced in our country,\u201d she said.\n\nXimena Escobedo Ju\u00e1rez, head of the Productive Development Unit and Office Chief of the Ministry of Economy said The Home Depot\u2019s investment contributes to Plan Mexico and that the goal is to sell 100 percent of its products coming from the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we are looking for with this new investment is that by 2028, we will have 100 percent of the national supply in all Home Depot,\u201d Escobedo Ju\u00e1rez said.\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Garza says that with the $1.3 billion USD investment, five stores will be opened per year to reach 165, which will exceed 20,000 direct jobs in the country.\n\n\u201cWe currently generate more than 18,000 direct jobs in Mexico. With this investment we will surpass 20,000 direct jobs and we estimate that for each job we generate in our division in Mexico, four additional jobs are generated in the Mexican economy. This is of great benefit to improve the quality of life of thousands of families in Mexico,\u201d he said.\n\nHe highlighted that The Home Depot Mexico has nearly 50,000 items of which 85 percent are from local suppliers. He said with this investment, they hope to have more products made in Mexico integrated into their stores in Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that what is made in Mexico is innovative, of quality and of value to millions of families in Mexico and abroad. That is why with this investment we will identify, develop and integrate even more local suppliers into our value chain, not only to seek supply in our operation in Mexico, but also to provide access to our stores in the United States and Canada, encouraging investment in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pointed out that The Home Depot Mexico is a company committed to sustainability and sustainability which is why half of its stores operate with renewable energy.\n\n\u201cAt The Home Depot we believe in and are committed to Mexico, to its people, to its enormous potential. That is why we will work hard to contribute to the sustainable development of the country, generate more jobs, strengthen local supply, contribute to growth and promote housing.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to continue building together a stronger, more prosperous and sustainable Mexico.

On a positive note, inflation cooled, but President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose large import taxes on Canada, Mexico, and China \u2014 the United States\u2019 top trading partners \u2014 will likely push prices higher, economists say. Some companies are already planning to raise prices in response.\n\nAmericans cut their spending by 0.2 percent in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday, likely in part because of unseasonably cold weather. Yet the retreat may be hinting at more caution by consumers amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump administration to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada beginning March 4, will also double 10 percent tariffs on China\n\n\u201cThe roller coaster of news headlines emanating from Washington D.C. is likely going to push businesses to the sidelines for a time and even appear to be impacting consumers,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, in an email.\n\nInflation declined to 2.5 percent in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.6 percent in December, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices dropped to 2.6 percent, the lowest since June, from 2.9 percent.\n\nEconomists noted that inflation would likely keep cooling, but the progress could be upended by tariffs. Trump said Thursday he would impose 25 percent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico, though just 10 percent on oil from Canada. He also said he wanted to double the current tariff on imports from China to 20 percent.\n\nTrump is also calling for widespread layoffs of federal workers, which could cause hundreds of thousands of job losses and potentially lift the unemployment rate.\n\nRandy Carr, CEO of World Emblem, says the tariffs, if imposed, will force him to raise prices and cut jobs. World Emblem makes patches, labels and badges for companies, universities and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe firm has factories in Georgia and California but it makes about 60 percent of its products in Mexico. Carr said if the 25 percent import taxes are imposed, he expects to raise prices by 5 percent to 10 percent. He also plans to cut \u201ca handful\u201d of jobs among the 500 workers his company has in the United States to help absorb the rest of the costs.\n\nCarr said he would also cancel about $9 million in planned investments in artificial intelligence and online commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so annoying,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now you have this volatility, and so you really can\u2019t plan anything. You just got to wait until we get a final verdict from from the administration. It\u2019s definitely not punishing Mexico, it\u2019s punishing us.\u201d\n\nThe inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said in January they planned to keep their key short-term interest rate on hold, at 4.3 percent, to slow borrowing and spending enough to lower inflation back to their 2 percent target. The Fed\u2019s elevated rate has contributed to higher borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.\n\nThe Fed prefers Friday\u2019s inflation measure to the more widely-known consumer price index, which rose for the fourth straight month in January to 3 percent. Friday\u2019s gauge calculates inflation slightly differently: For example, it puts less weight on the costs of housing and used cars.\n\nInflation spiked in 2022 to its highest level in four decades, propelling President Donald Trump to the White House and leading the Fed to rapidly raise interest rates to tame prices. It has since fallen from a peak of 7.2 percent, and some economists expect it could fall closer to 2 percent in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe inflation data could be distorted higher at exactly the time when the Fed would otherwise be in a position to declare a win,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nOne other bright spot in the report was that incomes jumped 0.9 percent in January from December, fueled in part by a large annual cost of living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries.\n\nYet Americans spent less anyway, in particular on cars, where purchases fell sharply. The cutbacks may also reflect a need for many consumers to save after spending a bit during the winter holiday season. Credit card debt surged in December, economists noted.\n\nA big concern right now is whether tariffs will push up inflation, or slow the economy, or \u2014 in a particularly toxic combination \u2014 both.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Boston branch this month concluded that 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with Trump\u2019s initial 10 import taxes on China, could lift core inflation by as much as 0.8 percentage points.\n\nMany toy companies had expressed relief when Trump has announced a 10 percent increase in tariffs on products from China because they thought they could share the extra costs between themselves and the retailer. But with a 20 percent tariff, they say they have no choice but to raise prices for shoppers. Around 80 percent of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to industry reports.\n\nCurtis McGill, CFO of small toy maker Hey Buddy Hey Pal, called the move \u201ca nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nMcGill had just confirmed a price for a toy with one major retailer Wednesday, but then had to withdraw the price after he heard about the tariffs. For the year-end holiday season, his toys will see a 10 percent price increase.\n\nWorries about tariffs pushing prices higher have sent consumer confidence plunging, unwinding the modest gains that had occurred after the election. Americans are also expecting inflation to move higher in the coming months. That\u2019s a risky trend because if consumers and businesses expect higher prices, they may act in ways to lift inflation, such as accelerating their purchases and boosting demand.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3 percent in January from the previous month, matching December\u2019s 0.3 percent increase. Core prices rose 0.3 percent, up from 0.2 percent in December. If sustained, January\u2019s increases would keep inflation running above the Fed\u2019s target. The Fed pays more attention to core prices because they provide a better read on future inflation.\n\nD\u2019Innocenzio reported from New York.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nAs Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot focus on growing the ranks of professional customers as a strategy to boost the bottom line, both retailers ended Q4 on a mostly positive note, a sign the home improvement sector may be rebounding.\n\nThe Home Depot on Tuesday posted positive quarterly comparable sales for the first time in two years. Comps for the holiday quarter were up 0.8% overall and 1.3% in the U.S. The comp growth marked \"a very clear win for Home Depot, and it suggests that the home improvement market as a whole might finally be reaching the nadir of its more sluggish performance,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments.\n\nThe retailer reported net sales during the 14 weeks of its fourth quarter hit $39.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to the year-ago period when there were 13 weeks in the quarter. Profits grew during the period, with operating income growing 8.5% year over year to $4.5 billion and net income increasing 7% to about $3 billion.\n\nFor the full year, net sales rose 4.5% to $159.5 billion from the prior year, although comparable sales declined 1.8% both overall and in the U.S. Operating income was nearly flat at $21.5 billion, while net income fell 2.2% to $14.8 billion.\n\nHome Depot CEO Ted Decker said its purchase of SRS \u2014 which it acquired in June \u2014 has contributed $6.4 billion in sales since then.\n\nThe retailer is also gaining ground with its pro customers. All pro cohorts saw positive comps during the fourth quarter, according to Ann-Marie Campbell, Home Depot\u2019s senior executive vice president of U.S. stores and operations.\n\nFollowing shortly after, rival home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter net sales were nearly flat year over year at $18.6 billion. Comp sales inched up 0.2%, driven by high-single-digit pro and online comps, holiday performance and hurricane rebuilding efforts, offset by ongoing pressure in discretionary spending by DIYers.\n\n\u201cEven though short-term interest rates have started to come down, this remains a challenging home improvement market,\u201d Lowe\u2019s CEO Marvin Ellison said during a Wednesday earnings call. \u201cMortgage rates are higher than they've been in more than two decades, creating a significant gap between today's rates for home buyers and the lower rates many homeowners currently enjoy.\u201d\n\nOperating income in Q4 grew 8.5% year over year to $1.8 billion, while net income during the period increased 10.3% to $1.1 billion.\n\nFor the full year, Lowe\u2019s reported net sales of $83.7 billion, a 3% decline from the prior year. Operating income fell 9.4% to $10.5 billion and net income declined about 10% to $7 billion.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges, Ellison was bullish on the long-term outlook for the business, pointing to home price appreciation, disposable personal income growth rising faster than inflation and the oldest existing housing stock in U.S. history. Together, Ellison forecast those factors would sustain long-term demand as homeowners tap into equity to invest in major repair and upgrade projects.\n\nBoth Lowe's and Home Depot \"have solid strategies to drive their businesses,\" Telsey Advisory Group analysts, led by Joe Feldman, said in a Wednesday note. \u201cLowe's should remain a long-term share gainer and benefit from its Total Home strategy \u2014 strengthening merchandising and space productivity, leveraging technology, broadening the omnichannel model, and expanding the pro business.\u201d\n\nLast week, Lowe\u2019s updated its professional contractor loyalty program. The changes refocus the program toward small- and mid-sized contractors to make it easier to earn and redeem rewards.\n\nLowe's Executive Vice President of Stores Joe MacFarland said both its pro and DIY customer loyalty programs run on the same tech platform, which he said should increase customer engagement and drive repeat purchases.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts describe both Home Depot\u2019s and Lowe\u2019s outlooks as cautious. Home Depot projects total sales to grow about 2.8% year over year and comps to grow 1%. It expects to open 13 new stores during the year. Meanwhile, Lowe\u2019s forecasts total sales to be between $83.5 billion and $84.5 billion, about flat to up 1%, with comps also flat to up 1%.\n\n\u201cThe home improvement market might have reached the bottom of its long period of decline, but we do not believe the recovery will be a straight upward line,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThere are too many pressures on the market, including elevated interest rates and potentially higher prices from tariffs, to guarantee such stability.\u201d",

            "content": "Over the last four weeks, we've observed a general rotation from traditionally offensive sectors like technology and consumer discretionary to more defensive sectors including real estate and consumer staples. One of the top weights in the consumer discretionary sector, Home Depot , may soon confirm a bearish price pattern that implies much further potential downside for this home improvement retailer. One of my favorite ways to measure \"offense vs. defense\" is to chart the ratio of consumer discretionary to consumer staples. Basically, we are comparing \"things you want\" to \"things you need,\" with the idea that when people are optimistic about the economy and have money available, they will spend on discretionary purchases like travel and luxury goods. This ratio has been favoring offense since August 2024, providing a clear sign of optimism for the US economic growth. But since a peak in mid-January, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund has underperformed the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) . This rotation was mainly driven by a breakdown in two of the leading weights in the XLY, namely Amazon.com and Tesla , while many stocks in the consumer staples sector experienced a strong upside reversal. I'm also showing an equal-weighted version of this ratio in the bottom panel, which actually continued higher into early February. But after the consumer staples sector began to improve earlier this month, the equal-weighted ratio also has now clearly turned lower. This confirms a clear rotation into the consumer staples sectors as investors have rotated to more defensive positions. Home Depot, currently the third largest weight in the XLY behind AMZN and TSLA, is now featuring a potential head and shoulders topping pattern. When HD achieved a new high in November, this move came on weaker RSI readings, creating a bearish momentum divergence. The lower price high in January suggested a lack of willing buyers to push Home Depot to yet another new all-time high. With a head and shoulders pattern, the most important level is the \"neck line\" formed by connecting the swing lows between the head and the two shoulders. If HD is unable to hold this key support level, then the pattern would suggest significant further downside. It's also worth noting that the neckline lines up almost perfectly with the 200-day moving average, providing even more significance to support around $380. The weekly chart of Home Depot provides a longer-term perspective to the recent pullback, featuring a weekly PPO sell signal in December 2024. This bearish indication has often provided an effective warning sign that the previous bullish phase was most likely ended. The most recent sell signal, in early April 2024, saw HD drop down to an ascending 40-week moving average before the uptrend resumed. That means that we have already experienced a similar pullback in 2025, with Home Depot currently testing support at this key long-term barometer. One thing I've learned through previous bear market cycles is that the initial selloff often looks like a very buyable pullback. What separates the brief pullbacks from the more significant drawdowns usually comes down to whether prices are able to hold important support levels after the initial drop. For Home Depot, a push below the crucial $380 level could mean much further deterioration in store for this big box retailer. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: None.

Wilson is 100 years old. She believes maintaining a busy schedule \u2014 which includes working at Home Depot two to three mornings per week \u2014 is a big contributor to her longevity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me sharp,\u201d Wilson said from her home in Louisville, where she lives on her own.\n\nA growing body of scientific research supports Wilson\u2019s idea about aging well: Staying active with work, hobbies, socializing or volunteering can be a key factor in longevity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence showing that keeping busy is good for older adults,\u201d said Deborah Carr, director of the Center for Innovation in Social Science and a professor of sociology at Boston University. \u201cIt helps your mental health, your physical health. It really does have a lot of positive effects.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome studies suggest extending working life \u2014 especially in a job or occupation that gives a person meaning \u2014 may contribute to greater longevity. Volunteering, too, may lead to slowed biological aging, according to a recent study, and socializing regularly has been linked to a significantly lower risk of premature death.\n\nAll these activities lead to a heightened sense of purpose, and research has shown that having a strong sense of purpose can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.\n\nWilson started working at Home Depot in July 2021. As a self-proclaimed \u201cmorning person,\u201d her shifts are from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. She is the company\u2019s oldest employee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson said she does the job not for the paycheck, but for her health \u2014 both mental and physical.\n\n\u201cI do it to get up and start moving, and feel important,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson works the cash register, and she doesn\u2019t sit down for the full four hours of her shift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on my feet the entire time,\u201d she said, explaining that this helps to keep her physically fit.\n\nJust as important is the human connection she gets at the store. Talking with customers supports her cognitive function, she said, and also helps to fulfill her emotionally.\n\n\u201cTo make people smile and be a light in their day \u2014 that\u2019s very important to me,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI feel terrific.\u201d\n\nIn her spare time, Wilson dances. (She was a professional dancer in her youth and continued performing up until a few years ago.) She also taught herself piano and enjoys painting and cooking. She writes a daily to-do list while drinking her morning coffee.\n\nKeeping busy and interacting with people offers protective benefits particularly for older adults who live alone \u2014 as more people tend to look out for them and notice if they\u2019re missing or unwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt means more eyes and ears,\u201d Carr said, adding that being busy can stave off loneliness \u2014 a condition that puts people at a greater risk of depression, anxiety, dementia and even heart disease.\n\nShe said people should only engage in the activities they have the cognitive and physical capacity to do.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that people find something to keep busy with that allows them to shine,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost always an adaptation that they can do, where they take it down a little bit.\u201d\n\nFor example, if someone can\u2019t get on the floor for yoga, that person could try chair yoga.\n\nAcross the country, many older adults are thriving by staying active. There\u2019s Virginia Oliver \u2014 otherwise known as the \u201cLobster Lady\u201d \u2014 who, at 104, is still hauling lobster traps in Maine. Hilda Jaffe, 102, walks 3,000 steps a day, belongs to a book club and volunteers at the New York Public Library. Doug Turner, 87, throws an annual winter party for his neighborhood in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and delivers handwritten invites door-to-door.\n\nDeborah Szekely, 102, is a wellness guru, and she still works two days a week at Rancho La Puerta, the fitness and spa retreat she founded in 1940 in Mexico. She hosts regular dinners and lunches, and she holds a weekly Q&A session for around 100 to 150 guests at the resort. She is also working on a memoir.\n\n\u201cTo have longevity, you must have purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cStaying busy gives you purpose.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor older adults looking to get busy but don\u2019t know where to start, Szekely has some advice. For one, \u201cset a routine,\u201d she said, and follow it every day.\n\n\u201cMake a list of key friends, invite them to lunch, and find out your common interests and what they do to keep busy,\u201d Szekely said.\n\nIf someone is more of a homebody and prefers to spend time in solitude, they can take up a new hobby.\n\n\u201cI read, read, read,\u201d said Szekely, who finishes a book a week.\n\nBill Youman, 83, credits his volunteer work with keeping him healthy. He\u2019s not a centenarian but said he hopes to continue volunteering if he\u2019s lucky enough to reach 100, and he\u2019s laying the groundwork now.\n\n\u201cEverybody feels better when they help other people,\u201d said Youman, who volunteers five days a week with Meals on Wheels in Terre Haute, Indiana, and is also a bell ringer for the Salvation Army during the Christmas season. \u201cI have good health for many reasons, but that certainly is a factor. \u2026 I\u2019m the one that benefits when I do this.\u201d\n\nMonday through Friday, Youman \u2014 a retired high school teacher \u2014 spends his mornings delivering meals to people in need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery place I go, when they come to the door, there are smiles,\u201d Youman said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding for me. \u2026 You meet a lot of good people.\u201d\n\nKarl Pillemer, a professor of human development at Cornell University, said engaging in volunteer work \u201creduces mortality risk by surprisingly high amounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to provide unique benefits to people\u2019s well-being,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cpeople who are doing volunteer work are more likely to meet physical activity guidelines.\u201d\n\nBut being an active participant in society, Pillemer said, isn\u2019t always simple for older adults. Age discrimination can make it difficult to get (or keep) a job, join a social group or even make new friends. Other factors can get in the way, too.\n\n\u201cThere is vast inequality on the basis of economic resources and race and ethnicity,\u201d Carr said. \u201cOlder people can stay engaged, but they have to be allowed in.\u201d\n\nWilson recognizes that not everyone can \u2014 or wants to \u2014 work at 100, but she believes all people can find a way to connect with others as they age.",

The firm believes there were promising signs of stabilization after two years of eroding metrics.\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Intuit (INTU) to Overweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $730, following the fiscal Q2 report. The firm says building momentum in small business, solid yields on the company's efficiency initiatives and a \"conservative\" second half of 2025 outlook sets up Intuit for positive estimate revisions near term.\n\nErste Group upgraded Coca-Cola (KO) to Buy from Hold. Profitability is higher than that of its competitors, both in terms of operating margin and return on equity, notes the firm, which adds that revenue growth this year will also be supported by new products like probiotic lemonades.\n\nRedburn Atlantic upgraded American Airlines (AAL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $24, up from $18. While network airlines have performed well over the past 12 months, positive catalysts from both earnings and free cash flow upgrades through this year creates an attractive entry point at current share levels, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nHSBC upgraded Home Depot (HD) to Hold from Reduce with a price target of $410, up from $356, post the Q4 report. The firm cites the company's positive same-store sales inflection point, despite pressure on large remodeling projects, for the upgrade.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\n\n\nErste Group downgraded Lululemon (LULU) to Hold from Buy. The firm says the \"deteriorating\" consumer confidence in the U.S., which fell to its lowest level in the last 14 months in February, is a \"burden\" on Lululemon's further sales and earnings growth.\n\nErste Group downgraded UnitedHealth (UNH) to Hold from Buy. A recent civil investigation by the Department of Justice into the accuracy of patient billings covered by the Medicare Advantage Plan increases economic uncertainty for investors, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBofA downgraded Lucid Group (LCID) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $1, down from $3. The departure of founder, CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson is \"much more consequential than understood by the market,\" argues the firm, which now expects product development to stall and consumer demand to be dampened.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Krispy Kreme (DNUT) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $6, down from $12. While the company's Q4 miss \"was understood,\" its \"materially worse\" 2025 guidance, and some of the associated commentary, \"undercuts the idea that ample demand\" for the brand will drive an extended period of U.S. growth, the firm tells investors in a research note.",

Fourth-quarter revenue of $39.7 billion jumped 14.1% from the previous year's quarter, outperforming expectations of $39.2 billion. This increase was supported by an extra operating week in Q4, contributing approximately $2.5 billion to sales. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) hit $3.13, topping the expected $3.04.\n\nDespite these positive results, challenges remain, such as broader market pressures impacting its comparable sales, which grew by a modest 1.3% in the U.S. and 0.8% overall.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) Adjusted EPS $3.13 $3.04 $2.86 9.4% Revenue $39.7 billion $39.2 billion $34.8 billion 14.1% Net earnings $3.0 billion N/A $2.8 billion 7% Comparable sales overall 0.8% (2%) (3.5%) N/A Comparable sales U.S. 1.3% N/A (4%) N/A Customer transactions 400 million N/A 372 million 7.6%\n\nAbout Home Depot\n\nHome Depot is a major player in the home improvement sector, providing a diverse range of products and services to both DIY customers and professional contractors. It has made strategic investments in digital technologies to integrate its physical and online sales platforms, creating a seamless shopping experience. This omnichannel approach lets customers order online and pick up in-store or curbside. Home Depot's business strategy centers around improving its supply chain capabilities, strengthening its professional customer segment, and enhancing sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) responsibilities.\n\nThe company's recent focus areas, including improving the interconnected shopping experience and engaging professional customers, underscore its strategic priorities. Key factors for success include supply chain optimization, capturing more professional customer revenue, and bolstering its sustainability efforts. These strategic initiatives help Home Depot maintain competitive service levels and respond to evolving consumer preferences in a rapidly changing retail landscape.\n\nQuarter in Review\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Home Depot demonstrated strong financial results despite the broader macroeconomic challenges it faced. Net earnings rose to $3 billion from $2.8 billion, reinforcing the company's ability to manage costs efficiently amid tough market conditions.\n\nU.S. comparable sales increased by 1.3%, while overall comparable sales rose by 0.8%. This reflects moderate organic growth when excluding the impact of the extra week. Customer transactions reached 400.4 million, up 7.6% from last year, partly due to enhanced in-store services and omnichannel investments.\n\nHome Depot continued to leverage its Pro Xtra loyalty program and expanded supply chain capacities to enhance professional customer engagement. The Pro segment remains a focal point, contributing significantly to the company's revenue streams. Investments in supply chain automation and expanded fulfillment centers are crucial for sustaining competitive service levels, particularly important in the face of growing e-commerce rivalry from companies like Amazon (AMZN -2.51%).\n\nAdditionally, Home Depot increased its dividend by 2.2%, highlighting strong cash flow generation and dedication to returning value to shareholders. This marks a continued commitment to its capital allocation strategy, balancing reinvestment in growth and shareholder returns.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nLooking forward, Home Depot has given a somewhat cautious outlook for fiscal 2025. It anticipates sales growth of around 2.8% with a 1% increase in comparable sales. Management expects diluted earnings per share to decline by approximately 3% due to persistent macroeconomic pressures. It projects a 2% decline in 2025's adjusted EPS to $15.24.\n\nIn light of these projections, Home Depot is committed to ongoing investments in its digital presence and physical store experience, particularly bolstering its supply chain and Pro customer offerings. Investors should keep an eye on the company's ability to adapt to market conditions, emphasizing its commitment to sustainability and efficiency as crucial determinants of future performance. Additionally, monitoring competitive dynamics in the retail sector will be essential for gauging Home Depot's progress and strategic adjustments in a fast-evolving marketplace.",

Each of the bags weighs 60 pounds and appears to have some level of damage.\n\n\"There's got to be a better way to get rid of concrete,\" the original poster wrote.\n\nAnother Home Depot employee said their store sells damaged concrete at 50% off, but the OP responded that their location needed the bags gone ASAP \u2014 presumably for aesthetic purposes \u2014 because corporate would be doing a walk-through.\n\nOther Redditors suggested the store should have at least tried to give it away.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nShoving damaged concrete into the compactor might seem like a quick and easy solution, but this practice could cost Home Depot significant money in the long term.\n\n\"I had to chisel out dried concrete from a compactor for 4 hours and I had to rebuild the hydraulic pump,\" the OP said, adding, \"It's gonna destroy the compactor.\"\n\n\"Huge problem,\" another affirmed.\n\nBeyond the business impact, the concrete took a lot of energy to make, raising the question of whether something could've been done to prevent that investment from being lost.\n\nAs a study in PNAS explains, the production of cement (the primary ingredient in concrete) is \"the largest single industrial emitter\" of carbon dioxide.\n\nThis heat-trapping gas significantly contributes to warming global temperatures \u2014 the effects of which include food insecurity and an increased risk of disease.\n\nIs Home Depot doing anything about this?\n\nOn its website, Home Depot details how it is working toward a more sustainable future, highlighting initiatives aimed at reducing plastic waste and water use, adopting renewable energy, and eliminating toxic chemicals from its products.\n\nHome Depot has also partnered with EnergyStar, an energy-efficiency program from the Environmental Protection Agency. According to its 2024 Environmental, Social and Governance, these efforts have connected customers with home upgrades that have saved them more than $500 billion in energy costs.\n\nMoreover, the company has invested in an optimized supply chain. Actions include reducing the number of shipments (and their associated pollution) by stacking products on trucks. The Cool Down couldn't find any specific policies surrounding concrete management or disposal.\n\nWhat can be done about pollution from home projects more broadly?\n\nWhether you're taking care of your yard or making home upgrades, you can participate in mindful resource management. Doing so comes with monetary and environmental perks, too.\n\nFor instance, if you want a piece of lawn equipment that's quieter and doesn't need expensive gas \u2014 meaning it doesn't spew toxic pollution \u2014 an electric lawn mower is the way to go. If you want to spend less money on water bills, rewilding your yard with native plants can help. You'll also be providing a haven for food supply-supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "Home Depot on Tuesday topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations, even as elevated interest rates and housing prices dampened consumer demand for large remodels and pricier projects.\n\nFor the full year ahead, the company said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to increase by about 1%. Home Depot projected adjusted earnings per share will decline about 2% compared with the prior year.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said \"housing is still frozen by mortgage rates.\" Yet he said Home Depot saw broad-based growth, as sales increased in about half of its merchandise categories and 15 of its 19 U.S. geographic regions.\n\nHome Depot anticipates consumers will stop putting off projects as they gradually get used to higher interest rates, rather than waiting for them to fall, McPhail said.\n\n\"They tell us their lives are moving on,\" he said. \"Their families are growing. They're moving for a new job. They're upsizing their home. They want to upgrade their standard of living. Home improvement always persists, and so the question, I think, will be around the mindset of whether long-term rates have gotten to a new normal.\"\n\nHere's what the company reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.02 vs. $3.01 expected\n\n$3.02 vs. $3.01 expected Revenue: $39.70 billion vs. $39.16 billion expected\n\nHome Depot shares closed on Tuesday at $393.29, up nearly 3%.\n\nIn the three-month period that ended Feb. 2, Home Depot's net income climbed to $3.0 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $2.80 billion, or $2.82 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 14% from $34.79 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nComparable sales, a metric also known as same-store sales, increased 0.8% across the company. Those results ended eight consecutive quarters of falling comparable sales. They also exceeded analysts' expectations of a decline of 1.7%, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 1.3% year over year.\n\nRegions hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton contributed about 0.6% to comparable sales, McPhail said.\n\nCustomers spent more and visited Home Depot's stores and website more in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. Transactions rose to 400.4 million, up nearly 8% from the year-ago period. The average ticket was $89.11 in the quarter, up slightly from $88.87 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nHome Depot has faced a more difficult backdrop for selling supplies for home improvement projects. Sales growth slowed in 2023, after consumers' huge appetite for home renovations during the Covid pandemic returned to more typical patterns. Inflation and a shift back to spending on services like vacations and restaurants also dinged consumer demand for larger projects and pricier items.\n\nSince roughly the middle of 2023, Home Depot's leaders have pinned the company's problems on a tougher housing market. McPhail told CNBC that the same challenge persisted in the fourth quarter, as consumers still showed reluctance to splurge on bigger projects, such as redoing a kitchen or installing new flooring.",

Adjusted earnings per share grew to $3.13, up from $2.86 last year and above estimates of $3.04.\n\nHome Depot has been struggling as shoppers held off on major renovation projects thanks to high interest rates and more cautious spending overall. That pressure is expected to continue; total net sales are expected to grow 2.8% in fiscal year 2025, while same-store sales growth is expected to increase by 1%.\n\nOn the full-year outlook, CFO Richard McPhail told investors that Home Depot saw \"some benefits from hurricanes that won't fully repeat in 2025\" and that it assumes \"continued pressure on larger projects.\"\n\nTelsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients that the outlook was \"softer than expected,\" adding that the \"cautious approach in this uncertain environment makes sense and could prove conservative\" as consumers that have put off big projects over stubbornly higher mortgage rates, that executives say consumers will eventually \"get used to.\"\n\nHome Depot stock reversed early losses on Tuesday to gain more than 3.5% in afternoon trading.\n\nFor the quarter, same-store sales growth rose 0.8%, whereas Wall Street had been looking for a drop of more than 1.71% to follow the previous eight straight quarters of negative growth. Regions affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton boosted sales growth by 60 basis points, while higher foot traffic, up 7.6%, and an uptick in the average ticket size, up 0.3%, also contributed.\n\nFeldman noted that pro categories such as roofing, drywall, and lumber also boosted results.

Analysts polled by FactSet were calling for $39.15 billion.\n\nHome Depot Inc. said Tuesday that the extra week in the quarter added approximately $2.5 billion in sales for the period.\n\nSales at stores open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer\u2019s health, edged up 0.8%. In the U.S., comparable store sales rose1.3%. It is the first quarterly increase since January 2023 and much better than the 1.5% decline expected on Wall Street.\n\nThe extra week in the quarter was not included in the same-store sales results.\n\n\u201cThe fact that US comparable sales are back in the black after declining for eight quarters or two years is a very clear win for Home Depot, and it suggests that the home improvement market as a whole might finally be reaching the nadir of its more sluggish performance,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, wrote Tuesday.\n\nShares climbed more than 3% in midday.\n\nCustomer transactions rose 7.6% in the quarter. The amount shoppers spent climbed slightly to $89.11 per average ticket from $88.87 in the prior-year period.\n\n\u201cOur fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as we saw greater engagement in home improvement spend, despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects,\u201d said Chair and CEO Ted Decker said in a statement. \u201cThroughout the year, we remained steadfast in our investments across our strategic initiatives to position ourselves for continued success, despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a higher interest rate environment that impacted home improvement demand.\u201d\n\nHome improvement retailers like Home Depot have contended with homeowners putting off bigger projects due to higher borrowing costs and lingering concerns about inflation.\n\nThe U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last month as rising mortgage rates and prices put off many would-be homebuyers despite a wider selection of properties on the market.\n\nSales fell 4.9% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.08 million units, the National Association of Realtors said last week. Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 19th consecutive month. The national median sales price rose 4.8% in January from a year earlier to $396,900.\n\nSales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.\n\nDecker said during a conference call that they\u2019ve noticed fewer people moving, and also that they are also putting off repairs and remodels at the homes they currently live in.\n\n\u201cOur surveys over the prior several months, more than cost of project and higher rates, the #1 issue that people were citing in our surveys were general macroeconomic and even political uncertainty,\u201d Decker said.\n\nHome Depot earned $3 billion, or $3.02 per share, for the three months ended Feb. 2. A year earlier it earned $2.8 billion, or $2.82 per share.\n\nRemoving certain items, earnings were $3.13 per share. That\u2019s better than the $3.04 per share that Wall Street anticipated.\n\nLooking ahead, Home Depot said that it expects per-share earnings to decline about 2% this year on sales growth of approximately 2.8%.",

Home Depot also sounded an upbeat forecast for 2025, saying sales at stores open at least a year would grow by 1%.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s stock (HD) rose around 4% during early trading Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s an encouraging sign for consumer spending on their homes and big-ticket purchases. Home Depot is bellwether of the US housing market and the economy.\n\n\u201cThe fact that US comparable sales are back in the black after declining for eight quarters or two years is a very clear win for Home Depot,\u201d said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s business is closely tied to the housing market, and high interest rates have put a brake on housing turnover and consumers financing larger projects.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Home Depot finance chief Richard McPhail said \u201chousing is still frozen by mortgage rates.\u201d But he said Home Depot saw broad growth last quarter, as sales increased in about half of its merchandise categories.\n\nStill, Home Depot said it was seeing pressure on large remodeling projects, a sign consumers are strained by higher interest rates.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s results were a positive sign after Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, warned last week that 2025 would be a rockier year. Walmart said it expected sales to slow down amid concerns about inflation and tariffs. Walmart\u2019s warning drove the Dow down about 450 points Thursday, and it has fallen every day since.\n\nHome Depot said on a call with analysts Tuesday that it would be able to manage tariffs using its wide base of suppliers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently enacted a 10% across-board-tariff on goods coming from China and 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Trump plans to implement tariffs on Mexico and Canada in March and also pledged to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\n\nHome Depot was also asked on the call about immigration. The Trump administration has pledged to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\nThe company said that there is a shortage of skilled trade workers in the United States, and it was unsure how mass deportations would worsen that. Economists and housing experts say mass deportations could drive up the price of housing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about having a shortage of skilled-trades folks in this country for some time,\u201d Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said on the call. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s like 400-odd-thousand trades, folks short, and not sure how that number would change with any meaningful change in immigration.\u201d",

Home Depot\u2019s sales grew by about 1% last quarter, which seems to show things are starting to normalize, said Greg Portell, a retail consultant with Kearney.\n\n\u201cI think it is important not to confuse normalization with all of a sudden an uptick. Normalization just allows consumers to have some certainty,\u201d said Portell.\n\nNick Spector, the owner of Alair Homes in Houston, has noticed a change in his customers as the shock of inflation and higher interest rates has receded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of people you know, interested in moving forward with projects that they\u2019ve been thinking about for months or even years, in a lot of cases,\u201d said Spector.\n\nGenerally, there\u2019s an uptick in smaller scale renovations. Spector said many homeowners decided to stay put instead of looking for a new house. High prices and mortgage rates have slowed down home sales, which puts a dent in large scale remodels.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody moves into a new home, there\u2019s typically something that they want to do, whether it\u2019s, \u2018We need to blow out these walls and do some major changes,\u2019\u201d said Spector.\n\nA slow housing market will likely keep growth in home renovations low, said Michael Baker, managing director at D.A. Davidson.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re out of the woods yet, as relates to the housing market, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be getting worse, and in fact, bouncing along the bottom and maybe getting a little bit better,\u201d said Baker.\n\nHe said even if the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t cut interest rates as quickly as once hoped, rates are unlikely to go up anytime soon.\n\nThough, the new administration has introduced some uncertainties, said Kearney\u2019s Greg Portell.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for consumers is going to be, how do you interpret the headlines on things like tariffs, on things like trade, on things like immigration?\u201d said Portell.\n\nIf costs for construction labor and raw materials are unpredictable, normalization gets a whole lot harder.",

Adjusted earnings per share grew to $3.13, up from $2.86 last year and above estimates of $3.04.\n\nHome Depot has been struggling as shoppers held off on major renovation projects thanks to high interest rates and more cautious spending overall. That pressure is expected to continue; total net sales are expected to grow 2.8% in fiscal year 2025, while same-store sales growth is expected to increase by 1%.\n\nOn the full-year outlook, CFO Richard McPhail told investors that Home Depot saw \"some benefits from hurricanes that won't fully repeat in 2025\" and that it assumes \"continued pressure on larger projects.\"\n\nTelsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients that the outlook was \"softer than expected,\" adding that the \"cautious approach in this uncertain environment makes sense and could prove conservative\" as consumers that have put off big projects over stubbornly higher mortgage rates, that executives say consumers will eventually \"get used to.\"\n\nHome Depot stock reversed early losses on Tuesday to gain more than 3.5% in afternoon trading.\n\nFor the quarter, same-store sales growth rose 0.8%, whereas Wall Street had been looking for a drop of more than 1.71% to follow the previous eight straight quarters of negative growth. Regions affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton boosted sales growth by 60 basis points, while higher foot traffic, up 7.6%, and an uptick in the average ticket size, up 0.3%, also contributed.\n\nFeldman noted that pro categories such as roofing, drywall, and lumber also boosted results. E-commerce sales, which increased 9%, saw strength as well.\n\nThe results exceeded company expectations with \"greater engagement in home improvement spend, despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in the release.\n\nRead more: Best credit cards for home improvement\n\nIn fiscal 2024, net sales grew 4.5% year over year to $159.51 billion, above Wall Street's expectations.

Sure, he has moved up through the Washington Nationals organization and, as a nonroster invitee to spring training, has climbed high enough to pitch to the likes of James Wood and Dylan Crews in live bullpen sessions.\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Sports Moment newsletter (The Washington Post) Reporter Ava Wallace takes you through the buzziest, most engaging sports stories of the week. Sign up for the weekly newsletter End of carousel\n\nBut another part of Brad Lord\u2019s CV demands attention: the special skills section. He can lift heavy boxes. He can reach the top shelves. All of which made him a great fit at his other offseason workplace: Home Depot.\n\nLord, who pitched to a 2.43 ERA in 25 minor league starts in 2024 and finished the year at Class AAA Rochester, spent this winter training in the morning. And then he did what most professional athletes do not: He clocked in at 2 p.m., \u201cmoved 20 to 30 bags of mulch\u201d and clocked out at 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI mean, I guess lifting Christmas trees I got stronger,\u201d Lord said. \u201cWeird way to work out, but yeah.\u201d\n\nMLB\u2019s 2023 collective bargaining agreement increased salaries across baseball\u2019s lower levels, but the days of minor leaguers working a second job are not extinct. Lord, an 18th-round draft pick in 2022, is a 25-year-old with bills to pay. So he did what he has always had to do: a little extra work.\n\nIn the mornings, the right-hander trained with Cam Lanzilli at KineticPro Performance in Tampa, working on the shape of his slider. In the afternoons, he drove to Bradenton and put on an orange smock. As the holiday season neared, he worked the Christmas tree tent. He swept floors when there was nothing else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the Nationals\u2019 spring training complex, Lord\u2019s stocky, 6-foot-3 frame and athletic ability are quite ordinary. At Home Depot, they weren\u2019t. His co-workers pried for details. The mild-mannered Lord didn\u2019t mind.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018Man, you look like a pretty physical guy. What do you do?\u2019\u201d Lord said. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Oh, yeah. Well, I play baseball.\u2019\u201d\n\nUltimately, the job worked out because it fit with his training schedule. He liked his co-workers. It taught him time management. He couldn\u2019t think of anyone else in baseball who worked at Home Depot, which lit a fire under him. And it gave Lord, who left the gig shortly before Christmas, some time to think more deeply about his training.\n\n\u201cI probably think too much about baseball when I\u2019m stocking shelves and everything,\u201d Lord said. But he used it as time to contemplate his pitch mix and arm angle. That second piece was particularly important. Certain bodies can only move in certain ways. Before he was drafted, no one had ever told Lord how his body was supposed to move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was, until Justin Lord did. The Class A Fredericksburg pitching coach took a close look at Brad Lord two summers ago. (And, yes, they are distant cousins, something they learned while working together.) The coach saw a pitcher whose body was fighting against something in his delivery. More specifically, as Lord landed with his front foot, his shoulder angle was contradictory to his hip angle.\n\nThe pitcher was willing to try anything. So the pair worked on leveling his shoulders, having them tilt more upright than before. That, in turn, lowered his arm slot and cut the tension within his body. Within a few weeks, his velocity increased. He had a better feel for where his pitches would land. And everything was consistent.\n\n\u201cIt just fit like a glove,\u201d Brad Lord said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Lord could follow the Mitchell Parker and DJ Herz plan from last year. While he\u2019s unlikely to make Washington\u2019s roster out of camp, there is a world in which poor performance or injuries create an opening. The coaching staff at Rochester felt he would have debuted in the majors at the end of 2024 if not for a hand injury he suffered in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Lord makes it to the big leagues, it will be on the back of that work ethic and the adjustment he made with Justin Lord. He has yet to master his slider, which is gaining more bite and horizontal movement.\n\nHis most compelling pitch remains his fastball. As Lord pitched to Wood and Crews on Thursday, an onlooker noticed that Lord\u2019s delivery looked as if he was shot-putting the ball. Last year, Rochester pitching coach Rafael Chaves said traditional metrics don\u2019t suggest Lord\u2019s fastball is unusual, but the vertical approach angle makes it so hitters often swing underneath it. He throws it as soft as 91 mph and as hard as 97. It\u2019s deceptive.\n\n\u201cThe ball looks like it\u2019s coming out of his shirt,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said.",

Your yard and home might look unkempt or grimy, you might feel pressure to reorganize, do a deep cleaning and more.\n\nFortunately, Home Depot has you covered for the vast number of DIY projects spring may foist upon you, from yard clean up to readying your patio for entertaining and more.\n\nHere are seven of the best items to get you spring ready.\n\nRyobi Cordless Battery Weed Trimmer\n\nPulling weeds can be incredibly back-breaking work, especially if you\u2019re tackling a yard that hasn\u2019t seen trimming since the fall. Take some of the labor out of it with this Ryobi cordless string trimmer and edger tool. You can easily whack away weeds and trim back shrubs and bushes with this tool, and you don\u2019t even have to worry about plugging it in. It\u2019s $99 at Home Depot now.\n\nNexgrill 4-Burner Propane Gas Grill\n\nGet ready to move meals outside this spring and summer with a Nexgrill four-burner propane gas grill. Even if it\u2019s still a little too cool to eat outside, there\u2019s nothing tastier than a freshly grilled slab of meat or fish, or veggie kabobs and more. At just $229, you\u2019ll be thanking yourself later in the summer when it gets too hot to cook inside.\n\nRattan Patio Furniture Set\n\nGet ready to do more than just enjoy the spring weather through your windows \u2014 prep your patio or backyard for actual hanging out. Whether just yourself and your family or a set up for entertaining, check out Costway\u2019s four-piece rattan patio set in gray. It comes with beige cushions and an affordable price tag of just $281.\n\nJasmine Plant, Re-Blooming\n\nBeautify your backyard or patio naturally by putting out some sort of plants, trees or vines. This gorgeous re-blooming jasmine plant unfurls fragrant white flowers that can be trained to climb a trellis or fence. They smell great and the plant is lovely whether it\u2019s blooming or not. A 1-gallon vine is just $20.87 but will proliferate quickly.\n\nRed Beefsteak Heirloom Tomato Plant\n\nYou can also prepare for getting your hands dirty in a different way, through gardening. Home Depot has a lot of vegetable starts on hand, such as this two-pack of red beefsteak heirloom tomato plants, just $12.98. You don\u2019t even have to start from seeds to grow delicious veggies right in your own yard.\n\nFiberglass Handle Double Play Bow Rake\n\nIf your backyard chaos isn\u2019t quite as unruly as all that, you might just find a good old-fashioned hand tool is enough to get it back into shape. Rake away leaves, brush and debris with this Ames bow rake with fiberglass handle. It\u2019s $33.60, a lot cheaper than paying a gardener.\n\nBehr Exterior Masonry, Stucco and Brick Paint\n\nOne of the last things to get a refresh can be the outside of your home. While painting an entire home again can be quite costly, sometimes just refreshing touches here and there, such as masonry or brick, can bring a radiance back to your home\u2019s appearance. You can start with a gallon of Behr\u2019s flat exterior paint for just $29.98.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Pricing is accurate as of Feb. 20, 2025. Prices and availability are subject to change.",

PCE rose, as expected, in December and the January reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a separate inflation measure, also showed price pressures increasing more than expected.\n\nAlso this week, the consumer confidence survey on Tuesday will include data on public perceptions of inflation, which Fed officials watch as an important determinant of price increases.\n\nSeveral central bankers are expected to deliver remarks this week, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker.\n\nRevisions to fourth-quarter GDP are scheduled for Thursday.

Nvidia's profit more than doubled in the third quarter amid strong sales in its data center division.\n\nSalesforce is also slated to report results on Wednesday. The cloud software provider grew revenue by 8% and delivered better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter as it rolled out its autonomous AI agents.\n\nOther tech companies on the earnings calendar this week include software firm Synopsys and cloud-based data storage company Snowflake.\n\nDell Technologies\u2019 report is scheduled for Thursday.

This is in the midst of a sales decline, so clearly, some very specific moves are being made.\n\nKOMU Photo/ Alex Schupp\n\nWhat's Changed at Home Depot?\n\nNow, all Home Depot employees are required to work one eight-hour shift every single quarter. This is regardless of their job, or whether or not they usually set foot on the sales floor.\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nAre Any Employees Exempt?\n\nNot a soul is exempt, and that includes remote workers and senior-level management. Imagine the looks on those poor rich people\u2019s faces when they learned they may actually have to work as hard as the lower-level staff.\n\nJannHuizenga/istockphoto\n\nWhy Is Home Depot Doing This?\n\nThere is a method behind this madness; it\u2019s a good idea to bring higher-up employees down to the ground so they can understand what\u2019s truly going on in their company. It\u2019s impossible to truly strategize solutions when you\u2019ve never seen the problems firsthand. That way, when thinking about what the actual customer experiences in their store, they have something to draw from.\n\nIn a memo introducing the initiative, Chief Executive Officer Ted Decker said, \u201cWe need to stay connected to the core of our business, so we can truly understand the challenges and opportunities our store associates face every day.\"\n\nMichael C./Yelp\n\nIs This a Good Idea?\n\nThis is the type of thing that will work well if employees are excited about it, but it\u2019s safe to say nobody will be. Home Depot should prepare for horrible attitudes aplenty, and if these people don\u2019t feel prepared, it\u2019s easy to see how some of them might quit on the spot.\n\nDave Kotinsky / Getty\n\nWhat Other Companies Are Doing This?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened.

Sure, he has moved up through the Washington Nationals organization and, as a nonroster invitee to spring training, has climbed high enough to pitch to the likes of James Wood and Dylan Crews in live bullpen sessions.\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Sports Moment newsletter (The Washington Post) Reporter Ava Wallace takes you through the buzziest, most engaging sports stories of the week. Sign up for the weekly newsletter End of carousel\n\nBut another part of Brad Lord\u2019s CV demands attention: the special skills section. He can lift heavy boxes. He can reach the top shelves. All of which made him a great fit at his other offseason workplace: Home Depot.\n\nLord, who pitched to a 2.43 ERA in 25 minor league starts in 2024 and finished the year at Class AAA Rochester, spent this winter training in the morning. And then he did what most professional athletes do not: He clocked in at 2 p.m., \u201cmoved 20 to 30 bags of mulch\u201d and clocked out at 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI mean, I guess lifting Christmas trees I got stronger,\u201d Lord said. \u201cWeird way to work out, but yeah.\u201d\n\nMLB\u2019s 2023 collective bargaining agreement increased salaries across baseball\u2019s lower levels, but the days of minor leaguers working a second job are not extinct. Lord, an 18th-round draft pick in 2022, is a 25-year-old with bills to pay. So he did what he has always had to do: a little extra work.\n\nIn the mornings, the right-hander trained with Cam Lanzilli at KineticPro Performance in Tampa, working on the shape of his slider. In the afternoons, he drove to Bradenton and put on an orange smock. As the holiday season neared, he worked the Christmas tree tent. He swept floors when there was nothing else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the Nationals\u2019 spring training complex, Lord\u2019s stocky, 6-foot-3 frame and athletic ability are quite ordinary. At Home Depot, they weren\u2019t. His co-workers pried for details. The mild-mannered Lord didn\u2019t mind.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018Man, you look like a pretty physical guy. What do you do?\u2019\u201d Lord said. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Oh, yeah. Well, I play baseball.\u2019\u201d\n\nUltimately, the job worked out because it fit with his training schedule. He liked his co-workers. It taught him time management. He couldn\u2019t think of anyone else in baseball who worked at Home Depot, which lit a fire under him. And it gave Lord, who left the gig shortly before Christmas, some time to think more deeply about his training.\n\n\u201cI probably think too much about baseball when I\u2019m stocking shelves and everything,\u201d Lord said. But he used it as time to contemplate his pitch mix and arm angle. That second piece was particularly important. Certain bodies can only move in certain ways. Before he was drafted, no one had ever told Lord how his body was supposed to move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was, until Justin Lord did. The Class A Fredericksburg pitching coach took a close look at Brad Lord two summers ago. (And, yes, they are distant cousins, something they learned while working together.) The coach saw a pitcher whose body was fighting against something in his delivery. More specifically, as Lord landed with his front foot, his shoulder angle was contradictory to his hip angle.\n\nThe pitcher was willing to try anything. So the pair worked on leveling his shoulders, having them tilt more upright than before. That, in turn, lowered his arm slot and cut the tension within his body. Within a few weeks, his velocity increased. He had a better feel for where his pitches would land. And everything was consistent.\n\n\u201cIt just fit like a glove,\u201d Brad Lord said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Lord could follow the Mitchell Parker and DJ Herz plan from last year. While he\u2019s unlikely to make Washington\u2019s roster out of camp, there is a world in which poor performance or injuries create an opening. The coaching staff at Rochester felt he would have debuted in the majors at the end of 2024 if not for a hand injury he suffered in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Lord makes it to the big leagues, it will be on the back of that work ethic and the adjustment he made with Justin Lord. He has yet to master his slider, which is gaining more bite and horizontal movement.\n\nHis most compelling pitch remains his fastball. As Lord pitched to Wood and Crews on Thursday, an onlooker noticed that Lord\u2019s delivery looked as if he was shot-putting the ball. Last year, Rochester pitching coach Rafael Chaves said traditional metrics don\u2019t suggest Lord\u2019s fastball is unusual, but the vertical approach angle makes it so hitters often swing underneath it. He throws it as soft as 91 mph and as hard as 97. It\u2019s deceptive.\n\n\u201cThe ball looks like it\u2019s coming out of his shirt,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said.",

Officers rendered aid until the fire department personnel arrived, said Warner Castillo, Captain III LAPD Commanding Officer at North Hollywood Division, who briefed the news media on camera at the scene.\n\nThe victim was transported to a local hospital by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics, where he was pronounced deceased. He has not been identified at this time.\n\nIt was later learned that in addition to being shot, the victim was run over by an uninvolved party in a truck. According to Castillo, it appears the driver was unaware that he ran over anyone or anything because he parked and then went shopping.\n\nInitial investigation at the scene indicates that two males were arguing in the parking lot of Home Depot. One of the males started chasing the victim and shot him in the head, according to Castillo. The victim fell to the ground, and the suspect is still outstanding.\n\nCastillo said the community\u2019s help is needed. At the time of the incident, many witnesses were in the parking lot or shopping, but by the time officers arrived, the potential witnesses were gone.\n\nAnyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact detectives at the LAPD Operations Valley Bureau at (818) 644-8080, or submit an anonymous tip at lacrimestoppers.org .

She asked the man, Tryce Easter, for help searching for the necessary items to hang a picture frame.\n\n\u201cI could have asked a store associate and gotten the same answer, but, you know, he was tall, and handsome,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna shoot my shot.\u2019 So I did, and completely blacked out because of the nerves,\u2019\u201d she recalls.\n\nHer viral video of the moment has over 6 million views on TikTok. \u201cPOV you took the girlies advice and went searching for a blue collar man at Home Depot because dating apps suck,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBetween the clips she posted of the interaction, Ansari says she and Easter made nervous small talk.\n\n\u201cI think it clicked for him where he was like, 'Oh, I want to get her number. And so, you know, he turned around and asked,\u201d she says.\n\nEaster later texted to ask Ansari on a formal date. Ansari describes his approach as \u201cintentional\u201d which, coincidentally, she had picked as her \"word of the year\" before they met.\n\n\"On our first date, he brought me flowers. I just feel like, in the dating world, it\u2019s like, Do you want to hang out? Are you free this day? No flowers, no sweet anything,\u201d she says.\n\nThe two quickly got to know each other. \u201cHe\u2019s from East Texas, born and raised. And he\u2019s a fireman,\" Ansari shares.\n\nTryce Easter and Katelyn Ansari.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Ansari and Easter found out that they share several hobbies (like two-stepping) and run in similar social circles, just on very different schedules. \u201cHe works odd shifts. And then I have two boys, so I\u2019m not necessarily in the social scene all the time,\" she says.\n\nA few months on, the two are still dating and share snippets of their lives on social media, like their date nights and relationship advice.\n\nAnsari and Easter dancing.\n\nAnsari didn't post her now-viral video \u2014 which was sitting in her TikTok drafts \u2014 until they had made their relationship official.\n\n\u201cHe had no idea that I had these videos, and I posted the first one. I just went about my day, you know, whatever. And then I saw that it was going viral,\u201d she says.\n\nAnsari says their relationship stands out because it feels like they are growing together. \u201cI\u2019m taking it slower, and I\u2019m telling him the things that I need, and he\u2019s welcoming them in. He's like, I want you to thrive. I want you to have everything you want in life,\" she says. \u201cIt feels really nice to be enough for somebody\u201d.\n\nShe hopes her story encourages other women to get out of their comfort zones when it comes to dating.\n\nAnsari hopes her story of meeting Easter gives people \u201chope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my drive behind it. Knowing that women are feeling like they can have hope that there are still good guys out there \u2014 I love being that inspiration,\u201d she shares.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, the two appeared on TODAY to talk about their viral love story and Ansari said they're still going strong.\n\n\"I just feel like we're kind of kindred souls, so it's really nice that it was the right place, the right time. I feel like we were meant to meet,\" she said.\n\nEaster also talked about their romantic encounter and said he \"did not pick up on the fact that she (Ansari) was flirting\" with him until much later.\n\n\"We finished the exchange, and then I was like, 'OK, I'm going to go back to finishing what I was doing.' And I was like, 'Wait. Hey, can I get your number?' And she said, 'Yes.' And then we went on a couple of dates, and then I got to know her,\" he explained.\n\nWhen they went on their first date, Ansari said that she knew Easter was the right man for her when he bought her flowers.\n\n\"I was like, if he brings me flowers, this is meant to be. And, you know, I'm rushing, getting ready, because I'm always rushing, and I open the door and he has a bouquet of flowers. I just melted,\" she said.\n\nAs for their plans for Valentine's Day, well, Easter already has a surprise in store for Ansari.\n\n\"She doesn't know what's up,\" he gushed.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

Deputies arrived at 1:51 p.m. after an employee reported a shoplifting in progress. When deputies arrived, the store\u2019s assistant protection specialist, provided a detailed account of what happened.\n\nThe Home Depot employee reported that at approximately 1:49 p.m., an unknown male\u2014later identified as Ryan Anthony Miller\u2014entered the store, grabbed a shopping cart, and began loading it with various items.\n\nThe affidavit lists the stolen merchandise as follows: an M18 Fuel Packout wet/dry vacuum valued at $189, an M18 Packout fan priced at $99, two DeWalt 20v Pruner tools at $119 each, a DeWalt 20v 550 psi handgun worth $129, and a medium moving box costing $2.18. The total value of the items amounted to $657.18.\n\nAccording to the store employee, Miller then attempted to exit the store with the cart at 1:57 p.m., bypassing all checkout counters without making any effort to pay. Another Home Depot employee briefly stopped him, but Miller pushed past her with the cart and continued toward the exit. He made it through the first set of doors before being confronted by the store\u2019s protection specialist at the second set. At that point, Miller abandoned the cart and fled on foot, jumping into a white Ford Expedition and speeding away from the scene.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies quickly tracked down Miller and the vehicle at the 400 block of Layport Drive in Sebastian, where he was detained for questioning. After being read his Miranda rights, Miller reportedly confessed to authorities, admitting that he had entered Home Depot earlier that day with the specific intent to steal the items. The store employee was brought to the location and positively identified Miller as the shoplifter during a show-up identification procedure.\n\nBased on the investigation, Miller\u2019s confession, and the witness identification, deputies arrested him on charges of shoplifting and retail theft. He was transported to the Indian River County Jail for booking.\n\nAccording to jail records, Miller was arrested last year for First Degree Petit Theft and served a jail sentence of 10 days.",

            "content": "Home Depot (HD), a home improvement retailer, is set to announce its Q4 results next week on February 25 before the market opens. HD stock has gained over 10% over the past year, driven by a resilient housing market, steady consumer spending, and strong operational execution. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.03 per share, up 7% year-over-year.\n\nAlso, revenues are expected to grow by 12% from the year-ago quarter to $39.09 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page. It\u2019s important to highlight that HD has surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in all of the last nine quarters.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Views on HD Ahead of Q4 Results\n\nAhead of HD\u2019s Q4 results, Telsey Advisory analyst Joe Feldman kept an Outperform rating on the stock with a $455 price target. Feldman highlights that though consumer pressures from inflation and high interest rates remain, he sees modest upside for Q4 due to solid retail sales. Looking ahead, Feldman expects a rebound in 2025 as comparisons ease and the housing market gains strength. He also believes that rising wages and steady home prices should drive home improvement demand.\n\nSimilarly, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem raised Home Depot\u2019s price target from $440 to $450, maintaining an Overweight rating. The firm sees Q4 trends improving and expects 2025 estimates to gradually move higher.\n\nOptions Traders Anticipate a Minor Move\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry, the Options tool does this for you.\n\nIndeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting a 4.75% move in either direction.\n\nIs Home Depot Stock a Good Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on HD stock based on nine Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. The average HD price target of $451.09 per share implies 14.30% upside potential.\n\nSee more HD analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

The lawsuit says that on their days off, the two women were \"bombarded\" by calls and texts about travel planning from Blank's family office.\n\nTheir workload was increased because they were often required to cover for \"inept\" coworkers, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe women allege in the lawsuit that another of the contract flight attendants was in a romantic relationship with Blank and \"provided only limited support\" because she was scheduled on flights only when Blank was the sole passenger.\n\nThe lawsuit also says that the flight operations coordinator was in a romantic relationship with the director of aviation and that she was \"unable to perform basic tasks\" such as ordering food or booking hotels.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiff accuse AMBFO of one count of unpaid overtime and seek to recover all unpaid overtime, liquidated damages, and legal costs.\n\nA spokesperson for AMBFO declined to comment, saying it was company policy not to do so while litigation is pending.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Sales are also likely to have benefited from improved seasonal category engagement and hurricane-related demand from Helene and Milton.\n\n\n\nOn the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, Home Depot raised its fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) outlook, citing hurricane-driven demand, the inclusion of SRS results and gains from an additional 53rd week. The company anticipates a 4% year-over-year sales increase for fiscal 2024, supported by a $2.3-billion boost from the 53rd week and $6.4 billion in incremental SRS sales. Our model forecasts a 3.8% year-over-year rise in net sales for fiscal 2024 and an 11% increase for the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nHome Depot\u2019s \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment strategy, focused on supply-chain expansion, technology enhancements and digital improvements, continues to drive growth. Its interconnected retail model has been boosting online traffic and conversions, with about 50% of online orders fulfilled in stores. These trends are expected to have supported digital sales growth in the quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, persistent challenges related to higher interest rates and increased macroeconomic uncertainty are expected to have dented consumer demand for home improvement projects, hurting Home Depot\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 performance. A decline in comparable customer transactions, led by soft sales of big-ticket discretionary categories, has been hurting the overall comparable sales (comps). Additionally, elevated interest rates have been pressuring profitability.\n\n\n\nOn the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, management projected comps to decline 2.5% for fiscal 2024 (52-week period). Management anticipates net interest expenses for fiscal 2024 at $2.1 billion. Our model predicts comps to fall 2.5% for fiscal 2024 and 2.4% for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect interest and other income/expenses, net, to increase 27.9% and 18.8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nHome Depot\u2019s margins remain under pressure due to higher operating costs and expenses from the SRS acquisition. While the gross margin is affected by an adverse sales mix, lower shrink has helped offset some impacts. On the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, management projected a fiscal 2024 gross margin of 33.5% and an operating margin of 13.5%, at the low end of prior guidance. The adjusted operating margin is expected to reach 13.8%.\n\n\n\nGAAP EPS is anticipated to decline 2% year over year, improving from the prior mentioned 2-4% drop, while adjusted EPS is projected to fall 1%, better than the previously stated 1-3% decline. The 53rd week is estimated to add 30 cents per share to EPS. Our model forecasts adjusted EPS of $15.11 for fiscal 2024, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline.",

TJX and Target TGT.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nU.S. Big-Box Retailers Report Earnings: Global Week Ahead\n\nWhat can happen in this Global Week Ahead?\n\nFor traders, it's a case of which way to look next.\n\nWith their screens flooded by headlines, from tariffs, and shaky Middle East ceasefire deals, to Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThere's also:\n\n\u00b7 A G20 meeting\n\n\u00b7 Asia-Pacific central bank meetings, and\n\n\u00b7 WalMart earnings in the mix\n\nNext are Reuters\u2019 five world market themes, re-ordered for equity traders\u2014\n\n(1) Before Markets Open (BMO) on Thursday, Feb. 20th Walmart Reports\n\nWalmart's quarterly report on Thursday should shed light on the health of the U.S. consumer as Wall Street frets about strong inflation.\n\nThe retailing giant's results could highlight the impact of inflation on shopping behavior and offer early insight into the potential fallout of President Trump' tariffs.\n\nConsumer sentiment dropped in February to a seven-month low, a recent survey showed, while inflation expectations rocketed.\n\nU.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January, latest data shows.\n\nNo wonder U.S. rate cut bets are being dialed back.\n\nOther U.S. retailers reporting in coming weeks, includeHome Depot, TJX Cos. and Target.\n\nOverall, S&P500 companies are set to have increased Q4-24 earnings by +15.1% from a year earlier, against expectations of a +9.6% increase as of Jan 1st, according to LSEG IBES.\n\n(2) The Price of Gold Is Rising\u2026 and Rising\n\nThere seems to be little stopping gold's surge.\n\nA classic \"inverse\" relationship with the U.S. dollar, where the gold price drops when the U.S. currency strengthens, appears to be over.\n\nIt's not just a matter of speculators deciding that gold is the next new thing. Much of the demand stems from concern that Trump's \"America First\" policies could upend global trade, financial flows and geopolitics.\n\nThose themes might be apparent at the Feb 20th-21st G20 meeting, a gathering U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will miss.\n\nCentral banks are buying gold, partly to diversify reserves to include fewer dollars.",

The company\u2019s stocks prices were driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. Home Depot delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand.\n\n\n\nHome Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience.\n\n\n\nHD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Booking have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+36.8% vs. +27.5%). The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to the growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.\n\n\n\nSolid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are other positives. The growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company.\n\n\n\nHowever, the declining trend in agency bookings is negatively affecting its top-line growth. Also, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East region remained concerning for the company.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Booking here >>>)\n\n\n\nEaton\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. -2.6%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings were better than expected. Research and development work allows the company to develop new products and cater to a wider customer base.\n\n\n\nEaton is aided by rising demand from the new AI-data center and contributions from its organic assets. It has been expanding via acquisitions and organic initiatives. Reindustrialization and megatrends will create more opportunities for Eaton. Our model expects total revenues to improve year over year in the 2025-2027 period.\n\n\n\nHowever, Eaton\u2019s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations.

(NASDAQ: JCTC), a company committed to innovative products that enrich outdoor spaces, proudly announces a milestone of over 300 Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae in-store displays in The Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement retails stores. This achievement ahead of the fence building season will help to serve the growing demand for durable and labor-saving fencing solutions among professional contractors and DIY homeowners.\n\n\u201cReaching 334 locations between The Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement retail locations with our Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae displayer program is a significant achievement for Jewett-Cameron,\u201d said Chad Summers, CEO/President of Jewett-Cameron. \u201cOur goal is to provide both professionals and homeowners with fence solutions that last while also streamlining the installation process. We are encouraged by the enthusiasm of our retail partners to expand these displayers into more regions.\u201d\n\nInnovating Fence Installation with Lifetime Steel Posts\u00ae\n\nTraditional wood fence posts are prone to rot, decay, and fail over time. Lifetime Steel Posts\u00ae are engineered to last a lifetime, providing a maintenance-free, corrosion-resistant alternative for wood fence post construction. The Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae offers multiple lengths and is available in galvanized and black powder-coated finish with wider flange for added strength. Installation is faster and less expensive requiring smaller diameter post holes and less concrete. Additionally, Lifetime Steel Posts\u00ae can be driven directly into the ground in many parts of the country using hydraulic post drivers in a matter of seconds with no concrete needed saving professionals extensive labor time and cost.\n\nStrategic Growth and Retailer Support\n\nThis expansion is a key strategic initiative for Jewett-Cameron in 2025, focused on meeting the needs of professionals and DIYers building fences wherever they most want our products. When combined with our Adjust-a-Gate\u00ae steel frame gate kit, the result is a fence that is built to last. By increasing accessibility and education on steel fence post solutions and no-sag steel gate frames, Jewett-Cameron is helping users make a more informed choice that improves fence longevity and durability while reducing labor and maintenance costs. The company\u2019s in-store Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae display program plays a crucial role in providing customers with hands-on engagement, demonstrating the ease of installation and long-term benefits of using a Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae.\n\n\u201cAs Jewett-Cameron continues to expand, we remain committed to innovation, durability, and efficiency in fence construction. More stores are set to feature the Lifetime Steel Post\u00ae displayer throughout 2025, further solidifying our presence as a top fence post solution,\u201d Summers concluded.\n\nAbout Jewett-Cameron Trading Company\n\nJewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd.

So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 7.8% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth each year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's alarming that Home Depot's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Home Depot's P/E?\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nWe've established that Home Depot currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\n\nWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find that you need to be mindful of.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

            "content": "Shares of Home Depot (NYSE: HD) have gained 13% over the past 12 months. The home improvement retailer is scheduled to report its earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2024 on Tuesday, February 25, before market open. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect from the earnings report:\n\nRevenue\n\nAnalysts are projecting revenue of $38.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, which indicates a growth of over 11% from the same period a year ago. In the third quarter of 2024, sales increased nearly 7% year-over-year to $40.2 billion.\n\nEarnings\n\nThe consensus estimate for Q4 2024 earnings per share is $3.02, which compares to EPS of $2.82 reported in Q4 2023. In Q3 2024, EPS fell 4% year-over-year to $3.67.\n\nPoints to note\n\nLast quarter, Home Depot\u2019s sales benefited from favorable weather, which drove engagement across seasonal goods and outdoor projects. It also saw incremental sales from hurricanes. The company anticipates hurricane-related demand to continue in the fourth quarter. This demand is expected to reflect in the top line.\n\nAt the same time, larger remodeling projects may continue to face pressure from higher interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. In Q3, comp transactions were down 0.6% while comp average ticket was down 0.8%. Big-ticket comp transactions, which are ones over $1,000, were down 6.8% YoY. Larger discretionary projects, such as kitchen and bath remodels, witnessed softer engagement.\n\nHome Depot continues to see strength in its Pro customer segment. Last quarter, Pro sales were positive and outpaced the do-it-yourself, or DIY customer. The company\u2019s investments in its Pro Ecosystem, which is now in 17 US markets, are expected to continue yielding benefits. The acquisition of SRS, which gives access to the specialty trade Pro customer, provides cross-sale opportunities and competitive advantages.\n\nThe company\u2019s continued investments in its stores, product assortment, and digital capabilities are also expected to yield benefits.",

            "content": "A match-up between Amazon (AMZN -2.51%) and Home Depot (HD -4.19%) may seem odd at first blush, but I know from experience that it's not uncommon for me to decide between two very different places to put my money when making a financial decision.\n\nThese companies are both leaders in their respective markets, but their stock performance has diverged lately. So, let's look at each one to find out which is the better stock to buy right now.\n\nWhat's happening with Amazon\n\nAmazon is well known for its e-commerce platform, which has 40% of the U.S. market, compared to Walmart's 7%, but the company's handful of other services are driving much of its growth.\n\nFor example, the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), generated $28.8 billion in sales in the most recent quarter -- just 15% of total company sales -- but accounted for half of Amazon's operating income. AWS holds a 31% share of the cloud market right now, while Microsoft trails with 20%.\n\nThere's a strong case to be made that AWS could be poised for substantially more growth in the coming years. Many artificial intelligence (AI) services run on cloud computing, and as more companies and individuals tap into AI, they'll likely spend more on cloud services. Based on that demand, Goldman Sachs estimates that AI will push global cloud computing sales to $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nAmazon recently reported its fourth-quarter results, with sales rising 10% to $187.8 billion and earnings per share up 54% to $1.86, both ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimates. And the company's advertising business, once an afterthought, now has sales of $17.3 billion.\n\nWith Amazon's ability to continue posting impressive sales and earnings and its long-term potential to tap into AI cloud revenue, there's a lot to like about buying and holding this stock.\n\nWhat's happening with Home Depot\n\nHome Depot won't release its fourth-quarter results until later this month, but management has already given investors some insight into the upcoming year on the third-quarter earnings call. CEO Ted Decker said the company continues \"to see pressure on larger remodeling projects, driven by the higher interest-rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty.\"\n\nThings might not get better anytime soon, either. The latest January inflation data showed that the Consumer Price Index rose by 3% during the month, higher than expected. That news prompted Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to say that the central bank's work isn't yet done, indicating that interest rate cuts aren't on the table. Home Depot's shares fell on that news.\n\nHome sales have slumped to their lowest level in 30 years, causing pain for the home improvement chain. When people don't buy and sell homes, they have fewer DIY projects. With high interest rates likely to stick around longer, many potential homebuyers will continue to stay on the sidelines and avoid big home projects.\n\nSame-store sales fell 1.3% in the third quarter, and management estimated they'll be down 2.5% for the year. The company is optimistic that the market will eventually revive, but investors may be waiting awhile before the housing market makes a comeback. Until it does, Home Depot is in a holding pattern.\n\nThe verdict: Amazon is the better stock\n\nI'm not pessimistic about Home Depot's long-term prospects, but with the company clearly being affected by the slow housing market, I think buying Amazon is the better option right now.\n\nAdmittedly, you'll pay a bit of a premium for the company's stock right now -- its shares have a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 35 -- but with long-term prospects in AI cloud computing and its dominance in e-commerce, that should help propel Amazon.",

It's hard to determine their condition from the photo, but none appear wilted or damaged.\n\nPhoto Credit: Reddit\n\n\"What a waste of plants,\" the employee wrote in the post. \"Does every home depot do this? Throw away plants that could be donated or sold by half it's original price? Maybe I'm expecting too much from this company.\"\n\nWhile it's a disheartening scene, several commenters offered some perspective on how retail nurseries operate, revealing that plant waste is a more complex issue than it appears.\n\n\"Has nothing to do with the company, because the plants don't belong to us. We sell them on consignment,\" one commenter said.\n\nAnother Reddit user provided more clarity on the subject, writing: \"I have been a plant vendor for a long time for HD. I get so sick and tired of hearing associates say, 'that's such a shame, I can't believe you're throwing all of that away' or 'can't you donate those?'\"\n\n\"No, we can't donate them, we don't want to lose our jobs because we don't own the product. We also clearance them if we have time so it's not like we don't mark them down. Most of us plant vendors love plants and hate to cull them, but this the corporate way.\"\n\nWhy is plant waste concerning?\n\nSince plants decompose, whether in a compost bin or a landfill, it may not seem like a big deal for a store to toss them. However, each plant requires resources to grow and transport, such as land, water, labor, and energy. When they're thrown out, resources go to waste, the store must raise prices to cover the losses, and shoppers have to pay more for products.\n\nPlus, when plants break down in landfills, they release a powerful gas called methane \u2014 one of the major polluting gases responsible for our changing climate. Some plant pots are made from plastic, which also contributes to planet-warming pollution as it decomposes and leaches toxic chemicals into soil and waterways.\n\nOne dumpster full of decaying plants won't cause the climate to spiral out of control, but when you multiply that by thousands of stores generating waste every day, it can have a big impact.\n\nIs Home Depot doing anything about this?\n\nOn its website, Home Depot outlines robust sustainability goals, including reducing plastic packaging waste. It has already removed harmful materials like expanded polystyrene foam and polyvinyl chloride film from its private-brand packaging. The company aims to replace 200 million pounds of plastic with more eco-friendly materials by 2028.\n\nRegarding organic waste disposal practices, it doesn't appear the company has any mandatory policies in place.\n\nBut for over 10 years, more than 20 of its stores in Washington state have partnered with environmental solutions company Cedar Grove to turn discarded flowers, soil, and other organic products into compost. Home Depot then sells the compost, keeping millions of pounds of organic waste from rotting in landfills.\n\n\"It is cool that our waste comes back to life as a product we sell that customers love to buy,\" Jason Kirk, a store manager in Lander, Washington, said, according to the company's site.\n\nWhat's being done about plant waste more broadly?\n\nMore retailers and small nurseries nationwide are participating in composting programs, making our planet a little greener.\n\nWe can help at home by composting food scraps and dead plants, which keeps them out of landfills and saves money on lawn care if you use them for fertilizer.\n\nIf you're interested in growing plants at home sans plastic pots, there are plenty of gardening hacks you can check out that use cardboard and other nontoxic materials to help your plants thrive.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Thought that would have been a today chore, but apparently he couldn\u2019t wait \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/f0hkju2QCe \u2014 Jacqui Pearl (@JacquiPearl5) February 16, 2025\n\nTurns out, Pearl made the trip to Home Depot to buy some fencing to put around some plants that were being eaten by deer at the family\u2019s lake house on Lake Martin, according to Jacqui.\n\nKarle\u2019s report came courtesy of two Auburn fans \u2014 Mike and Tammy Thompson \u2014 from nearby Hackneyville who were blown away to see their favorite basketball coach walking the aisles of their local Home Depot.\n\n\u201cIt was about 8:45 pm,\u201d Tammy told Karle. \u201cCoach Pearl was very nice and posed for pictures with several people.\u201d\n\nPearl was just two and a half hours removed from delivering a devasting blow to rival Alabama with a dominating 94-85 victory over the second-ranked Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa. It was Pearl\u2019s second consecutive win in the Iron Bowl of Basketball series, and cemented the Tigers as the favorite to become the No. 1 overall seed in the upcoming NCAA Tournament.\n\nBruce Pearl reflects on importance of No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup against Alabama\n\nAuburn solidified itself as the No. 1 team in the country after beating No. 2 Alabama 94-85 in Tuscaloosa on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe game marked just the sixth time in history that two teams ranked No. 1 and 2 in the same state met during the regular season. To Tigers head coach Bruce Pearl, that meant almost as much to him as securing the victory.\n\n\u201cI think the thing I\u2019m proudest of is that all eyes of college basketball were on the state of Alabama and the SEC. What this conference has done in men\u2019s basketball is historic. And, you know, you never know whether or not a game can live up to the hype,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cWe were very prepared. The coaches did a great job with the game plan. The kids executed early. You\u2019ve got to play well early if you\u2019re going to win on the road.\n\n\u201cWe played well early. As you\u2019d expected, Alabama came storming back, and the place was\u2013\u2013I\u2019ve never heard Coleman this loud. But it was a really clean game. It was a really clean game, which I was pleased about. Nate talked to his team about that, because that\u2019s how the No. 1 teams in the country should act. That\u2019s how they should compete. That\u2019s how they should play. I was really pleased with that.\u201d\n\nOn3\u2019s Dan Morrison contributed to this report.",

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model .\n\nDoes the February share price for The Home Depot, Inc. ( NYSE:HD ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$25b\u00d7 (1 + 2.8%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.8%) = US$542b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$542b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$265b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$405b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$410, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nNYSE:HD Discounted Cash Flow February 15th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Home Depot as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.080. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Home Depot\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Home Depot, there are three relevant factors you should look at:\n\nRisks: We feel that you should assess the 1 warning sign for Home Depot we've flagged before making an investment in the company.

A Wemos D1 Mini was pressed into service as the controller, which was also hooked up to an HC-SR04 infrared motion sensor. This provided the capacity to trigger the lamp when it detects someone moving nearby.\n\nAlternatively, the lamp was given a time-activated mode as well. Either way, when activated, the lamp displays a range of colorful patterns on its elegant spirals, all with the aid of the popular FastLED library.\n\nThe final result is impressive\u2014it looks almost stock, except it\u2019s far more colorful and interesting to look at than the original.

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "A closely watched government inflation gauge came in hotter than expected in January, fueled in part by an uptick in housing costs. If the trend continues, it could put a damper on housing sales and home improvements.\n\nInvestors are reading the data as bad news for Home Depot (HD -4.19%), sending the home improvement giant's stock down 3% as of 10:30 a.m. ET.\n\nA sluggish outlook\n\nThe housing sector is closely linked to interest rates. For most families, buying a house -- or doing a major remodeling project -- can be the largest single expense in their lifetime. So, when rates are higher, construction and renovation activity tends to decline.\n\nRates moved higher last year as part of the Federal Reserve's effort to fight inflation. There were hopes coming into 2025 that the work was done and interest rates would move lower in the new year, but recent data has thrown that forecast into doubt.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the core price index rose 0.5% in January, the most since August 2023. A range of household expenses including gas and groceries helped fuel the gains, but shelter accounted for about 30% of the rise.\n\nOne month's data isn't enough to set policy, but if the trend continues, it would make the case for the Federal Reserve being more conservative in the months ahead. Post report, financial markets were pricing in one rate cut in 2025, down from two cuts prior to the release.\n\nShares of Home Depot, one of the largest sellers of materials for the home construction and home renovation market, got caught up in the market downdraft following the release.\n\nIs Home Depot stock a buy?\n\nTwo things can be true at once: Home Depot is both a best-in-class retailer with a bright future, and it's a company caught in a difficult macro environment. But even in a difficult operating environment, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine, and management has returned much of that cash to shareholders in recent years via dividends and by reducing the share count by 8%.\n\nFor those with a long-term mindset, the quality of Home Depot is the important thing to focus on. Buying Home Depot now should pay off over time.",

It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "When storms bear down on areas with dense populations, the impact can be severe. But while storms and other devastating weather events can cause millions of dollars worth of damage to individuals and companies, some businesses may benefit from them.\n\nFor example, engineering firms, home improvement companies, and generator manufacturers often see revenue grow as a direct result of certain weather events.\n\nStorms rarely result in comprehensive financial improvement in the long run, and companies shouldn't count on them to improve long-term revenue. But an increase in business during storm season can be enough to shift investor sentiment and cause a rally in stock values.\n\nKey Takeaways Hurricane season puts a variety of businesses and industries at risk if they fall in the path of a storm.\n\nWhile a major storm devastates many individuals and companies, a select group of businesses can thrive amid such difficult circumstances.\n\nHome improvement companies, such as Home Depot and Lowe's, tend to see strong sales in the days and weeks ahead of and just after a storm.\n\nGenerator and battery manufacturers tend to see a rise in sales as consumers seek to prepare their homes for incoming storms.\n\nCompanies that test and treat water to make sure it's drinkable, as well as engineering firms that help rebuild structures, tend to see improved sales in the aftermath of a bad storm.\n\nHome Improvement Companies\n\nThe Home Depot (HD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), and Walmart (WMT) are three companies that may see an increase in business as a consequence of a severe weather event.\n\nThe shares of these big-box retailers are generally considered to be top picks to buy ahead of a storm for the potential increase in stock value.\n\nThey can still see an increase in sales even if a weather event does not have a significant impact. That's because they sell supplies that people need before a storm, including batteries, snow shovels, generators, and various building materials used to prepare for the storm.\n\nThese companies may see an additional increase in sales post-storm if the damage is significant as consumers purchase materials needed to clean up and rebuild.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, with the worst stretch occurring in August through late October.\n\nGenerator Companies\n\nIf a storm results in significant power losses, demand for generators increases. Generator manufacturers like Generac Holdings (GNRC) usually benefit.\n\nGenerac is one of the largest publicly traded manufacturers of home backup generators and was the first company to engineer affordable home standby generators.\n\nThe company provides portable, residential, commercial, and industrial generators in high demand if a weather event results in power outages.\n\nEngineering Companies\n\nEngineering companies often benefit from rebuilding efforts after major storms. These companies include AECOM (ACM) and Fluor (FLR).\n\nBoth of them are major government contractors, which means they can potentially benefit from federal disaster relief.\n\nFluor also has a diverse business, which includes engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, commissioning and maintenance, and project management services. All of them may see additional revenue following major storms.\n\nAECOM's business is equally diverse, providing services for projects, including highways, bridges, government and commercial buildings, water facilities, and power transmission and distribution.\n\n$1.2 trillion The total amount of funding allocated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which was signed by President Joe Biden on Nov. 15, 2021. The bill commits more than $50 billion in funding toward climate change by providing protection against weather-related incidents like droughts and floods, as well as wildfires.\n\nBattery Makers\n\nBattery sales usually increase before storms are expected as consumers stock up on batteries to power their flashlights and radios.\n\nEnergizer Holdings (ENR), with its rabbit mascot that keeps on going, may also keep on rising following such events.\n\nWhen you think of household batteries, Panasonic and Duracell may also come to mind. Berkshire Hathaway acquired battery company Duracell from Procter & Gamble (PG) in 2016 by buying all remaining shares.\n\nNote Insurance companies today are often well-prepared for severe weather events and have effective risk management strategies in place (such as reinsurance) that allow them to weather the storm successfully. Ultimately, the impact of weather events on insurance company stocks will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including the company's overall financial health, its risk exposure, and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nWater Solution Companies\n\nClean water shortages can occur when a major storm hits, especially if floodwater affects public drinking water. Companies that can test and treat water, as well as transport it, are needed and are often contracted by the government to help in these cases.\n\nOne of the leaders in the area of water treatment is Xylem (XYL), making it a company to watch during the storm season.\n\nPrimo Water (PRMB) is a leading provider of water dispensers, purified bottled water, and self-service refill drinking water in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe company's extensive distribution network allows it to quickly provide clean drinking water to affected areas during water shortages caused by storms or other disasters.\n\nProperty Casualty Insurers\n\nMajor weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, can have a significant impact on the insurance industry, which includes companies like Allstate (ALL), Progressive (PGR), Travelers (TRV), and Chubb (CB).\n\nAfter a major event, if an insurance company experiences a high number of claims or pays out substantial amounts in damages, its profitability may suffer.\n\nThis, in turn, can lead to a decline in the company's stock price, as investors may perceive the company as being at greater risk or less financially stable.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of a severe weather event, the demand for insurance typically increases as individuals and businesses seek to protect themselves from future losses.\n\nThis surge in demand is often driven by a heightened awareness of the risks associated with natural disasters and a desire to mitigate potential financial losses in the event of another catastrophe.\n\nAs the demand for insurance rises, insurance companies often respond by increasing their rates, and potentially long-term growth.\n\n\n\nHow Do Natural Disasters Affect the Economy? In the short term, natural disasters can cause significant economic disruption. Damaged infrastructure, business closures, and displaced residents can lead to reduced economic output, higher unemployment, and decreased consumer spending. However, the severity of the impact depends on factors such as the scale of the disaster, the region affected, and the state of the economy before the event. While the immediate impact of natural disasters is typically negative, there can be some positive economic effects in the medium to long term. Reconstruction efforts can stimulate the construction industry and create jobs. Upgraded infrastructure can improve productivity and efficiency while buffering against future disasters. Insurance payouts and government aid can provide a temporary boost to consumer spending. However, these positive effects do not negate the overall economic damage caused by disasters.\n\nWhich Industries or Sectors Are Most Sensitive to Natural Disasters? Industries that are directly exposed to the physical impacts of natural disasters, such as insurance, energy, and transportation, are often the most vulnerable. Insurance companies face higher claims and payouts, energy companies may experience production disruptions, and transportation networks can suffer damage. Other sectors, like retail and tourism, can also be affected if a disaster occurs in a key market or destination.\n\nWhich Sectors Are Most Resilient to Natural Disasters? Some sectors may see increased demand following a natural disaster. Construction and building materials companies often benefit from the need to rebuild damaged properties and infrastructure. Generators and backup power providers may see a surge in sales. Discount retailers can also begin to attract more cost-conscious consumers. However, the overall market impact depends on the specific circumstances of each disaster.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, and so too do storm clouds that promise hurricanes and flooding.\n\nWhile natural disasters can be costly for individuals and larger regions, they can also be a boon to investors in certain industries or sectors that are well-positioned to profit from such calamities.\n\nBattery and generator manufacturers and engineering and water works services, among others, are often examples of these types of companies.",

            "content": "Open this photo in gallery: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detain a man after conducting a raid at the Cedar Run apartment complex, in Denver, Colo., on Feb. 5.Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nThe small patches of ground where migrants have gathered on the edges of Home Depot stores in the greater Denver area have always been difficult places to find work. Men come here seeking odd jobs from customers passing by \u2013 painting, moving furniture, shovelling snow \u2013 in hopes of earning enough to feed themselves and perhaps send money to family still in distant countries.\n\nThey wait on these slivers of unoccupied space, wedges of grass or landscape stone that mark the only places they can stand between local roads and the privately held store parking lots where they are not welcome.\n\nStanding there means growing comfortable with being exposed, especially to the elements, with little shelter against the winter winds.\n\nBut Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has brought a perilous new form of exposure: At any moment, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement could swoop in.\n\nThousands of migrants have been arrested across the United States in the weeks since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Many more have gone into hiding, leaving church pews empty, workplaces vacant and grocery stores with fewer customers. In Denver, public schools reported a significant decrease in attendance last week after a high-profile migrant raid.\n\nYet every day, people from Venezuela, Mexico and Nicaragua continue to make their way to Denver\u2019s Home Depots, where places that have offered opportunity now stand as emblems of determination \u2013 and vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThere are many people just like me who live day to day,\u201d says Junior, a Venezuelan man who is out nearly every day. \u201cIf we lock ourselves inside, we do not eat.\u201d\n\nCanada faces calls to suspend asylum agreement with U.S., saying Trump orders undermine migrants\u2019 rights\n\nMore than 40,000 migrants have come to Denver since 2022. Authorities, like any city resident, know some gather at the Home Depots.\n\nThey could \u201carrive at the most unexpected moment,\u201d says Junior, who does not possess immigration papers. The Globe and Mail is not publishing his full name, or those of other migrants interviewed for this story, because they fear deportation.\n\nThe Denver area has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most pressing aims in his bid to deport migrants.\n\nIn an October campaign stop, he warned Coloradans about what he called \u201can army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world,\u201d who had been \u201cresettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens.\u201d\n\nThe White House has made clear it will treat anyone who crossed the border illegally as a criminal. In neighbourhoods across the country, federal agents are raiding homes, churches and businesses. They have warned they are prepared to seize migrants from hospitals, schools and even school buses.\n\nThe aim is to \u201cget as many criminals as possible,\u201d Tom Homan, Mr. Trump\u2019s border czar, told NBC News.\n\nFor migrants, authorities are not the only worry. They also fear the forces unleashed by Mr. Trump, who won re-election in part by placing blame on migrants for a raft of U.S. social and economic problems.\n\n\u201dI sometimes think he is crazy, because he is creating hatred amongst us,\u201d says Kendry, a 37-year-old from Caracas who arrived a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that a xenophobe will come, a person who doesn\u2019t like that we are here,\u201d he says.\n\nKendry once hoped that his wife and children could join him. Now, his ambition is merely to remain in the U.S. himself. He has already sent home US$4,000, and comes to Home Depot with a small satchel slung across his shoulder. Inside, he keeps documentation proving he has applied for asylum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not illegal,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I have immigration papers.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump has moved quickly to pare back promised protections. His administration halted a humanitarian parole program for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, creating legal limbo for hundreds of thousands already in the U.S.\n\nICE to use U.S. military base in Colorado to detain migrants\n\nAllowing Venezuelans to remain is \u201ccontrary to the national interest,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security ruled earlier this month, citing the presence of Venezuelan gang members on U.S. soil. Last week, authorities conducted a raid in the Denver area against what they said were more than 100 members of the Tren de Aragua gang; they confirmed one gang-related arrest.\n\nMr. Trump has blamed the policies of Joe Biden, who was president when millions entered the U.S. without authorization. Many believed they could find a way to stay. Mr. Trump is upending those hopes, partnering with local law enforcement to assist in rounding up people for deportation and empowering federal agents to assist in immigration enforcement.\n\nAmong those who have arrived from Venezuela is Jesus, 26. He came to Colorado in 2023, propelled by sorrow and ambition after his wife died of cancer. The family did not have enough money to pay for treatment. The U.S. offered the possibility of a more prosperous future.\n\nHe now spends many of his days at a local Home Depot, jogging to any open car window in hopes someone needs help with painting or a construction project.\n\nJesus stands out because he has learned enough English to hold a fluent conversation.\n\nIt has, of late, been little help. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, he might have secured a day or two of employment each week. But since Jan. 20, \u201cthere is no more work.\u201d A few weeks ago, a stranger yelled at him to go back to his country, calling him \u201cBlack stupid trash.\u201d\n\nThe threat of deportation has grown real. A friend was arrested in California while waiting at a gas station to be picked up for work, he said.\n\nStill, Jesus keeps coming to Home Depot. As he waits, he contemplates what to do if authorities come for him, too.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do is run away while we can and hide. All in order to stay here in the United States of America,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything else.\u201c",

Wall Street was mixed Tuesday as the market continued to digest the latest twists and turns in President Donald Trump 's trade tariffs, both implemented and threatened. Delivering his semiannual economic assessment to senators Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said central bankers don't \"need to be in a hurry\" to lower interest rates further. Powell goes before House members Wednesday shortly after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the consumer price index (CPI) report. The second key inflation report of the week, the producer price index (PPI), is out Thursday. Club name DuPont jumped more than 7% on a solid earnings report. Club names GE Healthcare and Palo Alto Networks report their quarterly results on Thursday before and after the bell, respectively. 2. Alibaba will make AI features for Apple's iPhone in China, according to The Information . The tech outlet reports that Apple and Alibaba have submitted AI features for approval by a Chinese regulator. Why does this matter? Apple said on its earnings call that in markets where Apple Intelligence is available, the Apple 16 phone sold better, Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, reminded us Tuesday. If Apple can get AI approval in China, this could be what is needed to get iPhone sales in the world's second-largest economy back on track. 3. Another research firm was raising its fourth-quarter same-store sales estimate on Home Depot to positive territory. This time it was Truist, which followed JPMorgan on Monday. The Club moved out of Stanley Black & Decker last Tuesday, put more money in Home Depot to keep our exposure to the home improvement space with less tariff risk. Home Depot is set to report earnings before the opening bell on Feb. 25. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, HD. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

It offers an everyday discount that the other card lacks (though this discount can\u2019t be combined with a financing offer).\n\nHowever, the choice depends on which store you use. If you primarily shop with Home Depot, The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card may make more sense. Home Depot has a slight edge over Lowe\u2019s in that it has a larger footprint, with more than 2,300 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico (versus around 1,700 Lowe\u2019s stores in the U.S.). If you live in an area without a Lowe\u2019s, The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card may be the better option by default.\n\nStill, neither of these cards may be the best credit card for you. Instead, consider a general-purpose card with a 0% intro APR and a sign-up bonus \u2014 that way, you won\u2019t have to worry about incurring deferred interest. Or, consider a cash back credit card that has a high rewards rate on general purchases.",

            "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Wall Street was higher Monday as the S & P 500 and Nasdaq looked to kick off the week on a positive note. The prior two Mondays were marked by sell-offs on DeepSeek AI fears on Jan. 27 \u2014 and then, on Feb. 3, on concerns about tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports that President Donald Trump eventually put on pause. Within the S & P 500 on Monday, it was shaping up to be a \"rotational day,\" Director of Portfolio Analysis Jeff Marks said, as the financial and health-care sectors pulled back after a strong start to the year. To that end, Club names Wells Fargo and Bristol Myers Squibb were among the worst-performing portfolio stocks in the session. 2. Home Depot shares rose more than 1% after analysts at JPMorgan added the retailer's stock to what is essentially their list of best investment ideas. The firm now projects that Home Depot's same-store sales in the U.S. rose 1% in the three months ended in January, solidly ahead of the Wall Street consensus for a 2.4% decline. Home Depot has not reported positive same-store sales, a key retail industry metric, since the third quarter of 2022. \"We've been waiting for this inflection,\" Jeff said. We added to our Home Depot last week , due in part to our belief that it will benefit from the wildfire rebuild in Los Angeles. Home Depot is set to report fourth-quarter numbers before the opening bell Feb. 25. 3. Nvidia is one of our best-performing Club stocks Monday, up more than 3%. The advance comes after Evercore ISI added the artificial intelligence chipmaker to its \"tactical outperform\" list. It also builds on the stock's robust four-day win streak that began last week as key Nvidia customers \u2014 Alphabet- owned Google and Amazon \u2014 joined Microsoft and Meta Platforms in saying they planned to spend heavily on AI-related capital expenditures this year, helping quell concerns sparked by DeepSeek. \"Just a very encouraging sign\" for Nvidia and the other chip stocks linked to the AI trade, Jeff said. Fellow Club AI chipmaker Broadcom also was having a strong day. We also own Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. By the way, a higher close for Meta on Monday would be 16 straight winning sessions.

            "content": "Shaquille O\u2019Neal partners with companies that resonate with him, such as JCPenney, where O\u2019Neal remembers shopping with his mother.\n\nBetween Tool Shaq (Home Depot), Shaq-A-Licious (Hershey\u2019s), Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool (TNT) and Shaquille O\u2019Deal (Klarna) \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the Shaq-berg \u2014 the most visible brand in the NBA is 7-foot-1 and 14 years into retirement.\n\nShaquille O\u2019Neal also answers to Dunk Man (Reebok), DJ Diesel (at Wynn Resort) and Chief Fun Officer (Carnival Cruise Line), which is another way of saying marketing is in the eye of the beholder. Some people become walking billboards naturally, while others learn fortuitous licensing lessons along the way, and O\u2019Neal is a combination of both: a converted mumbler/soft talker whose overall net worth is likely pushing $1 billion.\n\n\u201cI always had a fear of disappearing, and fear keeps me working hard,\u201d O\u2019Neal said, taking a break from a five-hour, hurry-up-and-wait commercial shoot. \u201cI want to have my name live forever.\u201d\n\nBut, to understand it all, you have to go back forever, back to when he was about 14, back to when he would fold himself every night into a narrow single bed at an army barracks. He called it a \u201cKarate Kid upbringing,\u201d and the truth was his stepfather Sgt. Phillip Harrison \u2014 the dragon who helped raise him \u2014 would often grab him by nape of the neck and grant him wisdom in the form of a scolding. His acquaintances will tell you that\u2019s why Shaq mumbled \u2014 because talking back to Phil Harrison would\u2019ve been hazardous to his health. So he shut up and obeyed the mouth that roared, a mouth that never roared louder than in the summer of 1986.\n\nHis father, Phil Harrison, was a tough Army sergeant who taught O\u2019Neal the importance of helping others. NBAE via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe worst ass-whupping I got \u2014 and I\u2019m glad he did it \u2014 was when Len Bias passed away,\u201d O\u2019Neal said, his eyebrows furrowing. \u201cMy father comes in, f****n\u2019 furious. Military fatigues on. He just f****n\u2019 grabs me, and he \u2026 not really beat me up, but he\u2019s just punching me. He said, \u2018If you ever f****n\u2019 do coke, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I drink Pepsi.\u2019 He\u2019s, \u2018No, motherf****r, cocaine.\u2019 So now I had to sit down with him, and we watched the tragedy of Len Bias. It felt like Len was my brother. My father was, \u2018Are we f****n\u2019 good? Don\u2019t you ever.\u2019 I mean, I tried weed one time, but all that hard shit? No, never.\n\n\u201cHe was saying, \u2018That mother****** had $50 million, and he died from coke. If you ever get that much money and lose it, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 So that discipline and that fear always taught me that, \u2018Hey man, gotta do right. Let me live forever. Let me figure a way to stay famous.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo this is all about how he figured it out.\n\n*****\n\nHe\u2019ll never forget his mom digging into her purse. Digging, digging, sighing, sighing and \u2026 coming up with all of $14.\n\nThey would be out shopping, maybe at JCPenney, and Lucille O\u2019Neal would inevitably tell the cashier, \u201cI\u2019d like to buy this on layaway. Here\u2019s $14.\u201d Her son Shaquille would stare at the ground.\n\n\u201cBecause at that moment, she would never smile,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when all the brothers and sisters started coming, and I didn\u2019t really get nothing, she\u2019d be, \u2018Baby, your sisters want the Barbie and the Barbie house. I\u2019ll get you next payday.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy best Christmas present was a Dr. J ball and a little double cassette radio. Like I said, she always had to put stuff on layaway. I used to always see her \u2014 not sad \u2014 but working a lot. But she was the only one who\u2019d believe in my cockamamie dreams.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal grew up watching his mother, Lucille O\u2019Neal, stretch dollars and put purchases on layaway. NBAE via Getty Images\n\nTheir conversations back then were gold, a preview \u2014 whether she knew it or not \u2014 of what was looming ahead:\n\n\u201cMom, when I get rich, I\u2019m going to have 10 cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, when I get rich, I\u2019m going to have my own plane.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, when I get rich, I\u2019m going to buy you the biggest house wherever we live at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, baby.\u201d\n\nBy the time he was a freshman at LSU, now a suave 7-footer with pogo sticks for legs, the layaways and the sergeant were ingrained in his mind as he considered a pro career. His coach in Baton Rouge, Dale Brown, introduced him to his eventual agent Leonard Armato, who remembers an introverted Shaq saying, \u201c\u2018Nice to meet you,\u2019 like he\u2019d been trained in the Army.\u201d Well, he was. Brown then put Armato on the phone with Harrison, and Sarge\u2019s first comments to Armato were no holds barred:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk to people over the phone. I like to talk to people eyeball to eyeball. If you want to talk, come down to Fort Sam Houston, Tuesday, 1900 hours. If you\u2019re going to be there, tell me. If not, we\u2019ll say goodbye now.\u201d\n\nSo Armato met Harrison that Tuesday at 1900 hours sharp, saw Shaq\u2019s single bed and modest barracks. On another visit, the two went driving, and when they saw a disheveled man on the side of the road, Harrison slammed the brakes.\n\n\u201cYou need some shoes?\u201d Harrison asked. \u201cYou need some shirts?\u201d\n\nHarrison popped open his trunk and handed the man a mini-wardrobe. But, as Armato found out, Harrison had already been doing this tenfold with Shaq. When Shaquille broke his hand as a 9-year-old, Sarge took him to the hospital to get a cast and stopped by the children\u2019s ward on the way out.\n\n\u201cWhy we visiting sick kids?\u201d Shaq asked.\n\n\u201cBecause these kids are less fortunate,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cShow them respect \u2014 they\u2019d love to play ball, too, and you\u2019re out here bullshitting.\u201d\n\nAnother time, Harrison made teenage Shaq wake up at 5 a.m. to donate clothes to the Salvation Army.\n\n\u201cWhy am I up this early?\u201d Shaq asked him.\n\n\u201cMan, because these people have nothing. If you ever make it big time and you can take care of somebody, you do it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal is known to frequently cover the purchases of others while he\u2019s out shopping. YouTube\n\nSo that\u2019s the Shaq who was arm-in-arm with Armato as he entered the NBA in 1992. Armato had actually figured him out early, on a day Shaquille invited him out for a drive in his souped-up van. Where there used to be upholstery, there were speakers, and the big man jacked up the volume so loud to the Cypress Hill song, \u201cHow I Could Just Kill a Man,\u201d that Armato remembered his \u201cwhole body shaking.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Armato decided Shaq \u2014 who stuttered at the time \u2014 was \u201ca cross between the Terminator and Bambi,\u201d and he was going to market him under the premise of: vulnerability equals power. It was the early \u201990s, when Michael Jordan was painting the world with his Jumpman logo, and Armato said he told Shaq: \u201cMJ doesn\u2019t own his own IP, doesn\u2019t own his own brand. It\u2019s owned by Nike. \u2026 So let\u2019s do something different, where we can control everything and license everything. And not only control the narrative, but control your brand.\u201d\n\nTo be taken seriously, Shaq needed his own logo, and Lee Clow \u2014 the eclectic creative director at the ad agency Chiat/Day \u2014 sketched \u201cDunk Man,\u201d a recreation of Shaq\u2019s spread-eagle dunk that shattered backboards. Chiat/Day also represented Reebok, and Shaq ended up licensing the logo to Reebok for his first Shaq Attaq sneaker in 1992. He then licensed Dunk Man to Pepsi and EA Sports, all part of his burgeoning \u201cShaq Brand.\u201d He cut a platinum rap album with Jive Records in \u201993 under the pseudonym \u201cShaq Diesel,\u201d which meant he wasn\u2019t only teammates with Penny Hardaway, but with Justin Timberlake. He endorsed Icy Hot after it soothed his sore quad one game. And then he remembered the layaways.\n\nThe story Shaq tells is that a woman cursed him out one day in 1998 for endorsing unaffordable $200 Reeboks she couldn\u2019t buy for her kid. Although that scene is somewhat hyperbolic \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s the embellisher of all time,\u201d Armato said, laughing \u2014 the truth is Shaquille later co-signed a deal to sell a subset of Dunk Man sneakers mass market for between $19 and $29 at Walmart. Roughly 400 million sold. The whole time, he visualized Lucille digging through her purse. So, for his entire 19-year playing career, Shaq really was part-Terminator/part-Bambi.\n\nUntil his Achilles gave out.\n\n*****\n\nShaq was also part-human, it turned out. He had originally planned a full two-decade career, with a final leaguewide \u201cShaq 20\u201d tour complete with rocking chairs and parting gifts. But his injury cheated him out of the seasonlong goodbye \u2014 and some brands saw it coming.\n\nHe remembers finishing up as a role player with the Celtics, circa 2011, \u201cwhen I wasn\u2019t the Shaq anymore.\u201d His endorsements were drying up, and he said his rudest awakening was the day a shoe rep (which he won\u2019t name) told him, \u201cI\u2019m paying you $10 million, but if you don\u2019t make the All-Star Game, I\u2019m only paying you $7 million.\u201d Shaq stared at the ground again. \u201cIt was like I was starting to fade away,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and Armato had parted ways in 2006 \u2014 it was just time \u2014 and his new representatives, Colin Smeeton and Perry Rogers (alongside Lance Klein at William Morris Endeavor), piqued his interest when they said both TNT and ESPN wanted him for their studio shows. But wasn\u2019t he too much of a soft talker?\n\nBoth networks flew to L.A. for back-to-back recruiting pitches at WME offices, although each had different blueprints. Then-ESPN President John Skipper wanted to prop up Shaq as the centerpiece of their NBA coverage \u2014 make him Shaq-tacular \u2014 while then-Turner President David Levy took a more whimsical approach. He had flown in with his A-list executives at the time: head of network programming Steve Koonin; creative director Craig Barry; Tara August, senior vice president of talent relations/special projects; and Turner Sports President Lenny Daniels. The plan was to not only dangle a chair on the \u201cInside the NBA\u201d studio set, but a potential Shaq cartoon character, a pilot for truTV or perhaps an irreverent show on the WB. Now all Levy needed was a speech.\n\nThe night before the meeting, they had all curiously asked him: \u201cWhat\u2019s your opening line gonna be, Levy? What\u2019s your angle?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it flooded to him the minute Shaq walked in immaculately dressed (as usual) in a tailored suit.\n\n\u201cShaq, there are networks that want you, and networks that need you,\u201d Levy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you.\u201d\n\n(Awkward silence.)\n\n\u201cBut we want you,\u201d Levy continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all here. I already have an Emmy Award-winning show, so there\u2019s more risk maybe on my side than on your side. I\u2019m willing to take that risk. Because we want you. But we don\u2019t need you.\u201d\n\nThe meeting proceeded from there, with Levy and crew emphasizing they wanted to \u201cbe in the Shaq business.\u201d In the end, they wished him luck in his ESPN meeting, although Levy wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d already blown it with his \u201cWe don\u2019t need you\u201d line. Until he felt \u201ca big paw\u201d on his shoulder as he headed for the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Shaq told him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have another meeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. But I\u2019m just letting you know, I\u2019m coming to TNT. No one\u2019s ever told me my whole life they don\u2019t need me.\u201d\n\nShaq later instructed Smeeton, Rogers and Klein to cut a Turner deal and asked for Skipper\u2019s phone number. He wouldn\u2019t even let ESPN make an offer. He just thanked Skipper and let him know he\u2019d be joining Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.\n\n\u201cLike ESPN is cool, but I would\u2019ve definitely sucked at that job,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cIt probably would\u2019ve started off OK with a lot of hype, but at [TNT] I don\u2019t need to carry it by myself. Like, Ernie\u2019s the man, Chuck\u2019s there. I was going to be a role player.\u201d\n\nIf TNT didn\u2019t get rid of him first.\n\n*****\n\nTNT was the fork in Shaq\u2019s road. If he nailed the job, his teetering Shaq Brand IP would stay relevant. If he bombed, he would conceivably slip into oblivion.\n\n\u201cI wanted people to remember my name,\u201d he said. \u201cMy favorite song growing up was \u2018Fame.\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019m on Hollywood Boulevard one day, and I see Elvis shit. Everything. Elvis cups, f****n\u2019 hats. And I\u2019m saying to myself: \u2018This dude\u2019s been dead for 60 years. How does he do it?\u2019 And I had my team do research. And I realized you have to get with a big company to live forever. \u2014 Shaquille O'Neal\n\nThe lead producers at Turner, led by the inventive Tim Kiely, intended to break him in the same way they broke in Barkley and Smith. No staring at Camera 1 or 2. Just be his fool self.\n\n\u201cBut, first year, I was terrible,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cI was on there like Bryant Gumbel, trying to be intelligent. And [Kiely] brought me in and said, \u2018We didn\u2019t bring you here for that shit.\u2019 He said, \u2018Be you.\u2019 I said, \u2018Be me?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yeah. Just talk, tell stories. I don\u2019t want all that intelligent shit.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis start with \u201cInside the NBA\u201d was a gamble for TNT and a near disaster for O\u2019Neal. Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nIn some ways, Kiely\u2019s hide was on the line. Shaq\u2019s first season of 2011-12 had coincided with a 161-day NBA lockout, meaning he had no practice games and debuted on the Christmas Day season opener. Kiely just figured they\u2019d wing it. When Shaq was introduced on the first show, Barkley and Smith imitated his mumble. But when those two started talking regular again, Shaq kept mumbling.\n\n\u201cI was terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to figure the niche. I thought it was something where Ernie asked you a question and [you answer]. But we were so all over the place, we don\u2019t practice anything. I was awful.\u201d\n\nAfter about three months of Shaq\u2019s garbled opinions and forced humor, Levy said, \u201cI was really thinking about making some changes, let\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d Kiely flew from Atlanta to New York to discuss Shaq\u2019s future, and, according to Levy, the producer said, \u201cGive me time. I see brilliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, dude, this is tough right now,\u201d Levy said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I know there\u2019s brilliance there,\u201d Kiely said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to re-think how we use him.\u201d\n\nThe revisions were subtle. They turned up his mic. Instead of Johnson cuing him up after Barkley and Smith, he\u2019d cue up Shaq first. They told him not to talk X\u2019s and O\u2019s, but about life in the locker room. He\u2019d just left the league; that was to Shaq\u2019s advantage.\n\n\u201cI sat Shaq down to say, \u2018Look, Shaq, you gotta act like you\u2019re screaming, because you gotta cut through Barkley, you gotta cut through music, you gotta cut through natural sound,\u2019\u201d Kiely said. \u201cAnd he started to get it, started to sound pretty good. Then all sudden, one halftime, he mailed it in. And me being the genius I am, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Whoa, great teaching moment, right?\u2019 So I run downstairs and grab him, and I\u2019m screaming at him because that\u2019s what he responds to. He responded to Pat Riley screaming at him, and Sarge. I\u2019m calling him every name in the book. I\u2019m saying \u2018We talked about this, this, this.\u2019 Here I am, 5-11, yelling at this 7-foot monster.\n\n\u201cI finally said, \u2018Are we good?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re good.\u2019 And as I turned around, he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and back of my belt and pressed me over his head. I\u2019m 7 feet off the ground. And I\u2019m not skinny, I\u2019m not afraid to tell you that. And I\u2019m hanging up here. And I said it again, \u2018Are we all good?\u201d He said, yep, and he put me down like a little baby, like he was holding a feather. We had the greatest relationship in the world.\u201d\n\nTerminator/Bambi was back, and Shaq began relying on slapstick, tripping over cords and asking Kiely to make Christmas trees fall on top of him. He\u2019d talk on-air what it was like to deal with Hack-a-Shaq as a player and began his \u201clittle disrespectful-respectful\u201d arguments with Barkley.\n\n\u201cAnd, at times, I\u2019d be silly and laugh,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cI realized if we\u2019re going to keep these people up from 7 to 2, we gotta entertain. Charles is going to go over the line, I\u2019m going to touch the line, Ernie\u2019s going to bring it back down to equality. And nobody knows what Kenny is talking about. It makes it a great show.\u201d\n\n\u201cInside the NBA\u201d was his post-retirement breakthrough, the \u201chub of his wheel,\u201d according to Smeeton. By 2015, TNT had re-introduced Shaq Diesel to a new iteration of fans and brands who\u2019d either never seen him shatter a rim or forgotten he\u2019d once ruled the league. He intended to capitalize \u2014 at a time his only deals were with Icy Hot, Gold Bond, Reebok and NBA 2K \u2014 and then he remembered the time he\u2019d taken his kids to Mann\u2019s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on Hollywood Boulevard one day, and I see Elvis shit,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cEverything. Elvis cups, f****n\u2019 hats. And I\u2019m saying to myself: \u2018This dude\u2019s been dead for 60 years. How does he do it?\u2019 And I had my team do research. And I realized you have to get with a big company to live forever.\u201d\n\nThe more his team ruminated over it, there was no better company than Authentic Brands Group, which actually owned the estate of Elvis, not to mention Marilyn Monroe. Authentic had never licensed a living brand, but its Chairman and CEO Jamie Salter realized quickly that Shaq was, literally and figuratively, larger than life.\n\nAuthentic Brands Chairman and CEO Jamie Salter (left) saw O\u2019Neal as a larger-than-life opportunity for dealmaking. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThey struck a partnership in 2015 that turned O\u2019Neal into the second-largest individual shareholder in the company (behind only Salter), the majority of his transaction containing ABG stock. While Authentic would control and grow Shaq\u2019s IP, Shaq would have ownership in its wide portfolio of brands such as Brooks Brothers, Quiksilver, Billabong, Eddie Bauer and Nautica. \u201cWe needed to pivot his business from making money when he was working to making money when he was sleeping,\u201d Smeeton said.\n\nShaq wasn\u2019t just some jock voice in the board room, either. He had ideas, novel ones, much of them personal. For instance, he began to tell Salter and Co. about Lucille, the layaways and Sarge.\n\nAbout his Karate Kid upbringing.\n\n*****\n\nHe paid it forward, all while getting paid.\n\nUntil Authentic arrived, Shaq\u2019s licensing business consisted of just footwear, jewelry, eyewear and, most of all, dress suits. Big and tall suits. The kind of suits he wore twice a week on \u201cInside the NBA.\u201d From a store that touched his inner child: JCPenney.\n\n\u201cMost big and tall lines are boring,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cBut they let me do sexy shit.\u201d\n\nWhereas 90% of O\u2019Neal\u2019s deals were once endorsements, Authentic Brands has flipped it to about 50% endorsements and 50% entertainment, media and licensing. But whenever deciding to strike a deal, he won\u2019t let anyone on his team tell him how much it\u2019s worth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be motivated by money.\u201d Instead, he\u2019s motivated by charm.\n\nHe could have partnered with any retailer, but he chose JCPenney because it reminded him of Lucille, of staring at the ground. When Authentic entered the picture, they doubled down on the partnership. His new Shaquille O\u2019Neal XLG line (with even cream-colored suits) sold through, which Smeeton called a defining moment. They knew licensing was Shaq\u2019s ticket to immortality, and Authentic soon had JCPenney expanding to Shaquille O\u2019Neal XLG underwear, sleepwear and footwear, not to mention Shaquille O\u2019Neal fine necklaces and pendants. He was the face of the place.\n\nAt that point, Shaq would make deals (and influence people) wherever the wind blew him. But it was always sentimental with him, always him \u201cgoing back in time.\u201d One night, he was in Best Buy shopping for himself and saw a mom browsing laptops with her young son. He watched her drift from the priciest computers to the cheapest, and it had him \u201cgoing back in time\u201d to his layaway days. He offered to the buy her the highest-end laptop.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLady, get two or three,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was as if he was Sarge, as if he was dishing out shirts from the trunk of his car. He would commonly save people from having their homes foreclosed \u2014 but \u201conly if it\u2019s people I bump into, I have to feel it.\u201d News of his generosity traveled fast, and people would try scamming him. \u201cI hate to be asked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you DM me, \u2018Hey, I lost my job, can you send me $2,000?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019ll block you.\u201d\n\nIt had to be organic with Shaq, and maybe it was karma, but his good deeds began to boost his portfolio. During the pandemic (when Shaq could never fit into those masks), he was in line behind two hospital nurses at Home Depot and paid for their merchandise as a thank you for their service. Considering he was a DIY kind of guy, he was in Home Depot often, always paying single moms\u2019 bills. Home Depot execs heard about it, and, before long, had him filming \u201cTips from Tool Shaq\u201d commercials.\n\nThere was a backstory behind every deal. He went to Home Depot to buy a Ring security system, which he loved, and then bumped into the Ring CEO at CES. They became partners. It was the same at Rooms to Go, where he\u2019d go buy ginormous beds for himself to make up for those nights on single mattresses. While there, he\u2019d gift other people king- (or Shaq-) sized beds. One day, the Rooms to Go CEO called him to say thank you, to which Shaq said, \u201cI should be thanking you.\u201d Before long, they were putting a Shaq furniture line together, even a luxury chair with built-in speakers. Like his old van.\n\nHome Depot tapped O\u2019Neal for a series of videos on do-it-yourself projects. n/a\n\nWhen Papa John\u2019s founder John Schnatter used the N-word in 2018, putting one of Shaq\u2019s favorite pizza places in jeopardy of folding, the company\u2019s replacement CEO, Steve Ritchie, asked Shaq to be an ambassador. Saying \u201cpizza\u2019s not racist,\u201d Shaq considered it, while also explaining to Richie, \u201cLet me tell you one thing. If you\u2019re looking to hire just a famous Black face to solve your problem, I\u2019m not your guy. But \u2026 I love the brand.\u201d\n\nShaq found out Papa John\u2019s had zero minorities on its board, so he demanded to be the first. He also requested 30 Papa John\u2019s franchises. Some in the Black community called him a sellout, but he was opening doors for more minority franchisees. He was being Sarge again, making a difference.\n\nHe was dipping his size 22 feet into every business imaginable. He started Shaq Fu Internet radio and performed about 50 nights a year as DJ Diesel either at the Wynn or Tomorrowland or Lollapalooza. \u201cOpened him up to a completely different demographic \u2014 one of the smartest things he could do,\u201c said Smeeton, now president of Authentic\u2019s entertainment arm, Authentic Studios.\n\nHe launched a production company, Jersey Legends, which not only shoots his Papa John\u2019s, Icy Hot and JCPenney commercials \u2014 lowering costs \u2014 but produces documentaries and docuseries, including \u201cThe Money Game\u201d on Prime Video and a film project on Allen Iverson. Jersey Legends also produces his prime-time game show on ABC, \u201cLucky 13,\u201d which averages 2.7 million viewers and is a cash cow.\n\nAfter earlier investing in everything from 24 Hour Fitness to Five Guys to Krispy Kreme, Shaq launched Big Chicken restaurants, which will have amassed 80 franchises by the end of this year and is expanding internationally. He does a weekly \u201cBig Podcast with Shaq.\u201d He promoted Klarna by temporarily rebranding himself as Shaquille O\u2019Deal. He\u2019s burst onto the Super Bowl scene seven times with Shaq\u2019s Fun House, a live event featuring artists and celebrities in the city of the Big Game. He even announced he was chief fun officer of Carnival Cruise Line as an ode to Carnival\u2019s former CEO and current Heat owner Micky Arison, for whom Shaq won an NBA title. Shaq is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nWhereas 90% of his deals were once endorsements, Authentic has flipped it to about 50% endorsements and 50% entertainment, media and licensing. But whenever deciding to strike a deal, he won\u2019t let anyone on his team tell him how much it\u2019s worth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be motivated by money.\u201d Instead, he\u2019s motivated by charm.\n\nHe took a meeting with Hershey, for instance, and, \u201cjust messing around,\u201d told them, \u201cI wonder if I can get some Shaq gummies?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the idea,\u201d a Hershey exec said.\n\n\u201cFor real?\u201d Shaq answered.\n\nIt turned out, while living on an Army base in Germany as a young teen with Sarge and Lucille, Shaq had fallen in love with candied gummies. So he asked Hershey to create XL gummies with his face on them, which Smeeton and the team thought was preposterous. But Shaq was adamant, did the taste-testing himself and named them Shaq-A-Licious. They launched in August 2024, doubling Hershey\u2019s projections in a four-month runway. It was so Shaq. He now throws his gummies to the crowd when he DJs.\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s love of gummy candy led to a deal with Hershey\u2019s for a signature version. Getty Images\n\nAs Authentic\u2019s No. 2 shareholder, he had the ear of Salter 24/7, and he went to the CEO in 2021, asking to buy Reebok from Adidas. Shaq was still a Reebok brand ambassador \u2014 even after the \u201cunaffordable\u201d sneaker flap of the \u201990s \u2014 and he felt he had unfinished business. Reebok was no longer in the performance game, but Shaq assured Salter it was \u201ca sleeping giant.\u201d So they closed the deal for $2.5 billion in 2022, with Shaq becoming Reebok\u2019s president of basketball.\n\nHe named Iverson his VP, and off they went, in Shaq\u2019s words, \u201cto just get us back in the game.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t the \u201990s anymore. In an early meeting, he told his Reebok creative team, \u201cHow come I don\u2019t see no high tops?\u201d\n\n\u201cShaq, guys don\u2019t wear high tops anymore,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cBro, make some f****n\u2019 high tops.\u201d\n\nThey drove him to an AAU tournament, where, sure enough, Shaq didn\u2019t see one high top. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to just shut up and listen to the guys that were there every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a micromanager.\u201d\n\nOne of his personal projects instead became finding a signature pro player to wear Reebok, someone to be the new Shaq. So he recruited one of his and Lucille\u2019s favorite players: Angel Reese. \u201cI told her, \u2018I can give you your own shoe. I\u2019m the president of Reebok, there ain\u2019t nobody I gotta talk to, you name your price,\u2019\u201d Shaq said. \u201cThat was my spiel. I knew she was going to like that.\u201d\n\nBut the opportunity that hit home most, that put him in a time warp back to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, was when JCPenney filed for bankruptcy. He convinced Salter and the Authentic board to become part of a consortium to buy it in 2020. The kid who grew up with JCPenney layaway would essentially be in charge of layaway. Shaq-away?\n\nConsidering Authentic is valued at more than $20 billion, and with O\u2019Neal\u2019s Authentic deal said to be half in stock and half in cash, insiders believe O\u2019Neal is now worth close to $1 billion. Everyone who\u2019s dealt with him through the years \u2014 Dale Brown, Armato, the Magic\u2019s Alex Martins \u2014 applauds him. Armato, who helped start it all with Dunk Man, remains a confidant, and Shaq recently reciprocated by connecting Armato with the projected No. 1 overall NBA draft pick in 2026, AJ Dybantsa. Will it be Dunk Man 2.0?\n\nNow 52, Shaq often tells Armato about his life as a businessman, how he travels to Poland, China and Australia. How he\u2019s on podcasts and broadcasts. How he\u2019s making a Netflix documentary about reviving Reebok. So Armato asked Shaq to do him a favor: Go see his brother John, a top doctor in Los Angeles. Just for an annual checkup.\n\nSo he can live forever.\n\n-------------------\n\nShaq\u2019s portfolio of endorsements and investments",

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "You probably don't spend much time thinking about appliance energy efficiency standards -- and that's by design.\n\nThese mostly-invisible regulations ensure that every appliance you find at Home Depot, for example, meets minimum standards to save you energy, and therefore money.\n\n\"The standards raise the floor,\" said Andrew deLaski, executive director at Appliance Standards Awareness Project. In other words: Even if you can only afford the most basic, inexpensive appliance, it's still going to be energy efficient to some degree.\n\nBut these standards are at risk of being weakened or stalled under the second Trump administration. \"We can expect the president...to do what he can to undermine efficiency standards,\" said Jenny Carter, assistant professor at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law and Graduate School.\n\nHere's your guide to the politics of energy efficiency standards -- and what it means the next time you go to upgrade an appliance.\n\nWhat are appliance efficiency standards?\n\nThe federal government's Department of Energy is required by law to set and periodically revise energy efficiency standards for all types of appliances.\n\nEverything from light fixtures to refrigerators, air conditioners to furnaces are subject to these rules. The standard for each category of product sets a minimum level of energy efficiency for any model sold in the US (including domestic and imported items).\n\nDon't get it mixed up with the Energy Star program: That's designed to distinguish the better-performing products in the market, which go above and beyond the minimum federal standards.\n\nWhy do appliance efficiency standards matter?\n\nThese standards have been around since the 1970s, and they've been quietly saving American customers energy and money all along, deLaski said.\n\nBecause the standards are mandatory for all appliances sold in the US, customers don't need to buy a premium product to get some level of energy efficiency. The federal rules ensure that all manufacturers incorporate energy efficiency measures into all products.\n\nThis lowers energy use, which is not only good for reducing environmental pollution but also for helping electrical grids that are contending with rapidly increasing power demand.\n\nOf course, it also saves Americans money on their utility bills. A report that deLaski's organization completed in 2017 showed that the average household saved $500 annually due to these standards.\n\nHow appliance energy standards changed under Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration inherited a large backlog of work.\n\nDuring President Trump's first term, the Department of Energy failed to review and update efficiency standards on more than 20 categories that were up for review. The DOE spent the last four years catching up on the missed deadlines and addressing new ones that cycle in every six years.\n\nA study by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project showed that efficiency standards set by the Biden administration generated $107 in annual utility bills savings for the average household. On top of that, deLaski said American businesses are estimated to save $2 billion collectively due to Biden-era efficiency standards on commercial and industrial appliances.\n\nLED light bulbs are a lot more efficient than incandescent or compact fluorescent bulbs. Alina Bradford / CNET\n\nTrump's executive order targets energy efficiency standards\n\nOne of President Trump's first executive orders hints at a clash with appliance efficiency standards. The president's executive order on \"Unleashing American Energy\" said it was the government's policy to \"to safeguard the American people's freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances,\" explicitly naming items like light bulbs and showerheads. The president has personally expressed his disdain for the effect of low-flow showerheads on his hair.\n\nIf history is any indication, Trump could once again direct the DOE to ignore required deadlines for updating existing standards, as he did during his first term. He could also allow several pending updates from the Biden administration to simply languish, deLaski said.\n\nAny other attempts to undermine efficiency standards will be difficult for Trump to pull off. The law governing efficiency standards has a so-called \"anti-backsliding\" provision, which means no new appliance standard can be weaker than a previous standard. \"There's no going backwards,\" deLaski said.\n\nIt might be an uphill battle for Trump to eliminate appliance standards altogether, an idea included in the conservative Project 2025 policy playbook. Project 2025 is widely seen as a blueprint for Trump, even as he has tried to distance himself from the document.\n\nBut the efficiency laws are governed by Congress, meaning both the House and the Senate would need to vote to repeal those laws. \"It's a scary thought,\" Carter said. \"The good news is, it will be difficult and unpopular with the public.\"\n\nGenerally, appliance manufacturers themselves are not the ones calling to repeal or weaken efficiency standards. \"These attempts at rollbacks are primarily driven by anti-regulation advocacy organizations,\" deLaski said.\n\nHow to shop for an energy efficient appliance\n\nDespite all the swirling political uncertainty, not much will change next time you go to buy an appliance. Efficiency standards are mostly an invisible part of the marketplace, and every product for sale meets the minimum requirements.\n\nIf you're especially keen on maximizing efficiency, you can look for that Energy Star label, which denotes appliances that go beyond the baseline standards.\n\nAnd even if the Trump administration did manage to weaken or eliminate certain standards, that wouldn't mean manufactures suddenly stop making efficient appliances. Many states have their own efficiency standards and, besides, efficient appliances are often just the best, most appealing appliances to customers on the basis of performance.",

            "content": "Staining your hardwood floors is a great way to get an updated look for far less than it costs to replace them. The process starts by removing existing stain from wood with a chemical stripper. Then, you'll need to thoroughly sand the floors before carefully and evenly applying the stain. Finally, to protect your floors, it's a good idea to finish up by applying a coat of clear polyurethane. There are several things that can go wrong, from blotchy applications to failing to consider how a stain will react with your particular wood. But whether you want to achieve a sun-kissed whitewash look or embrace a bold and dark espresso finish, there are eight floor stain color trends you should consider in 2025.\n\nYou'll find a variety of liquid, oil, and gel-based floor stains on the shelves at your local home improvement store. Many DIYers are switching from water-based to gel-based wood stains because they are more user-friendly and forgiving, but each type of floor stain has pros and cons. To achieve deeper penetration and more vibrant hues, like the walnut, teak, and espresso colors on our list, we recommend using an oil-based stain. But to avoid yellowing on lighter-colored floors, like driftwood beige and soft gray, you should stick to water-based stains that are designed to be colorfast and oxidize less over time. No matter which color you choose, don't forget to do a swatch test in an inconspicuous area to understand how the stain will look on your floors.",

The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US.

            "content": "The real estate sector has been dragged down by high interest rates over the past few years. Higher rates have affected many companies in many industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by a slow real estate market, including home improvement companies like Home Depot (HD -4.19%).\n\nSome companies are already feeling some positive impacts from the interest rate cuts the Federal Reserve imposed in September, and some stocks have gotten love from investors who are feeling confident about rebounding businesses and further rate cuts.\n\nHome Depot has a long track record of excellence, and it pays an attractive dividend. That has kept investors happy despite pressure on its business, and Home Depot stock is up 14% over the past year. Let's see how things might play out over the next 12 months.\n\nManaging through tough times\n\nAs the largest home improvement chain in the world, with 2,300 stores in North America, Home Depot is susceptible to changing real estate trends. Although it's typically reliable for steady growth and high profitability, it has struggled with high mortgage rates, which have trickled down to fewer homes on the market, fewer home sales, and less spending on home improvement.\n\nHome Depot's comparable sales (comps) were down 1.3% in the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 27), and earnings per share declined to $3.67 from $3.81 the previous year. However, there was a lot of strength in the quarter. Total revenue increased 6.6% year over year, comps were positive in some regions, and digital sales increased 4%.\n\nThe quarter was better than expected, and management raised its full-year outlook for revenue from a 2.5% to 2.5% increase to a 4% increase, comps from a 3% to 4% decline to a 2.5% decline, and EPS adjusted for 53 weeks from a 1% to 3% decline to a 1% decline. It reports fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 19.\n\nIf those trends continue, comps and EPS could be back on the rise in 2025.\n\nInvesting in new opportunities\n\nManagement has taken several steps to improve its e-commerce distribution network and expand its opportunities despite the challenging operating environment. It has made several acquisitions over the past few years that provide it with new revenue streams and a wider audience, as well as broaden its product assortment. Last year, it acquired specialty home improvement company SRS Distribution for $18 billion, and it says this expands its addressable market by $50 billion.\n\nHome Depot has been upgrading its delivery network for faster shipments and a higher same-day delivery rate, and it discovered that customers weren't aware of all the delivery options. It updated the website to better reflect all the options and launched a marketing campaign to communicate the enhanced services, and it has seen an uptick in engagement and higher conversions.\n\nFollow the interest rates\n\nHow Home Depot performs over the next year will at least partially, if not largely, depend on what happens with interest rates, mortgage rates, and the real estate market. There were initial signs of improvement in the sector when interest rates first came down, but trends have been up and down since then.\n\nThere are only so many things Home Depot can do to stay strong in the face of external headwinds, and it might continue to ride out this phase until the landscape is more favorable. The actions that management has implemented to upgrade digital services and widen its customer base should lead to some improvement that could offset continued pressure if it remains.\n\nA year from now, Home Depot could be reporting comps growth and higher profits, but even if it doesn't manage those feats in 2025, the market could continue to reward its stock if it beats expectations. I wouldn't expect high gains in 2025, but the best-case scenario is that the business rebounds and Home Depot stock beats the market. In any event, investors can expect an increase in its excellent dividend.",

Today we are looking at Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and the best and worst performers in the home furnishing and improvement retail industry.\n\nHome furnishing and improvement retailers understand that \u2018home is where the heart is\u2019 but that a home is only right when it\u2019s in livable condition and furnished just right. These stores therefore focus on providing what is needed for both the upkeep of a house as well as what is desired for the aesthetics of a home. Decades ago, it was thought that furniture and home improvement would resist e-commerce because of the logistical challenges of shipping a sofa or lawn mower, but now you can buy both online; so just like other retailers, these stores need to adapt to new realities and consumer behaviors.\n\nThe 7 home furnishing and improvement retail stocks we track reported a slower Q3. As a group, revenues missed analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 8.9% below.\n\nLuckily, home furnishing and improvement retail stocks have performed well with share prices up 19% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD)\n\nFounded and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that sells everything from tools to building materials to appliances.\n\nHome Depot reported revenues of $40.22 billion, up 6.6% year on year.

Overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with a decent beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates but a slight miss of analysts\u2019 gross margin estimates.\n\n\"While macroeconomic uncertainty remains, our third quarter performance exceeded our expectations,\" said Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO.\n\nHome Depot Total Revenue\n\nHome Depot pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group.

Unfortunately, The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card doesn\u2019t elicit the same good vibes, despite its $0 annual fee.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThat\u2019s because the store-branded card doesn't earn ongoing rewards and offers little in the way of perks. Even the most loyal Home Depot fan would probably be better off with a flat-rate cash-back or rewards card.\n\nHere are five things to know about The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card:\n\n1. It offers deferred interest\n\nThe Home Depot Consumer Credit Card can help you finance a big home project; in fact, that's its primary selling point. It offers deferred interest on purchases of $299 or more.\n\nBe aware, however, that there's a difference between deferred interest and a true 0% intro APR offer. With the former, interest is accruing in the background during the introductory period. With the latter, the interest rate during the intro period is literally 0% \u2014 no interest is accruing at all. This makes a big difference it you get to the end of the intro period and you haven't paid off the balance completely.\n\nWith The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card, if you fail to pay off the balance completely by the time the deferred interest period ends, you\u2019ll be charged all the interest that was adding up from the day you made the purchase. That could end up being an expensive oversight. By contrast, with a 0% offer, you will pay interest only on the remaining balance and only going forward.\n\nIf you can qualify for a card with a true 0% introductory APR offer that lasts 12 months or longer, you\u2019d be better off. The BankAmericard\u00ae credit card is a great alternative. You get 0% Intro APR for 18 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. After the Intro APR offer ends, a Variable APR that\u2019s currently 15.24%-25.24% will apply\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

It offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and Balance Transfers for 15 months, and then the ongoing APR of 19.49%-28.24% Variable APR. Plus, you'll earn at least 1.5% cash back on every purchase with the card.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. You won't want to carry a balance\n\nEven if you don't take advantage of the deferred interest offer, you'll want to avoid carrying a balance from month to month. As with many store-branded credit cards, the ongoing interest rate can be quite high. The ongoing APR is 29.99%, Variable APR.\n\n3. Cardholders enjoy a longer return period and exclusive offers\n\nFrequent Home Depot shoppers might benefit from the fact that hassle-free returns are offered for one year with the card, which is four times longer than you'd normally get on Home Depot purchases. That could come in handy, especially on large purchases that you end up regretting later.\n\nDuring special promotions, cardholders can also qualify for up to 24-month financing.\n\n4. Home Depot offers a separate card for bigger projects\n\nHome Depot also offers the Home Depot Project Loan Card, which allows cardholders to borrow up to $55,000 for big improvement projects. As of August 2023, you might be able to qualify for a loan as low as 7.42%, but your actual terms will vary.\n\nIt's designed to finance major projects such as kitchen or bathroom remodels and could appeal to consumers who don't have access to lower-APR loans elsewhere, such as a home equity loan.\n\n5. Loyalty doesn't always pay off\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nHardcore Home Depot fans could benefit from The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card's financing offers. But without ongoing rewards, you can do better.\n\nFor example, if you're a do-it-yourselfer and you're not loyal to Home Depot, the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off eligible store purchases, earning it a place among NerdWallet's best store credit cards. For purchases of $299 and up, you can choose either the 5% discount or a similar deferred interest offer.",

            "content": "Commanding a market cap of $408.8 billion, The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) is a leading American home improvement retailer specializing in a wide range of products for construction, home renovation, appliances, and services. Founded in 1978 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, it operates more than 2,300 stores across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nHD shares have trailed the broader market considerably over the past year. HD has gained 16.5% over this time frame, while the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied 22.6%. However, in 2025, shares of HD surged 6.4%, surpassing SPX\u2019s 3.1% rally on a YTD basis.\n\nNarrowing the focus, HD has also underperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY). The exchange-traded fund has climbed about 31.1% over the past year.\n\nHome Depot has lagged behind the broader market over the past year due to a slowdown in the housing market, reduced consumer spending on big-ticket items, increased competition, and the impact of higher interest rates. Additionally, supply chain and cost challenges have weighed on its performance.\n\nHowever, shares of Home Depot rose 3.3% on Jan. 15, following news that the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December came in lower than expected. The broader market rally was driven by the positive economic implications of falling inflation, with Home Depot seen as a potential significant beneficiary.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, which ended in Jan. 2025, analysts expect HD\u2019s EPS to grow marginally to $15.12 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 36 analysts covering HD stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 26 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d eight \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 25 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 14, Stifel Financial Corp. (SF) raised its price target on Home Depot to $405 from $400, maintaining a \u201cHold\u201d rating.\n\nThe mean price target of $434.44 represents a 5% premium to HD\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $500 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 20.8%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Republic Merchandising Inc., which manages Biggie Smalls\u2019 merchandise, has also joined the suit.\n\nAccording to the filing, the image was captured just days before Biggie was slain in Los Angeles on March 7th, 1997.

            "content": "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nThe recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.\n\nFound at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model. Manufactured in Mexico and Korea by LG Electronics Inc. of Korea, the ranges were imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nModel and serial numbers involved in the recall can be found here.\n\nOwners of the recalled ranges should contact LG for a free warning label and placement instructions. The label reminds consumers to use the lock out/control lock function on the range panel to disable activation of the heating elements when not in use.\n\n\"Keep children and pets away\"\n\n\"Consumers are cautioned to keep children and pets away from the knobs, to check the range knobs to ensure they are off before leaving home or going to bed, and not to leave objects on the range when the range is not in use,\" the recall notice stated.\n\nLG Electronics can be reached at 800-399-3265 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST Monday through Friday, or by email at lgrange.recall@lge.com, or at https://lgecares.com/rangerecall.\n\nThe issue seemingly extends beyond one brand, as evidenced by Samsung's summertime recall of more than 1.1 million ranges sold nationwide after about 250 fires injured dozens and killed at least seven pets.\n\nAccording to the agency, CPSC was \"aware of incidents where houses burned, and people died from house fires started by range knobs accidentally turned on whether from people bumping into the knobs or pets activating the range. The issues affect both gas and electric ranges,\" the federal agency stated in a summary of a June 27 working group meeting.\n\nBetween 2018 and May 30, 2024, CPSC data shows there were 338 incidents involving a range or cooktop accidentally being activated, involving 10 manufacturers. Two of those incidents led to fatalities, while 31 resulted in nonfatal injuries, according to the agency.\n\n\"Additionally, CPSC staff have found two other fatal incidents where a range was accidentally turned on when a knob was bumped, but the manufacturer is unknown.\"\n\nA video taken in 2024 appeared to illustrate the risks, with home security footage showing a dog jumping toward a stove briefly and turning on the burner, with its flames igniting a nearby cardboard box. The Colorado Springs, Colorado, homeowner was treated for smoke inhalation, and the June 26 fire temporarily displaced his family, CBS affiliate KKTV reported.",

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "The estate of legendary rapper Notorious B.I.G. is suing Target, Home Depot and others over allegations that they sold unauthorized canvas prints of the famed \u201cKing of New York\u201d photo that was snapped just days before his death.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court, Notorious BIG LLC claims the retailers sold prints illegally created by iCanvas \u2013 a small firm that the estate says showed a \u201ccomplete disregard for celebrities\u2019 personality rights, lack of respect for artists\u2019 efforts, and disdain for intellectual property law.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendants specifically chose to use Mr. Wallace\u2019s persona, name, image, likeness \u2026 in an attempt to capitalize on their fame and extraordinary financial value,\u201d Biggie\u2019s estate writes, referring to his legal name, Christopher George Latore Wallace.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe image at issue in the new lawsuit is \u201cThe King Of New York\u201d \u2013 a portrait of Biggie wearing a gold crown in front of a red backdrop, snapped in March 1997 only three days before the rapper was killed in a Los Angeles shooting.\n\nThe photos \u2014 taken by photographer Barron Claiborne, who is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are some of the most well-known images of the late rapper. One is featured in a huge mural in his Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and the plastic crown featured in the image sold at auction in 2020 for a whopping $594,750.\n\nIn their Tuesday lawsuit, the estate and Claiborne say that iCanvas sold canvas prints of the images for more than eight years without permission. In addition to selling them directly, the lawsuit claims the prints were also sold by Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Nordstrom and Target \u2013 each of which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nWhen contacted about the problem in 2023, Home Depot, Nordstrom and Target removed the offending products, the lawsuit says, but iCanvas and Bed Bath & Beyond allegedly continue to sell them.\n\nThe case claims that the sale of the images not only infringed Claiborne\u2019s copyrights to the King images, but also breached federal trademark law and violated the rapper\u2019s likeness rights.\n\n\u201cMr. Wallace\u2019s fan base has continued to expand since his passing,\u201d the estate\u2019s lawyers write. \u201cMr. Wallace\u2019s persona, name, image, likeness, and artistic works are so well known that they are almost universally and instantly recognizable, even by those born after he died.\u201d\n\nThe case could portend bigger problems for iCanvas. The lawyers for Biggie\u2019s estate say they\u2019re only a few of the \u201cvictims\u201d of a \u201cmulti-year unlawful campaign\u201d by the company to sell unauthorized prints of famous people and images, including musicians Beyonce, Prince, Jay-Z, Snoop Dog and LL Cool J.\n\nNone of the defendants immediately returned requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Notorious B.I.G. estate has sued over photographs. In 2019, the estate sued hip-hop photographer Chi Modu over his famed 1996 image of Biggie standing in front of the World Trade Center. Though Modu owns the copyrights to the image, the estate claimed he was violating the rapper\u2019s likeness rights by using it on merchandise.\n\nThat case settled last year on undisclosed terms \u2013 a deal that came with a warning from the estate\u2019s attorneys about the use of his image: \u201cPictures of Christopher cannot be commercially exploited without a license from our client.\u201d",

            "content": "Home Depot (HD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this home-improvement retailer have returned +7.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, which Home Depot falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nHome Depot is expected to post earnings of $3.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $15.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.1%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.61 indicates a change of +3.3% from what Home Depot is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Home Depot.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Home Depot, the consensus sales estimate of $38.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.5%. The $158.61 billion and $163.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.9% and +3.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nHome Depot reported revenues of $40.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3.78 for the same period compares with $3.81 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.17%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nHome Depot is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Home Depot. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy and hold.\n\nIn recent years, many investors have shifted their focus from dividend-paying stocks to high-growth secular-themed stocks that typically don\u2019t offer dividends. However, history shows that investors shouldn\u2019t overlook dividends. According to estimates by AGF Investments, the long-term case for dividend-paying equities is strong: if a dollar was invested in the broader market Index in 1927 without reinvesting dividends, it would be worth $243 today. In contrast, that same dollar with dividends reinvested would be worth $3,737.\n\nBecause of this earnings and income potential, income investors often turn to dividend stocks when the market shifts. While these stocks may not be keeping pace with the broader market, analysts remain optimistic about their future prospects. A report from J.P. Morgan indicated that global equities are approaching a notable period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a long-term increase in dividend momentum. Over the past 20 years, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts predict this growth will accelerate to 7.6%. The main factor driving this increased growth is the low starting point of payout ratios (dividends as a proportion of earnings). During the Covid pandemic in 2020, many companies cut their dividends, leading to a 12% drop in global dividends, which was a steeper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This was a rational response to an uncertain environment with unpredictable effects and duration.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds\n\nHowever, equity markets rebounded strongly as global earnings soared, primarily driven by Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Since dividends are typically determined by conservative boards and management, they tend to lag behind earnings during significant earnings surges. As a result, dividend payout ratios are now near their lowest levels in 25 years, meaning companies are paying out less compared to historical averages. Simply returning to a more typical payout level could contribute an additional 2% annual growth over the next five years. This isn\u2019t just a theoretical scenario\u2014global dividend growth has already started to exceed earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters, as reported by J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhile recent market gains have largely been driven by a small group of non-dividend-paying companies, this is starting to shift. In 2024, many big tech companies initiated their dividend policies, highlighting the importance of returning capital to shareholders and positioning dividends as a complement to share buybacks. The report highlighted that although the dividend yields from these tech giants are initially modest, the total amount they are committing to dividends is significant\u2014$17 billion collectively over the next year. More importantly, these actions send a strong signal to the market.\n\nIncome-focused investors have increasingly turned their attention to dividend income, making it a more prominent part of personal earnings. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that dividend income has risen from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, demonstrating its growing importance as an income source. The report further highlighted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for over a third of total equity returns, with the rest coming from capital gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned through various credible sources, including Business Insider, Forbes, Morningstar, and Barron\u2019s, and identified their consensus picks from their recent articles. Next, we sorted these companies based on the number of hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database that owned stakes in these companies, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based home improvement company that is engaged in the sale of building materials and home improvement products. The company has over 2,300 stores in the US, Canada, and Mexico. The home improvement industry is large and fragmented, with an estimated annual value of $1 trillion. Although The Home Depot is the sector\u2019s largest player, it commands only a 15% market share. This creates substantial growth opportunities, as the company has the potential to gain a larger share from smaller competitors who struggle to match its strong brand, vast inventory, and smooth omnichannel experience.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) maintained a strong financial position in fiscal year 2024, generating over $15 billion in operating cash flow during the first nine months. This robust cash flow highlights the company\u2019s capacity to maintain its reputation as a reliable dividend payer. The company has increased its dividend payouts for 14 consecutive years, making it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.19%, as of February 4.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about HD in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cWhile Home Depot, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company\u2019s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.\u201d\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 82 funds held stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of roughly $7.6 billion. With over 9.4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 3rd on our list of best dividend stocks to buy and hold. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Given its proximity to many consumers, you've most likely shopped at a Costco (COST -3.93%) or Home Depot (HD -4.19%) warehouse. With combined annual revenue in the hundreds of billions of dollars, these businesses are two gigantic retailers.\n\nDue to their dominant positions, Costco and Home Depot might be on your investing radar. Of the two, what is the top retail stock to buy right now?\n\nTaking Costco for granted\n\nCostco continues to hum along, supporting a long-running track record of steady growth. Revenue and diluted earnings per share climbed at compound annual rates of 10.8% and 14.9%, respectively, between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024. The top and bottom lines were up in the fiscal 2025 first quarter as well (ended Nov. 24). Consumers will always need the high-quality merchandise Costco sells, which means the business experiences durable growth.\n\nBy requiring consumers to pay for an annual membership to shop at Costco locations, the company is able to drive customer loyalty and repeat purchase behavior. With a 92.8% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada and membership account growth of 7.6% in Q1, memberships are very popular.\n\nIt's difficult to see Costco being disrupted anytime soon. It has a tremendous scale advantage that allows it to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers that lead to everyday low prices for consumers. Even in the face of Amazon Prime's e-commerce success, Costco's financials keep improving.\n\nCostco seems to perform well, no matter what is happening with the broader economic backdrop. Members, revenue, and earnings march higher over time, with investors benefiting from share-price appreciation and dividends. With minimal hiccups, it's easy to take Costco for granted.\n\nZoom out with Home Depot\n\nWith trailing-12-month revenue of $155 billion and 2,345 stores in total, Home Depot is the clear leader in the home improvement industry. However, despite this first-place position, which puts it well ahead of Lowe's, the business is dealing with a notable slowdown in demand.\n\nManagement expects same-store sales (SSS) to decline 2.5% in fiscal 2024, which ends around the time of this writing (Jan. 28). This would be the second straight year Home Depot reports a dip for this key metric. That's a far cry from the consistent annual gains registered in the years before fiscal 2023.\n\nHome Depot benefits when interest rates are low and inflationary pressures aren't a concern. This is precisely what macro conditions looked like during the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also helped that households were flush with cash.\n\nBut we're in a different reality today. Consumers are hesitant to spend on big discretionary purchases, a category that expensive home renovations might fall under.\n\nAll isn't lost, though. The home improvement industry is large and fragmented, giving Home Depot a durable growth runway. Homes in the U.S. are only getting older, leading to more need for upgrades. And households have lots of untapped equity they can use.\n\nInvestors can also appreciate management's favorable capital allocation policies. The business has historically returned massive amounts of cash to shareholders with dividends and buybacks. That's the sign of a financially sound enterprise.\n\nDoes valuation matter to you?\n\nIn my opinion, Costco is the better business, primarily because it has proven to be less cyclical than Home Depot. It's also anyone's guess when the latter can return to SSS growth, something the former has no issues with.\n\nBut at a price-to-earnings ratio of 56.7, Costco shares are too rich. Home Depot's valuation multiple is 50% cheaper than Costco's. While I'd like to own Costco if the price is right, it currently looks like a terrible investment opportunity. Therefore, of these two retail juggernauts. Home Depot is the better buy today.",

Well, Home Depot apparently doesn't.\n\nWhile shopping at a Home Depot location in Casselberry, Florida, a Redditor captured a photo of the bulbs for sale.\n\nPhoto Credit: Reddit\n\nElephant ear stands out for its large heart-shaped leaves attached to tubers. While edible when cooked, it isn't worth planting unless you want to choke out your native vegetation. Elephant ear can grow up to 9 feet tall and 6 feet long. Thanks to rhizomes that extend from bulbs, it can spread quickly. If you want a similar-looking plant that's noninvasive, consider the broadleaf arrowhead (duck potato) instead.\n\nBe careful when attempting manual removal. You can dig up the bulblike tubers, but remember that the leaves contain oxalic acid that can irritate the skin, so wear gloves. It may take several inches of digging to reach all the tubers. Any little bit left behind can quickly propagate more of the invasive plant.\n\nAfterward, you can replace the soil and begin rewilding the area. As you find native plants, particularly deep-rooted ground cover such as wild ginger or cloves, you can help smooth out more potential invasion.\n\nUnfortunately, finding invasive plants at big-box stores isn't an anomaly. In 2015, a petition went around for Home Depot to stop selling invasive plants. If you ever see kudzu, Japanese knotweed, water hyacinth, or paper mulberry in a store, don't buy it.\n\nDo your due diligence and check online resources such as extensions at local universities or the Xerces Society to see if a plant that you're interested in is invasive before buying it from a big-box store. You can also go to native nurseries.\n\nOne commenter stated: \"Box stores sell countless invasive plants. Mexican Petunias and bamboo are awful too.\"\n\nSomeone else noted: \"I think the best thing [to] do now is educate people not to buy and plant them. If people don't buy them, Home Depot won't stock them.\"\n\nAt least humor wasn't lost.\n\nSomeone quipped, \"I prefer the cinnamon sugar kind.\" Another person said, \"I prefer bear claws to elephant ears.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Home Depot (HD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this home-improvement retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.35%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Home Depot was expected to post earnings of $3.64 per share, but it reported $3.78 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.54 per share, while it actually produced $4.67 per share, a surprise of 2.86%.\n\nFor Home Depot, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nHome Depot currently has an Earnings ESP of +23.07%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 25, 2025.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it\u2019s crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nREAD ALSO: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nSince then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.\n\nInvestors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it\u2019s not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American home improvement company that is engaged in the sale of building materials and home improvement products. The company boasts over 2,300 stores in the US, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe US housing market has faced challenges in recent years due to rising interest rates, higher mortgage costs, and inflationary pressures affecting consumers. However, a recent decline in interest rates is expected to offer some relief. On January 15, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) saw its stock climb 3.38% following a lower-than-expected core Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December. As inflation continues to ease, the broader economy stands to benefit, with Home Depot likely to see positive effects as well.\n\nThe home improvement industry is vast and highly fragmented, with an estimated annual value of $1 trillion. While The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is the largest company in the sector, it holds only a 15% market share. This leaves significant room for growth, as the company has the potential to capture a larger share from smaller competitors that struggle to compete with its strong brand presence, extensive inventory, and seamless omnichannel capabilities.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) maintained a solid financial position in fiscal year 2024, generating more than $15 billion in operating cash flow during the first nine months. This strong cash flow reinforces the company\u2019s ability to uphold its reputation as a dependable dividend payer. The company has consistently raised its dividend payouts for 14 consecutive years, which makes it one of the most promising stocks that pay dividends. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.18%, as of January 30.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 82 funds held stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of roughly $7.6 billion.\n\nOverall HD ranks 7th on our list of the most promising dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In 2023, his debut museum exhibition \u201cPainter\u2019s Refuge: A Way of Life\u201d at the Harvey B. Gantt Center for African American Arts and Culture in North Carolina brought together works that transformed utilitarian materials, including army tents, into physically striking visions informed by the Bible, Abstract Expressionism, and Art Povera.\n\nThe best of Artnet News in your inbox.

You have successfully subscribed to Artnet News.\n\nRight now, the artist\u2019s most recent works are on view at New York\u2019s Canada Gallery, in \u201cBeyond the Frame: Abstraction Reconstructed,\u201d a two-artist show alongside the work of late American artist Denzil Hurley. Here, Sylvester debuts his large-scale \u201cOffering\u201d series, works made with rubber, a commonplace industrial material with an exploitative and tragic colonial history.\n\nDuring the 19th century, in the Congo, rubber was forcibly harvested through slave labor under the rule of Belgium\u2019s King Leopold III, resulting in catastrophic mass suffering, and death, while stripping the country of its natural resources. In his new compositions, Sylvester translates this fraught, though ubiquitous material into a powerful artistic medium, creating nearly monochromatic paintings that possess an intensity of meaning.\n\nFor this Source Material, Sylvester takes us behind the scenes, on trips to Home Depot and through the streets of Ridgewood, Queens, as he experiments with rubber\u2014while confronting its fraught history.\n\nThis collection of images captures the evolution of my recent work with EPDM rubber, reflecting both the material\u2019s industrial past and its transformation within the intimate space of my studio. EPDM rubber, which stands for ethylene-propylene-diene monomer, is commonly used in nuclear reactors as a sealing material due to its excellent radiation resistance, high-temperature stability, and chemical resistance; it is also a valuable component in nuclear power plants.\n\nWhat began as a straightforward purchase from local suppliers like Home Depot became a more complex journey when the pandemic disrupted supply chains, making it difficult to source material and forcing me to seek rubber elsewhere, primarily from specialized roofing companies. This shift, while born out of necessity, allowed me to engage with the material in a more deliberate way, adapting it to the unique demands of my practice.\n\nThe rubber, in its original form, holds the imprint of its industrial history\u2014sturdy, functional, and utilitarian. But through my process, it is transformed. Whether it\u2019s stretched across a substrate or used as a floor mat to catch acrylic waste, I find new life for the material, creating surfaces that reflect both the labor and the excess embedded in its origins. The rubber scraps, once discarded, take on new significance, shifting from waste to a tool for creation.\n\nAs you can see in the below images, there is a dialogue between the interior of my studio in Ridgewood, New York, and the exterior landscape, as I often find inspiration for my work by capturing images of the environment outside. These natural forms and textures inform the surfaces I build inside, creating a visual and conceptual bridge between the two. In this way, the studio is not an isolated space, but one that connects to the world beyond, bringing its terrain and rhythms into my creative process.\n\nIn working with rubber, I feel I am both confronting and reclaiming its violent, industrious past\u2014 particularly the transgressions enacted across Congo in the 1800s in its farming and production. I am speaking to its history through the surfaces I craft, while also connecting to my own ancestral ties to working with the discarded and the repurposed. The act of transforming these materials becomes a statement on resilience, sustainability, and the complex relationship between industry, environment, and personal history. Each surface tells a story of both destruction and renewal, a reminder of the power of reclamation and the potential embedded in what others might overlook.\n\nWelcome to Source Material, where artists share their creative journeys beyond the confines of the studio. From hunting down frescos in Florence to chasing storms in Cornwall, we explore the eclectic sources of inspiration that fuel artists\u2019 imaginations.",

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Catch up on the Oxygen app.\n\n\u201cI just came home, my wife is dead,\u201d Jonathan Crupi, 30 at the time, said in the recorded call. \u201cOh my God.

She\u2019d been pushed down a flight of stairs and stabbed 15 times, NBC 4 New York reported.\n\n\u201cIt was violent. It was a violent death,\u201d said Michael Cosenza, a detective with the New York City Police Department's homicide squad that was investigating the case.\n\nThe residence, located in the New Springville neighborhood of Staten Island, had been ransacked.\n\n\u201cIt was completely trashed,\u201d Cosenza said in the \u201cDeadly Lesson\u201d episode of New York Homicide, airing Saturdays at 9/8c p.m. on Oxygen. \u201cTo me, it looked staged.\u201d\n\nInvestigators found no sign of forced entry, but a rear sliding glass door was ajar. The handle was processed for DNA as detectives dug in to try to catch the brutal killer.\n\nSimeonette Mapes-Crupi. Photo: Oxygen\n\nWho was Simeonette Mapes-Crupi? A beloved daughter and sister, Mapes-Crupi had an infectious laugh and adored dancing. \u201cShe loved life. She loved to have fun,\u201d her father, John Mapes Jr., told New York Homicide. Mapes-Crupi, like her husband, taught at the School for Classics, a high school in Brooklyn. They had both worked on getting a master\u2019s degree at the College of Staten Island in order to advance their careers. They were just two days away from their fifth wedding anniversary at the time of Mapes-Crupi's murder, NBC 4 New York reported.\n\nRELATED: Where to Watch All Episodes of New York Homicide, As Oxygen True Crime Show Returns for Season 3\n\nInvestigators look at Jonathan Crupi\n\n\u201cIn domestic situations, the spouse is the first person that\u2019s looked at,\u201d said Assistant District Attorney Wanda DeOliveira, of the Richmond County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nCrupi gave police a detailed account of his movements before he called 911. He said that after leaving home at 7:30 a.m. the morning his wife was killed, he had his car inspected, went to the school he worked at to pick up supplies, shopped for sneakers, and, finally, went to Home Depot.\n\nCrupi had mentioned a robbery when he called 911. But investigators doubted that claim. \u201cCredit cards, blank checks were out on the counter,\u201d DeOliveira told New York Homicide. \u201cAn engagement ring in the bathroom was still sitting there.\u201d\n\nJonathan Crupi.

A receipt showed that Crupi\u2019s car had been inspected, and noted the mileage at the time of the check-up.\n\nCrupi had said that he\u2019d gone to Home Depot in the Charleston area of Staten Island. But a review of security cameras showed that Crupi had never arrived there.\n\n\u201cHis story wasn\u2019t adding up,\u201d said Burdick. \u201cWhy do I have the husband of a homicide victim lying?\u201d\n\nRELATED: Where Is P. Diddy Now?

As investigators sought to identify the mystery woman, Mapes-Crupi was laid to rest. \u201cThere were several hundreds of people that were there,\u201d said her father, Mapes Jr.\n\nIt was during this somber occasion that family members learned that Mapes-Crupi had developed a program for students who couldn't afford to go to prom.\n\n\u201cShe wasn't looking for recognition, and that's the epitome of what a good person should be,\u201d said her brother, John Mapes III.\n\nSimeonette Mapes-Crupi and Jonathan Crupi. Photo: Oxygen\n\nInvestigators dig deeper into Simeonette Mapes-Crupi\u2019s marriage\n\nOn July 11, detectives learned that Mapes-Crupi \u201chad begged\u201d the School for Classics to hire her husband, said DeOliveira.\n\nThey also discovered that Crupi\u2019s claim that he\u2019d gone to school to pick up supplies that his wife needed to teach summer school didn\u2019t square. According to the school's principal, all the necessary materials had already been moved over to another site where summer school would be taught.\n\nSchool security footage showed Crupi entering a computer room. In August, investigators subpoenaed Crupi\u2019s and Mapes-Crupi\u2019s school-issued laptops. Detectives found their recent search histories to be revealing.\n\nCrupi had searched about reselling sneakers and hip-hop music. She had searched about in vitro fertilization and marriage counselors.\n\nOne of Mapes-Crupi\u2019s Google searches stood out. It was for a phone number matching one that was saved in her cell phone contacts simply as \u201cWoman.\u201d\n\nRELATED: JonBenet Ramsey\u2019s Dad Shares New Update After Meeting with Boulder P.D.: \"I Think...\"\n\nSex worker becomes key witness\n\nDetectives determined that the phone number belonged to a sex worker known as \"Miss Pumpkin.\" They interviewed her on August 15.\n\n\u201cWe showed her a photograph of Jonathan Crupi. She knew him as Mike,\u201d said Cosenza, adding that Miss Pumpkin said she\u2019d had sexual encounters with him for two years.\n\nThe escort told police that on July 5, the day of the murder, Crupi called to arrange an encounter at 12:45 p.m., the time that Crupi had told authorities that he'd gone to Home Depot.\n\nMiss Pumpkin agreed to a DNA swab. Hers matched the evidence found on the door at the couple's home.\n\nMapes-Crupi\u2019s phone contact list and computer searches convinced detectives that she knew about her husband and Miss Pumpkin.\n\nAccording to Theresa Mapes, the mother of Mapes-Crupi, on around July 2, Mapes-Crupi discovered that Crupi didn\u2019t get his master\u2019s degree and hadn\u2019t attended classes that she\u2019d paid for.\n\n\u201cWe had found out that he was a horrible husband and a horrible person,\u201d said DeOliveira. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have an eyewitness, we didn\u2019t have a murder weapon.\u201d\n\nSimeonette Mapes-Crupi. Photo: Oxygen\n\nShocking evidence found at crime scene and on laptop\n\nInvestigators searched the couple's home again. In a closet that originally had been blocked by the victim\u2019s dead body, they found a throwaway cell phone in Crupi\u2019s coat. It verified Crupi\u2019s calls to Miss Pumpkin.\n\nDetectives also recovered Crupi\u2019s laptop. While investigators waited on a search warrant for the device, they dug deeper into Miss Pumpkin\u2019s possible role in the crime.\n\nAutopsy results showed that Mapes-Crupi had been killed in the early morning hours of July 5.\n\nA thorough search into Miss Pumpkin and her whereabouts at the time of the murder cleared her as a suspect, said DeOliveira.\n\nPolice concluded that her DNA was on the crime-scene door handle because of touch DNA. \u201cHe had his hands all over her and then used the door handle,\u201d said DeOliveira.\n\nSuspicions surrounding Crupi mounted. His laptop search history \u201cwas disturbing to say the least,\u201d said Cosenza. Crupi had searched for how to clean up a crime scene, how to suffocate someone, and how to cut a throat.\n\nThese queries dated several months back. \u201cHe\u2019s been planning this for some time,\u201d Cosenza said. \u201cThis is a sick individual.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kelly Siegler Speaks Out About David Temple's Retrial: \"It's Time for People to Hear the Truth\"\n\nJonathan Crupi charged and tried for murder\n\nIn November of 2012, Crupi was arrested at his parents\u2019 house in Brooklyn. As DeOliveira built the case, she briefed Mapes-Crupi\u2019s family about what detectives had learned about Crupi.\n\n\u201cWe found out there was a strip joint right next door to school. That\u2019s where Jonathan spent most of his day,\u201d said Theresa Mapes. \u201cWe found out that Jonathan had visited a hooker right after he murdered my daughter.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s theory was that Mapes-Crupi confronted her husband about not attending school and his philandering with sex workers. They believe he pushed her down the stairs, stabbed her 15 times, and tried to make it look like a home intruder killed her.\n\nIn June of 2015, a five-week trial began. In July of that year, Crupi was found guilty of second-degree murder.

A case in point is the PCL780 Pool Vacuum. It\u2019s designed to be used in pools, hot tubs, and spas, submergible up to 13 feet thanks to an IPX8 rating. This pool vacuum features a 1.7-liter tank, with suction levels of up to 13 GPM.

The RY14AM12 Automotive Pressure Washer has a max flow rate of 1.8 GPM and a top pressure level of 1200 PSI. These specs are ideal for washing cars, trucks, boats, and other vehicles, giving you the power to blast through grime without damaging your paint or finish.\n\nA compact stubby trigger handle also enables one-handed use and reduces vibration levels compared to a standard pressure washer handle. Like many pressure washers, this tool is equipped with interchangeable nozzles, including 15\u00b0, 25\u00b0, and 40\u00b0 and a foaming nozzle.\n\nModel: Ryobi RY14AM12\n\nMax flow rate: 1.8 GPM\n\nMax pressure rate: 1200 PSI\n\nCompact trigger handle\n\nIncludes a variety of nozzles\n\n40-ft high-pressure hose\n\nPrice: $149\n\nRyobi 18V One+ HP Brushless 1/2-inch Hammer Drill\n\nRyobi announced several new additions to the 18V One+ lineup for 2025, starting with a Gen II hammer drill.

For impact rates, this hammer drill reaches up to 34,400 BPM for powering through tough materials.\n\nRyobi also released a new drill/driver with the same specs, which knocks $20 off the price tag, but you lose out on the hammering function. If you have the option, we highly recommend going after the hammer drill over the drill/driver to have the hammering function at hand in case you need it for heavier-duty applications like drilling into concrete or masonry.\n\nModel: Ryobi PBLHM102\n\nMax speed: 2150 RPM\n\nMax torque: 820 in-lbs\n\nImpact rate: 34,400 BPM\n\nTwo speed modes\n\n1/2-inch ratcheting metal chuck\n\nDrill/driver also available (model PBLDD02)\n\nPrice: $129 bare / $179 kit with 4.0Ah battery and charger (hammer drill); $159 kit (drill driver);\n\nRyobi 18V One+ HP Brushless 4-Mode 1/4-inch Impact Driver\n\nAnother new driving tool on the 18V One+ system, the PBLID04 delivers speeds topping out at 3400 RPM.

            "content": "Testing pressure washers isn't an exact science. Mostly I sprayed stuff. A lot of stuff.\n\nThe evaluation started when I opened each box. A couple of the pressure washers were packed so well you'd think they were solid gold, and for a couple of others, I'm surprised there weren't more broken pieces than I ended up with (which was just a couple of small plastic covers).\n\nI then had to assemble each washer from the pressure hose to the wand nozzle tip. I like to assemble things so that part of the process wasn't so bad. There aren't too many surprises when it comes to pressure washer builds. It's either going to be an upright gas-powered pressure washer cart or a low and wide (and usually heavier) type of model. For the electric models, assembly was generally more complete out of the box. Usually just a couple of plastic covers or handles to attach.\n\nI like the integrated hose reel on this unit. As well, I'm a fan of the spray wand dock with the additional tip support at the bottom of the unit. Steve Conaway/CNET\n\nAll but a couple of the units made good use of current efficiencies in the assembly process, such as spring-loaded pins or other geometrically snapping pieces. The outlier, from the lesser-known brand Teande, still relied on bolts and lock nuts for everything. It came with a screwdriver and wrenches, but I still spent as long assembling that one washer as I did all the others combined. The Rock&Rocker electric unit also relied largely on physical screws for assembly.\n\nMy favorite thing about this unit is its ability to effectively store and transport all of its pieces. Shown here are the spray nozzle tips with integrated storage on the spray nozzle handle. Steve Conaway/CNET\n\nThe next thing I looked for was how they handled the different pressure nozzle tip types. A big contention point for me is when a manufacturer decides to offer less than the five standard nozzle tips. It's often the yellow 15-degree tip that gets bumped, and for me, that's the money tip. I have lots of concrete outside of my house and using anything other than a yellow tip would take me forever to finish. The yellow tip is probably the one I use the most overall, not just for concrete. Yes, I'm aware you can buy one for a few bucks, but they probably only cost a few cents to make.\n\nA major note on this topic: For electric pressure washers, the standard seems to be offering the turbo tip and two to three other tips, almost always excluding the red tip. This is likely due to the normally lower-than-gas-models' psi range, but I still like the options, even at the lower pressure ranges.\n\nI was excited when I reached this point with the Ryobi gas-powered pressure washer and its five-in-one nozzle design. Imagine all five tips being available at all times. My excitement faded when I realized that Ryobi, like so many others, had neglected the 15-degree tip and in its place had a second soap and detergent surface cleaner nozzle. Plus one bonus point for a five-in-one. It lost one point for no 15-degree option, plus it lost 10 points for getting my hopes up. The Craftsman CMCPW250D1 comes with a five-in-one tip that includes the 0, 15, 25, 40 and soap tips.\n\nSpeaking of surface cleaner soap and detergents, they've gotta go somewhere, and the best place is an onboard reservoir. I don't often use detergents with my pressure washer. When I do, and when I need to move, it's annoying to deal with the hose (even when the washer has a hose reel), the spray nozzle wand, the bucket of detergent and the high-pressure washer itself. With an onboard reservoir, you can just move the gas pressure washer while still holding the wand, letting the pressure washer hose drag behind you. I love the simple efficiency of it. The Teande was on my bad side after the assembly process, but I did like that it tried including two detergent reservoirs, each separately controlled.\n\nThe Teande's double reservoir. Steve Conaway/CNET\n\nHaving two separate reservoirs allows you to load two different types of detergent simultaneously. This is handy if you have varied hard surfaces you're trying to clean, and need to switch back and forth. Otherwise, with a single reservoir, you'd be forced to deplete the first detergent entirely before loading the second.\n\nThe rest is really just an inventory game. All the models have power washer hoses and spray wands. As previously mentioned, only the DeWalt stood out in those categories. They all have wheels, varying engine sizes, extra parts, oil and so on. The Craftsman did have one unique feature that I liked: a rope guide for the engine pull cord that moved the resting spot for the pull handle up above the engine on the frame closer to you if you were standing behind it. After so many hours of dealing with pressure washers, I was happy not to have to bend over quite as far to start this one.",

            "content": "As a Florida native who went to college in Syracuse, NY (one of the country\u2019s snowiest cities), I\u2019ve experienced my fair share of weather shock, especially when it comes to heavy snowfall. I had no choice but to get familiar with certain winter essentials \u2014 like a snow blower and even a salt spreader \u2014 fast.\n\nSnow shovels are another must-have tool for managing hefty snow buildup and keeping the outside of your home looking neat. To find the best ones, I spoke with a snow and ice management expert and a lawn appliances expert for their guidance and recommendations.\n\nSKIP AHEAD How I picked the best snow shovels | Top-rated snow shovels | How to shop for snow shovels | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nHow I picked the best snow shovels\n\nThere are a few important aspects to consider while shopping for a snow shovel. Here\u2019s what I kept in mind, per expert guidance, when making this list:\n\nShovel type: Different types of snow shovels exist, and each one is best for a specific task. A scooping shovel is best for lifting light or heavy snow and throwing it out of the way, according to Tom Canete, the CEO and president of Canete Snow Management. \u201cThese shovels typically have a deeper, narrower blade, making them suitable for small or irregular spaces, or for moving snow longer distances,\u201d says Canete. Another common type is the push shovel (also known as a plowing shovel or snow pusher), which is best for hauling light fresh snow, according to Canete. \u201cThese shovels often have a curved blade and are designed to push snow to the side,\u201d he says. I\u2019ve included both shovel types below.\n\nHandle shape: Prioritize ergonomic snow shovels with an angled handle, as it can help you maintain balance when you scoop, and prevent pain to your body, particularly your back, hands and wrists, according to Canete. I included shovels with a handle shaped like a capital letter D, which \u201coffers better grip and control while shoveling, especially with scooping shovels,\u201d he says.\n\nBlade type: Canete also recommends considering both blade and edge type. Blade refers to the scooping mechanism of the shovel \u2014 it\u2019s usually either plastic or metal, according to Canete. \u201cPlastic is lightweight and resists rusting,\u201d he says. Though, in some cases, it may be more practical to use a metal-edged snow shovel because \u201cit can help scrape off snow more efficiently, though it can make scooping more difficult,\u201d Canete says. With that said, Canete recommends using metal blade snow shovels for very heavy piles of snow or for scraping hardened ice on the ground. I included snow shovels with both plastic and metal blades.\n\nSnow type and texture: The texture and weight of snow will determine which type of shovel is best to use, which means it may be helpful to have both types in your arsenal. \u201cFor lighter snowfalls, a [snow] pusher allows you to move the snow like a plow on a truck,\u201d says Lou Manfredini a home expert at Ace Hardware. \u201cA scooper lets you grab the snow and throw it out of the way.\u201d (The inclusion of products sold by Ace Hardware in this article was made independently of Manfredini.)\n\nWant more from NBC Select?

All but one of the shovels on this list have an ergonomic, D-shaped handle and a handful of them have a curved body toward the bottom.\n\nThis snow shovel, which has a 4.5-star average rating from 3,995 reviews on Amazon, is perfect for shoveling, hauling and moving relatively light and powdery snow around your lawn or yard. It has two D-shaped handles on the body, which provide a great amount of support, meaning you can use it without a ton of strain. The shovel only weighs around four pounds, and is a great option for someone who doesn\u2019t have a strong back.\n\nShovel type: scooping | Blade material: plastic | Blade length: 18 in. | Overall length: 48 in.\n\nThis snow shovel, which has a 4.6-star average rating from 2,584 reviews on Amazon, has a tall blade and a D-shaped handle to make lifting and throwing snow on the ground easy. The blade is also 14 inches wide, meaning it holds a decent amount of snow with each scoop, ultimately saving you time on lawn maintenance.\n\nShovel type: scooping | Blade material: metal | Blade length: 18 in. | Overall length: 48 in.\n\nThe True Temper Mountain Mover snow shovel has a unique bent shaft at the bottom, which can help provide support to your body as you shovel snow and prevent you from having to bend down as far since the blade is sitting at a lower angle. It also has a nylon attachment that runs along the blade to help the shovel last longer, as it comes in contact with the hard concrete and other surfaces. It has a 4.4-star average rating from 1,468 reviews at Home Depot.\n\nShovel type: scooping | Blade material: plastic | Blade length: 18 in. | Overall length: 54 in.\n\nThe True Temper Snow Pusher has a metal shaft and a plastic blade that is over a foot in length, making it easier to push powdery snow across the ground and out of the way. Rather than a D-shaped handle, it has a more unique form, though you can still use it to hang the shovel on a sturdy hook in your home or storage room, since it\u2019s only around five pounds.\n\nShovel type: pushing | Blade material: plastic | Blade length: 8.5 in. | Overall length: 56.5 in.\n\nThis snow shovel is an ideal choice when you need to shift snow, like from the sidewalk to the curb, for example, without having to actually lift or carry it. It has a 4.8-star average rating from 87 reviews at AceHardware, a curved handle which provides support to the body and a D-shaped handle to make it easy to grasp when pushing snow along the rough concrete. To help the edge of the blade from getting damaged as you work, it has a strip of nylon material attached to it.\n\nShovel type: scooping | Blade material: metal | Blade length: 19 in. | Overall length: 56.5 in.\n\nBringing together the space consciousness of a snow push-style shovel and the power of a snow blower, the Earthwise battery-powered snow shovel makes it substantially easier to move snow (up to 300 pounds) across surfaces such as a driveway, sidewalk or street. It has wheels in the back so you smoothly push it across snow-covered surfaces \u2014 as it moves, it pushes snow out of the way to create a clear pathway. The wheeled shovel, which has a 4.1-star average rating from 2,869 reviews on Amazon, is equipped with a 40-volt brushless motor (similar to a vacuum) and comes with a charger, according to the brand.\n\nShovel type: electric thrower | Blade material: n/a | Blade length: n/a | Overall length: 43 in.\n\nHow to shop for snow shovels\n\nThink about the following factors as you consider your options:\n\nSnow texture\n\nAccording to both Manfredini and Canete, snow that is soft, powdery and light in texture and weight is logically easier to move, so a plastic-blade snow shovel is an appropriate choice. Powder-like snow is also easy to maneuver with a snow pusher-style shovel, says Canete. On the other hand, heavier snow may require the use of a metal snow shovel given its weight. Depending on the weather, it may be best to have both a metal and plastic snow shovel on hand.\n\nOrthopedic health\n\nIf you are older and/or have issues related to back, hand or wrist pain, it\u2019s especially important to look for a shovel with an ergonomic handle, according to Manfredini. \u201cThere are ergonomic handles on some snow shovels that basically help you from needing to bend as far when grabbing the snow and throwing it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe battery [operated] snow shovels are a great solution for someone with back issues.\u201d\n\nFrequently asked questions Is a metal or plastic snow shovel better? Both plastic and metal snow shovels have their benefits and drawbacks. Plastic snow shovels are more lightweight than metal ones but they aren\u2019t always as sturdy. Metal options are heavier, making it potentially harder to lift and throw snow around. Plus, certain types of shovels are more appropriate for handling different textures of snow, according to Canete.\n\nMeet our experts\n\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

            "content": "By the end of last year, my motivation, much like the ink in all my pens, was dried up, good as gone. The only thing I really felt like doing was sitting by the fireplace and staring at the snowfall\u2014but there was no snow to speak of nor a comforting glow to lounge by. There were no ideas brewing in my mind of what I wanted to focus on come 2025. The goals I set for myself in 2024 had, for the most part, been checked off as \u201ccomplete.\u201d Instead of feeling like a celebration was in order, I felt like a step back was necessary to reflect on my relentless need to enact, document, assess, keep going. So here I am, learning and growing, ready to share some of that never-ending process with you. Let me tell you about what I set out to do last year and what\u2019s made this year already different.\n\nGoal #1: Make a Birdhouse (or 2)\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Except I\u2019m not a woodworker, or a power-tool user, or a casual Home Depot shopper. Totally out of my league. But I wanted to do it for the birds, to shelter a feathered family who might be in the market for a place to stay and raise their babies. Of course, as soon as I left the proverbial comfort zone things went awry. The correct boards were not procured the first time around (I should have recognized sooner that trying to build a birdhouse out of two-by-fours was in no way going to work). It took multiple trips to Home Depot and the hardware store, phone calls with my handyman of a father, a few moments of despair, moving on after disagreeing with him on the best way to measure and cut the boards, improvising in real time to form notches and openings, before the project got off the ground. I had all the sides, roofs, and floors to construct not two, but seven birdhouses. Yes, this is how my goals seem to go. I have a very reasonable idea that quickly morphs into something exponential.\n\nOn a rainy day at the end of March, I pieced together the boxes for the sparrows, the chickadees, the house wrens, the nuthatches. Gratification lingered in the air alongside the sawdust. By the first of April, I was outdoors with a ladder over my shoulder, hammering small metal nails into sturdy trees, seeing the little houses glow in the bright Spring light. It wasn\u2019t long until the swallows started swooping around to check them out, and the nuthatches started pecking away to excavate bigger holes, and the chickadees fluttered in and out, seeing if this was where they\u2019d spend the season.\n\nBut it was the house wren, so small they needed only a one-inch-wide entrance, who decided to move into the sparrow box with the largest opening, who proceeded to fill it up with twigs, eggs, hatchlings, fledglings\u2014at least three of them who graced the yard with trilling song and flitted to the bushes after they left the nest. In true house wren fashion, the devoted parents also blocked another nest box entrance with sticks, making sure no other bird would build too close to their home.\n\nWelcome home, birdies\n\nTedious beginnings, but a successful endeavor. In a couple months, I\u2019ll make sure the boxes are clear and secure, add some scratch marks outside the entrance for more grip, and see who returns, or arrives, to infuse new life into the world.\n\nGoal #2: Build a garden!\n\nWith the birdhouse goal completed, I became engrossed in my parents\u2019 garden project that made the previous woodwork look like child\u2019s play. Now we were building eight-foot by four-foot by two-foot raised garden beds; we were moving what felt like (and might literally have been) tons of old logs to fill the bottom of the beds (I couldn\u2019t stop saying hugelkultur the whole time); then cubic yard upon cubic yard of garden soil, bucketed and wheelbarrowed and dumped until all ten rectangular beds were topped off in luscious brown earth.\n\nWe toiled away moving soil this day (and many days to come).\n\nHere in Washington, a garden without a fence spells deer fodder and disappointment: Now was the time to dig fence post holes. An auger got us started but wouldn\u2019t churn the deeper rocky layer, and my mom and sisters found it funny to look out and see my dad and me laying flat on the ground, one arm down a two foot hole, pulling rocks and scraping soil until we got to the proper depth. The dirt will forever be caked into my clothes from that day.\n\nThe climax of the garden build came as the concrete got poured and the fence posts went up. Tempers were running hot, so was the weather. Posts needed to be level\u2014our heads were decidedly not. Well, it wouldn\u2019t be a family garden project if we didn\u2019t pop off at least once, and then end the day with Taco Bell (a good reminder that I never again need to eat their soggy burritos).\n\nWithin the next week, the fencing panels were attached to the posts and planting could finally begin. July 1st and my mom\u2019s struggling plant starters got put to bed, and they would see temperatures in the 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0F+ range for nearly five weeks. The summer was sweltering, the timing not ideal, but this garden put down her roots. Enough zucchinis grew to make zucchini bread, the peppers loved the heat, a few eggplants bulged and the strawberries caught their second wind mid-August. Frost came in early October.\n\nGardens reek of potential, and this one is no different. What wonders the Earth and some hard-working hands create this year we soon will see!\n\nGoal #3: Improve my running\n\nYou could say this goal is as vague as it gets, but I\u2019m no newbie to this goal-setting game. Although these details weren\u2019t explicitly written down anywhere, I knew exactly what \u2018improvement\u2019 meant: 1. It meant running at least 50 miles per month, for a total of 600 miles or more (surpassing my highest yearly mileage by about 50).\n\n2. It meant running a half-marathon every single month, to get long runs under my feet whether I was racing or not.\n\n3. It meant becoming a more efficient racer, one who doesn\u2019t start too fast, one who becomes the passer at the end, not the passed.\n\nYou could also say I had my work cut out for me.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\n1. I averaged 52.2 miles per month, for a total of 626.6 miles in 2024. This was a 70+ mile increase from my previous annual high back in 2022, and a 200 mile increase from 2023. The best part was, I was injury free. My body handled the load. The toughest month came in June, when the garden project was at it\u2019s peak. The last week of that month, I checked my mileage: 16 miles down, 34 to go. What time is it?\n\nGo time. My last week of running in June turned out like this:\n\nMonday, June 24: 5.6 mile run\n\nWednesday, June 26: 8.3 mile run\n\nFriday, June 28: 7 mile run\n\nSunday, June 30: 13.1 mile run\n\nI swore I\u2019d never let it get that close again, and it didn\u2019t, but this was a telling month for me. I continued to push for my goals beyond the point that it really made sense to be pushing so hard. More on that soon.\n\n2. I ran a half marathon each and every month of the year. This broke me down towards the end, November and December being painfully slow, no real conviction on the route, bad timing with my period. These longer runs took more preparation, and the good that came out of it was a better sense of how to fuel and hydrate to keep my stomach happy. No more bonking! LMNT kept me salty, and the energy gummies, when they didn\u2019t make me want to gag, kept the legs moving.\n\n3. I became a more efficient racer, but not until late in the year. My breakthrough happened in September at a 25K trail race. I was determined to not get over-hyped at the start line \u2013 to play it cool, real cool, until halfway through. Keep it low, take it easy, that was the motto. And boy did it work. Little by little, mile by mile, the people I\u2019d watched race ahead came back into view, slowly but surely. Passing one, then another. People I never expected to see again faded into my trail of dust. The Otterpops at the finish line were the cherry on top to a good day on the mountain.\n\nTarget in sight.\n\nBy October, I set my sights on running faster. My trail running pace was not competitive in the road running sphere, and the remaining races would be more road than trail. So in true Paige fashion, I did what I set out to do.\n\n25K on October 13: 4 minute PR from my previous time on the same course, defending my age-group category win.\n\n10K on October 20: New PR by 30 seconds.\n\n5K on October 30: New PR by 90 seconds.\n\nThis showed me that it wasn\u2019t until 10 months into my goal (plus the 11 years of prior running) that my body was fully adapted to this new routine. After the races were over in October, I relaxed the pace again and just got the mileage in. But now I know the feelings of a new pain threshold and the withholding of outright effort until the right moment. Feelings like that are hard to forget. Running continues to stoke the competitive side of me.\n\nGoals #4, 5, 6, 7\u2026.\n\nI wish I had enough foresight to set three nice, clean goals and call it good. Was that not enough to fill up my months? Apparently not. I also took on the challenge of going back to school for a graduate degree. We decided to dive into tidying our house, Marie Kondo style. I wanted to swim at least once every month, but that petered out in Fall when the weather got cold and I was a little frayed at the edges. I wanted to read a book every week; I ended the year at 42.\n\nSo what did all this goal-setting show me? Why am I trying so dang hard? I believe most of this comes from a genuine energy of being excited to live life, to be in this world, to have the ability to move my body, make things with my hands, help others. But it also has a slight tinge of desperation about it. What am I doing if I\u2019m not doing anything?\n\nInstead of letting life reveal itself to me, it seems like Paige of 2024 wanted to assert her will over anything and everything that could. And that accomplished a lot, but I can\u2019t say it was all done with a light heart and happy spirit. The demon of productivity and progress still whispers in my ear.\n\nBut this year, 2025 Paige is happily letting go of some of her obsessiveness of recording facts and figures and events and minutia. She is writing down what seems urgent, more poetry, a few to-dos, sweet ideas for others. Trusting that she\u2019ll remember the good times, because she was there and enjoying them as they happened. She\u2019s still running, over 60 miles this month (which tells me that the outline of a goal, like 50 miles/month, can be stifling). Have I run a half-marathon yet? No, and I won\u2019t, because it\u2019s raining and I simply don\u2019t feel like it (and I have gobs of homework to get through).\n\nBut I also want to keep this Substack alive, which is why I finally said I\u2019ll write this today instead of digging into my school assignments and leaving no energy for myself by day\u2019s end.\n\nI\u2019m working on being more flexible \u2013 yoga, rolling out, warm ups and cool downs, yes; but also, exploring ideas and thoughts I\u2019ve not entertained before. Rolling with what the day presents to me, releasing trivial sequences of tasks to see what actually needs my attention. I don\u2019t feel any less challenged than last year. In fact, I may be challenged even more, because this attitude changes the structure of my week. There are things I will always be doing, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t listen too.\n\nI\u2019m playing with the mental shift of how much a single year should determine who I am and what I accomplish within its 365 days. Isn\u2019t that a pretty arbitrary time window, anyways? I had thoughts that maybe this post wasn\u2019t worth posting, now that January has come and gone and New Year\u2019s reflections could be ill-received this \u201clate.\u201d Which is precisely where the flexibility comes into play, not letting imaginary deadlines dictate when or what I create or reflect upon.\n\nSo this is where I leave you, for now, until next time, until the next story, of which there will always be more. My goal setting has illuminated my path forward, and that isn\u2019t a repeat of last year\u2019s path. It\u2019s a little wilder, a little more overgrown, but I\u2019m a little more sure-footed and still smiling, wanting to sing it out to everybody, \u201cwhat a joy, what a life, what a chance\u201d to be alive today.",

It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Home Depot and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights have reached a $65,000 settlement for a Twin Cities store employee who suffered years of sexual harassment on the job.\n\nThe department announced the settlement on Thursday following its investigation which found the victim, now a former employee, was subjected to harassment from three other employees at Home Depot's Fridley location between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe victim reported the harassment on multiple occasions, but management took \"little to no action,\" according to the department, violating Minnesota's Human Rights Act.\n\n\"My experience was deeply painful, and my goal in coming forward was not just to stand up for myself but also to raise awareness so that nobody else would ever have to go through what I went through,\" the victim said in a statement released by the department.\n\nBesides the financial settlement, Home Depot also entered into a compliance agreement that will be monitored for the next two years, requiring the corporation to \"create a workplace free from sexual harassment by enforcing anti-harassment politics, conducting training on those policies, and holding store managers accountable,\" according to the department.\n\n\"I hope my journey and the policy changes outlined in the settlement agreement helps pave the way for a safer, more respectful environment for all employees,\" the victim said.\n\nHome Depot shared a statement after a request from WCCO.\n\n\"We don't tolerate harassment in any form and are committed to respect for all people. We settled this matter so we can focus on our business,\" the statement said.\n\nIn 2023, the department entered into a consent decree with the owner of several metro McDonald's restaurants after a 14-year-old employee was sexually assaulted by her manager.\n\nThat same year, the department reached a sexual harassment settlement with a Vadnais Heights-based charter school district after a teacher assaulted a ninth-grade student.\n\nVictims of harassment in the workplace or schools are urged to report violations to the department on its website.\n\nSexual Assault Resources\n\nGeneral Sites for information related to sexual assault and resources throughout Minnesota:\n\nGeneral Sexual Assault Websites:",

(NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, reflected on the uncertainty surrounding the year 2025, focusing on several macroeconomic questions that are top of mind for him. One of the important questions Cramer was the future movement of the 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nSpecifically, he wondered whether it would drop to 4%, climb to 5%, or simply stay where it is. According to Cramer, this is the most important question currently facing the market. He pointed out that ever since the Federal Reserve began cutting short-term rates in September 2024, an unusual dynamic has taken place.\n\nFrom the moment the first rate cut occurred, long-term interest rates began to rise sharply, a trend Cramer found highly unconventional. Cramer posed the crucial question: will the yield continue to rise toward that 5% mark, or will it begin to fall again?\n\n\u201cAs far as stocks are concerned, I think they\u2019ll do well if the yield on the 10-year peaks out and go slower, even if it basically sits here between 4.5% and 4.6%, the market should do fine. However, if long rates keep climbing with the 10-year reaching 5%, well, it could be truly miserable for the stock market at least short term.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently and 7 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nAnother critical issue Cramer pondered was the state of the labor market. Despite signs of economic softening in recent months, unemployment remains exceptionally low, which is contributing to a strong overall labor market. According to Cramer, this is the reason many are hopeful for a \u201csoft landing\u201d after the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive rate hikes in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\u201cSo can the labor market stay strong this year? Right now, I\u2019m betting it can. Remember the labor market was great during the first three years of the original Trump administration. We had 3.5% unemployment right before COVID hit and everything fell apart. Plus, if Trump pushes through mass deportations\u2026 it could cause a major labor shortage. If anything, we probably should be worrying about whether the labor market will get too tight, causing severe wage inflation.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during episodes of Mad Money aired on January 3rd and January 6th. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

An MDHR investigation found a Fridley employee was sexually harassed by three co-workers from 2018 to 2021. As part of the settlement, the company has agreed to pay $65,000 to the former employee and implement changes to prevent future sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Human Rights (MDHR) announced on Thursday that Home Depot has agreed to pay $65,000 to a former employee as part of a settlement agreement for failing to stop sexual harassment spanning multiple years.\n\nHome Depot investigation\n\nThe backstory:\n\nAn MDHR investigation into Home Depot reportedly found an employee at a store in Fridley filed several sexual harassment reports over a span of approximately three years.\n\nAccording to the press release, the employee was sexually harassed by three co-workers who made \"unwelcome sexual comments, advances and inappropriate touching.\"\n\nMDHR said Home Depot took \"little to no action\" when it came to the reports, and that inaction allowed the harassment to continue.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"My experience was deeply painful, and my goal in coming forward was not just to stand up for myself but also to raise awareness so that nobody else would ever have to go through what I went through,\" the former employee said in a statement. \"I hope my journey and the policy changes outlined in the settlement agreement helps pave the way for a safer, more respectful environment for all employees.\"\n\nSettlement reached\n\nDig deeper:\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement agreement, Home Depot will pay out $65,000 to the former employee. Additionally, the company must enforce anti-harassment policies, provide training for employees, and ensure accountability for store managers.\n\n\"Sexual harassment is a violation of the law and a denial of basic human dignity,\" said Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero. \"It harms individuals' mental health, job performance, and well-being, while also undermining organizational integrity and productivity. Minnesota state law requires that employers create a workplace free from sexual harassment and assault. This agreement reminds Minnesota employers of this obligation.\"\n\nThe MDHR said it will oversee the compliance of these measures over the next two years.",

Last March, the company launched a delivery service for its professional customers that will ship goods directly from its distribution centers to their job sites.\n\nDespite elevated housing costs and mortgage rates, Home Depot recently saw a boost in its earnings results. In Q3, the company\u2019s net sales increased 6.6% year over year to $40.2 billion, and its gross profit rose 5.4% to $13.4 billion.",

The company went public in 1981, trading on the NASDAQ before transitioning to the NYSE in 1984 under the ticker HD. It rapidly expanded through organic growth and strategic acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOver the years, HD has prioritized innovation, enhancing its supply chain, growing its e-commerce presence, and investing in services for contractors and consumers alike. By 2025, it operated over 2,300 stores across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. As a blue chip stock, HD is celebrated for its consistent financial performance, shareholder dividends, and its role as a key indicator of the housing and construction industries.\n\nHD's Stock Split History\n\nSince its IPO in 1981, HD has executed 13 stock splits, all occurring before 1999. These splits, including multiple 2-for-1 and 3-for-2 splits, were implemented during periods of robust expansion and solidifying market dominance.\n\nThe final split occurred in 1999, after which HD shifted its focus to maintaining a higher stock price, rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks instead.",

(NYSE:HD) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio. The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading American company in the home improvement retail sector, offering a diverse range of tools, construction products, appliances, and services, including fuel and transportation rentals.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported sales of $40.2 billion, a 6.6% increase year on year. However, comparable sales fell by 1.3% during the quarter. Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.67 per share, compared to $3.8 billion, or $3.81 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Furthermore, the company has spent $649 million on common stock repurchases, compared to $6.5 billion the previous year.\n\nAlthough macroeconomic factors have played a significant role in the company\u2019s recent struggles, investors may find its 60% payout ratio appealing. With an operating cash flow of more than $15 billion in the first nine months of 2024, the company\u2019s cash position remains strong. Furthermore, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) maintains its reputation by paying regular dividends, which are currently $2.25 per share quarterly, with a yield of 2.17%.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about HD in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile Home Depot, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company\u2019s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.\u201d\n\nOverall, HD ranks 2nd on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of HD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC reminded viewers about the Trump playbook in the story market and said that he never believed the President would start a new trade war with China. Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter.\n\n\u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d\n\nCramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios.\n\n\u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC.

You clicked this headline because you're sick of swiping left on ding-dongs who make their first photo on Tinder themselves holding a huge fish. We get it, you're compensating for something else, sorry but I said it. Nobody cares about the fish your friend caught and then let you hold for the pic because you're the single friend. So where do you find a quality man left in Maine? You friggen go to the one store that men could spend all day in and not get board of touching saw dust. Home Depot.\n\nI say this all the time to girlies. If you want to meet a blue-collar handy Maine man that's probably not on dating apps, just go walk around Home Depot for a little bit pretending to look at things. If you're feeling frisky you can pull out the power move. Ask the cutest man you can find in an orange apron and ask if they will help you find the right screw driver.

If a dude is in there on a week day, say around 5p.m. he's most likely there because his girl asked him to make a vanity so he's grabbing supplies on his way home from work. If he's there on a weekday night past 8 p.m I bet he doesn't have a ring on his finger and he's most likely single and filling his time with building something.\n\nIs Home Depot busy weekends?\n\nSunday's are the busiest and you'll most likely only find families running around there so don't do that. There's two types of men that go into Home Depot's during the week or on a weekend night and it's married men- which we stay away from, and single men who spend their time building things instead of going to get drunk at the bar. Instead of shopping for tools, go shop for a whole ass man around 8 p.m.\n\nOr, if you're more into going on regular dates because you're not absolutely un-hinged like the rest of us, here's some top local restaurant ideas:\n\nREAD MORE: Food Network says this general store has the best must-try hamburgers in Maine\n\nThe 20 Most Popular Restaurants in Portland, Maine Right Now Here are the 20 most popular restaurants in Maine's largest city of Portland, according to TripAdvisor rankings.

That keeps a lot of people from going out and has caused a lot of people to have left,' he said, pointing to the usually busy commercial plaza where his business is located and that was now more quiet than usual.\n\nThe migration concerns of clergy and other community members in Springfield are shared by many faith leaders nationwide.

If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,' Homan, who is also the former head of ICE, said.\n\nOn Thursday, leaders of three Catholic organizations blasted the rule change that allows raids on churches and schools, saying in a joint statement that 'turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty... will not make our communities safer.'\n\nWhen pressed on the Catholic opposition, Homan stood firm. 'We're enforcing laws Congress enacted and the president signed. If they don't like it, change the law.'\n\nVice President JD Vance, who was also asked about the Catholic pushback in an interview broadcast Sunday, accused one group of being worried about losing funds in the immigration crackdown.\n\n'I think that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?' he told CBS's 'Face the Nation.'\n\nDonald Trump's crackdown on immigration has ramped up with federal agents arresting nearly 1,000 illegal migrants in one day\n\nAll eyes during Trump's first week in office have been on immigration enforcement and deportations, though it was unclear to what extent actions have increased from predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nHoman called on Congress to pass additional funding for dealing with those arrested.\n\n'We're gonna need more ICE beds, a minimum of 100,000,' he told ABC News. 'We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.'\n\nTrump has been unhappy with the number of arrests so far and has directed federal immigration officials to meet higher detention quotas, the Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nIt said he was ordering ICE to raise the arrest numbers from a few hundred a day to at least 1,200 to 1,500, citing people with knowledge of internal briefings.",

They are often more accessible to DIY newcomers thanks to their more manageable size and simpler application, lacking the steeper learning curve required for some more advanced tools. Even more experienced tool users can benefit from having these items in their arsenal, as they are useful for tasks that require a more delicate hand or need to be accomplished in tighter spaces. Likewise, those living in smaller areas can appreciate the minimal space that more compact tools take up.\n\nBut let's face it, a big reason why you were likely drawn to a certain mini tool was because it was so darn cute.

After a brief stint at a location on Archer Road, the fair\u2019s organizers decided on Depot Park as a temporary location in 2024. The city stuck with the venue for this year's fair as well after failing to find a larger venue in Gainesville.\n\nLili Tzou, the assistant director of the fair, said the city has searched for a bigger space.\n\n\u201cThe goal has always been to move to a bigger, permanent venue.\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been looking for a permanent site for quite a while now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really difficult to find the amount and type of land that we need in Gainesville.\u201d Tzou said.\n\nAmanda Renaud, half of the Topsy Turvy Show, showing off her hula hooping skills. (Rhiannon Thomas/WUFT News)\n\nSince moving to Depot Park, the fair hasn\u2019t been able to last for its typical three-weekend duration. Because it\u2019s a public park, it can\u2019t be fenced off for three weekends to host the fair, Tzou said.\n\n\u201cWe also aren\u2019t able to sell tickets because of this, which funds the fair itself,\u201d she added.\n\nMany attendees enjoyed the fact that the experience was free.\n\n\u201cI like that it\u2019s free now, because it didn\u2019t use to be,\u201d said University of Florida senior Yael Hamaoui, who has attended the fair since it was on Archer Road.\n\nThe downtown location is also more convenient for UF students.\n\n\u201cI think here [Depot Park] is better,\u201d UF senior Noah Wachsman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to drive.\u201d\n\nThe fair also offered many places to park for those who opted to drive. The Hoggetowne Medieval Faire website featured a map of parking locations, which included free, paid and ADA parking.\n\nFor those who parked at the garages downtown, EZ Event Rides had shuttles going between the garages and Depot Park.\n\nTzou said this year's event nearly doubled the number of merchants from last year.\n\n\u201cWe had about 90 this year,\u201d she said. This is up from the 57 vendors the event featured last year.\n\nYael Hamaoui and James Songster perform on stage after a magic trick. (Rhiannon Thomas/WUFT News)\n\nHamaoui enjoyed her experience more at Hoggetowne Downtown this year than last year.\n\n\u201cI feel like last time it was kind of last minute,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time was definitely better than last year.\u201d\n\nUF freshman Grace Tucceri also had a positive experience for her first time at the fair.\n\n\u201cThe venue was easy to navigate and just the right size,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked how the food was all in one area and the entertainment was spread out throughout the park.\u201d\n\nThere was no shortage of entertainment at the fair, either. Lily LaBelle and Amanda Renaud make up the Topsy Turvy Show, an acrobatic duo who entertained the crowds at the fair over the weekend.\n\nAnother entertainer, James Songster, featured Hamaoui in one of his shows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been picked for a show before, so that was actually really cool,\u201d she said. The show featured a mailbox where a bunny appeared with Songster\u2019s magic.\n\nDespite the online criticism about last year's Hoggetowne Downtown, this year's responses have been more supportive of Depot Park.\n\nOrganizers are still working to get the event out of Depot Park and into a venue where they can host the event for three weekends. The Hoggetowne Medieval Faire website mentions that its staff have reviewed over 40 potential locations and are continuing their search for a venue that can accommodate the size and needs of the event.",

            "content": "With 2,345 stores in total and trailing-12-month sales of $155 billion, Home Depot (HD -4.19%) is the clear leader in the home improvement industry. Its shares have been a huge winner, producing an unbelievable total return of 211,200% in the past four decades.\n\nThe business has been dealing with a recent slowdown, though, despite its position in the market. So, should you invest $1,000 in this top retail stock right now and hold for 10 years? Here's what investors need to know before making a decision.\n\nLatest challenges\n\nIn fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, Home Depot was able to report strong double-digit revenue growth, which was substantially above its long-term trend. Credit can be given to the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought low interest rates and saw households flush with cash that put more emphasis on renovation projects. Home Depot was a beneficiary.\n\nThings calmed down quite a bit since that demand surge. Consumers have been dealing with higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, so they haven't been inclined to tackle expensive home upgrades as much. This explains the 3.2% same-store sales decline Home Depot posted in fiscal 2023, with executives expecting a 2.5% drop for fiscal 2024.\n\nThis can certainly cause investors to worry about Home Depot and its sensitivity to macro factors. However, the company is still in a favorable position, something that's evident in the bigger picture.\n\nIndustry winner\n\nThe home improvement industry is absolutely massive, with management putting an annual sales figure for the market at about $1 trillion. Even though Home Depot is the largest player, it only commands about 15% share. This gives it tremendous runway to keep taking share from smaller rivals.\n\nHome Depot has durable competitive advantages that should allow it to keep winning over the long term. The brand recognition in the industry is second to none. And there are definitely scale-related benefits, like being able to invest heavily in supply chain capabilities to ensure wide product assortment, as well as improving the omnichannel setup so that customers can order items in ways most convenient for them.\n\nPositive industry factors also play to Home Depot's benefit. The aging housing supply, coupled with an ongoing housing inventory shortage, both provide a favorable backdrop for renovation demand over the long term. Also add in the fact that housing prices in the U.S. have climbed at a rapid clip over the past five years, and it's clear there's a lot of untapped home equity that can be utilized to tackle projects.\n\nValuation and capital returns\n\nInvestors can't ignore the price the market is asking them to pay. As of this writing, Home Depot shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.9. The stock has rarely been more expensive in the past decade, indicating improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E multiple represents a premium to the overall S&P 500.\n\nThis valuation isn't cheap. However, I can certainly understand why long-term investors might still consider buying the industry leader. Despite the latest headwinds, Home Depot's revenue and net income should be higher five or 10 years from now. Competitive strengths and industry tailwinds are also positive factors to keep in mind.\n\nInvestors will also appreciate Home Depot's capital returns. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, the company paid $6.7 billion in dividends. And over the last three years, it has repurchased enough outstanding stock to reduce the diluted share count by 6%.\n\nReturning lots of cash back to shareholders might be enough to overcome the rich valuation, which might make Home Depot a smart purchase for your portfolio today.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently broke down the market\u2019s performance on Tuesday, discussing how President Donald Trump\u2019s early days in office might be influencing investor sentiment. He speculated that the stock rally could be tied to a belief among investors that Trump\u2019s promises on tariffs may be harsher than his actual actions, leading to optimism.\n\nCramer pointed out that during Trump\u2019s first presidency, investors learned to buy stocks during moments of market volatility caused by his aggressive rhetoric. He noted that Trump\u2019s frequent saber-rattling would often prompt sell-offs, but those moments, when stocks of companies he criticized dropped, turned out to be prime opportunities to invest.\n\nCramer explained that this pattern of buying the dips was exactly what played out on Tuesday. After months of discussing high tariffs, Trump\u2019s inaugural speech struck a more tempered tone, and he avoided threatening severe trade barriers. According to Cramer, this shift in rhetoric surprised many, especially given how aggressive his stance had been in the past.\n\n\u201cMaybe four years is a long time ago, but people seem to forget the Trump drill. The president loves the stock market. He always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose and when it doesn\u2019t, well guess what? The market flies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed 9 Stocks for This Week\u2019s Game Plan and 9 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer also suggested that this latest market rally is driven by the prospect of tariffs, especially on tariffs that are smaller than initially forecasted. He mentioned that these could increase if foreign countries don\u2019t comply with U.S. demands. Furthermore, Cramer highlighted the role of new projects such as Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. He noted that this project, which will involve new data centers likely outfitted with Nvidia technology, was another contributing factor to the market\u2019s upbeat performance. Cramer noted that the presence of major tech leaders at the inauguration further reinforced optimism.",

(NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American home improvement retail company that sells building materials, lawn and garden products, home improvement and decor products, tools, construction equipment, and other materials used for repair and maintenance. It operates 2,345 retail stores and approximately 780 branches across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, other U.S. territories, 10 provinces of Canada, and Mexico.\n\nIn June 2024, the company completed the acquisition of SRS Distribution, Inc., one of the fastest-growing building products distributors in the U.S., for approximately $18.25 billion. The move is expected to raise The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\u2019s total addressable market to around $1 trillion, by helping accelerate growth with the residential professional customer.\n\nDuring the Q3 2024 earnings call on November 12, the company reported that SRS generated $2.9 billion of revenue during the third quarter, and was on track to deliver $6.4 billion in sales contribution over seven months. Overall, the company-wide revenue was posted at $40.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. However, comparable sales declined 1.3%. Its stores in the U.S. also had negative comps of 1.2%.\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) experienced pressures on larger remodeling projects because of the general macroeconomic uncertainty and a higher interest rate environment. Despite the challenges, the financial performance in Q3 was better than what the management had anticipated, reflecting the company\u2019s resilience.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is also committed to shareholder returns. On November 14, it declared a third-quarter dividend of $2.25 per share to be paid on December 12. Wall Street analysts are bullish on The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) with a consensus Buy rating. It is among the stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 12th on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Yesenia Acosta leans in to get advice from an attorney during a public meeting in Delano that community groups hosted to educate immigrants on their legal rights.\n\nIn the early days of President Trump\u2019s first administration, several Kern County organizations launched a tip line people could contact if they spotted immigration enforcement activities underway.\n\nNearly three weeks ago, the hotline started ringing again. In panicked voices, callers reported witnessing U.S. Border Patrol agents questioning Latinos in parking lots and gas stations \u2014 and detaining people in large numbers. In some cases, they said, a loved one had been detained.\n\nVoices Hiltzik: Inside the Bakersfield raids that showed how Trump\u2019s immigration policies will sow chaos The U.S. Border Patrol ran rampant through Bakersfield in what immigration advocates say was nothing but racial profiling aimed at intimidation. More such raids are coming.\n\nThe Rapid Response Network of Kern sprang into action. Organization staff and volunteers fanned out across the Bakersfield area \u2014 to a Home Depot, a swap meet and other locations where the Border Patrol had been spotted. As they confirmed the raids, they attempted to document the scenes, including any violations of rights or use of force, as well as recording the names of people being detained and interviewing witnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the multi-day Border Patrol operation ended, 78 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to the El Centro sector of the Border Patrol.\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Agent Gregory K. Bovino, who leads the El Centro sector in the Imperial Valley along the Mexican border, said in statements on social media that agents had detained two child rapists and \u201cother criminals.\u201d He said agents also arrested people for being in the U.S. unlawfully.\n\nAdvocates on the scene, meanwhile, said that the operation indiscriminately targeted Latino farmworkers and day laborers, and that far more people were detained. They questioned why agents from El Centro \u2014 300 miles south \u2014 were conducting operations so far away from the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThough the rapid-response network is not designed to intervene in raids, its members played a vital support role by chronicling the operation and offering counsel for those who were detained, said Rosa Lopez, a senior policy advocate for the ACLU of Southern California, which is a partner in Kern County\u2019s network.\n\nRapid-response networks emerged across the state during the first Trump administration. The community-led groups became a first line of defense for immigrants overwhelmed by threats of raids and mass deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe premise was straightforward: People who see immigration or border agents in their community call or text a hotline. A dispatcher notifies volunteers, who respond to the reported address to confirm whether there is, in fact, an active operation. If verified, the dispatcher can send out a legal observer to monitor the situation, as well as an attorney to provide legal assistance.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with immigrants facing fewer deportation threats under the Biden administration, many networks pivoted to providing people with information about vaccines and food assistance.\n\nBut after Trump was elected in November amid promises to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, local organizations are dusting off the rapid-response networks they built eight years ago.\n\nIn the first days of his new term, Trump issued a slew of executive orders closing down legal avenues to asylum and declaring illegal immigration a national emergency at the southern border. Public sentiment could be on his side. A recent poll from the New York Times and Ipsos found that 55% of Americans strongly or somewhat support deporting all immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nAlong with providing legal defense to immigrants detained by authorities, much of what the networks do is preventative. They inform community members about their rights to ask for a warrant if ICE shows up at their door and to not answer questions. They urge people to document the encounter and report the incident. They also ensure families have an emergency plan.\n\nThey use text messaging and social media to warn people of confirmed operations, and more often, to tamp down the rumors that can spur people to stay home from work and keep their kids home from school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur primary goal is to build power, not panic,\u201d said Lisa Knox, co-executive director and legal director for the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, which supports rapid-response networks in the state. \u201cOne of the biggest roles that these community networks can play is in spreading accurate information and dispelling misinformation.\u201d\n\nEven before Trump was inaugurated this week, rapid-response networks kicked into high gear as the Bakersfield-area raids unleashed a wave of fear across the Central Valley, where a largely immigrant workforce helps harvest a quarter of the food grown in the U.S.\n\nAt least half of the state\u2019s 162,000 farmworkers are undocumented, according to estimates from the federal Department of Labor and research conducted by UC Merced. Many of those workers have children or spouses who were born here.\n\nIn the weeks following the Bakersfield raid, the Rapid Response Network of Kern has helped distribute groceries to more than 200 families who have been afraid to leave their homes, and coordinated rides for people fearful of driving themselves to work. Network partners are exploring emergency rental assistance for families who lost income after the raids.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s high panic,\u201d said Blanca Ojeda, an organizer for Faith in the Valley, which helms the Valley Watch Network, a rapid-response network serving communities from Kern to San Joaquin counties. \u201cThe activity in Kern \u2026 just heightened everyone\u2019s senses and just made us a little more suspicious of everyone.\u201d\n\nThe Inland Empire Rapid Response Network \u2014 which hadn\u2019t received a call in eight months \u2014 has gotten nearly 140 calls and text messages alerting it to possible immigration enforcement operations in the weeks since the Bakersfield operation, according to the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolunteers with the network have responded to more than 70 reports in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The group posts updates on Instagram, which so far have mostly served to dispel rumors of immigration agent sightings. It had confirmed at least two on social media as of Friday afternoon.\n\nTrying to respond to reports of raids in a region spanning more than 27,000 square miles is no easy task, said Javier Hernandez, the coalition\u2019s executive director. To meet that demand, the Inland Empire network is aiming to have bilingual dispatchers available from 4 a.m. to midnight daily and is in the process of training 300 responders.\n\nThe Valley Watch Network faces a similar challenge. It has trained more than 90 people since late last year and is trying to recruit more legal observers to respond to possible enforcement activities in the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s far-flung farming communities.\n\n\u201cWe just want to be able to mobilize as quickly as possible,\u201d Ojeda said, \u201cbecause it gives ICE the opportunity to leave that spot, and then we don\u2019t have any evidence of what occurred.\u201d",

Koffel, a fire safety expert who is accredited by the Society of Fire Protection Engineers, and Caileigh Peterson, the spokesperson and Radio Safety Specialist for Midland.\n\n\u201cIn the event of a fire, having a plan in place ensures that you and your loved ones can respond quickly and effectively, guaranteeing everyone is safe,\u201d Peterson shares. \u201cThis includes building a \u2018go kit\u2019 of essential items, like water, medicine, and first-aid supplies to use while you\u2019re on the go.\u201d\n\nBoth Koffel and Peterson provided recommendations that can help prevent fires, contain fires, stop fires from spreading, and safety tools to help you navigate the emergency properly. Below you\u2019ll find their top picks, including must-have tools from Midland, Kiddle, and SentrySafe from $8.\n\nFire Safety Expert Emergency Picks\n\nMidland ER210 Emergency Crank Weather AM/FM Radio\n\nAmazon\n\n\u201cWhether you experience a house fire or are threatened with a wildfire, utilizing tools like NOAA Weather Radios are key to staying aware of danger,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cWhen a fire warning is issued by the National Weather Service, you'll be alerted right away through visual and audio alerts.\u201d This Midland emergency radio is built with three different power sources (solar, hand crank, and a rechargeable battery) so you can use it during a power outage. It also comes equipped with a LED flashlight, NOAA weather scan, AM/FM radio, and bright digital display. Plus, its compact size makes for easy storage in your purse or an emergency bag.\n\nFirst Alert Smoke Alarm\n\nAmazon\n\nSmoke alarms are non-negotiable items to have in your home, as they are crucial to notifying you when smoke from a potentially dangerous fire is present. \u201cAlmost three out of every five fire deaths from fires in homes occur in homes with no smoke alarm or no working smoke alarm,\u201d Koffel explains. This alarm from First Alert requires one 9-volt battery to operate, and it has a convenient front access compartment to make replacing batteries a breeze. It also has a test/silence button that guarantees it is in working shape, and an end-of-life warning to notify you when it needs to be replaced.\n\nKidde Multipurpose Home Fire Extinguisher\n\nWalmart\n\n\u201cHaving a fire extinguisher easily accessible is key to preventing the spread of indoor fires,\u201d says Peterson. While having a fire extinguisher at home is great, Koffel also stresses that knowing how to use the extinguisher is crucial and reminds us that it should not be used as a replacement for calling the fire department in the event of a serious emergency. The Kiddle home fire extinguisher is designed with a large gauge, so you know when it\u2019s ready to use, and it can spray as far as 8 feet in 8-12 seconds once the lever is pulled.\n\nThreshold 6-Piece Modern Bath Towels and Washcloths Set\n\nTarget\n\nTowels may be the last thing on your mind when you\u2019re dealing with a house fire, but Koffel notes that this common household item has great use in an emergency. \u201cA towel can be used to place under the closed door to potentially provide some additional time,\u201d he shares, adding, \u201cA face cloth, especially a wet one, can help one when they are exposed to smoke or hot air from the fire.\u201d This set of bath towels includes two washcloths, two hand towels, and two bath towels made from 100 percent terry cotton fabric, which provides a plush, soft, and comfortable feel.\n\nKiddle 3-Story Fire Escape Ladder\n\nHome Depot\n\nIf you have a home with more than one story, a portable fire escape ladder, like this one from Kiddle, is worth having on standby. \u201cA portable escape ladder provides a safe escape route for those who may be threatened by fires that prohibit them from safely exiting through the front or back door,\u201d Peterson says. This Kiddle ladder measures 25 feet long and features 1-foot, anti-slip metal rungs that can hold up to 750 pounds per rung. The heavy-duty, metal hooks attach to most windows, which allows you to quickly escape to safety.\n\nSentrySafe Fire-Resistant and Water-Resistant Box Safe\n\nWalmart\n\nWhen a disaster or an emergency occurs, you\u2019re often racing against the clock and may not have time to properly grab important items. This SentrySafe box safe can keep all of your documents, photos, heirloom jewelry, and other items safe in one place so you can grab it and go. It\u2019s constructed to withstand 1,550 degrees Fahrenheit for half an hour, and is fully waterproof for up to 72 hours. For passports, birth certificates, photos, etc., the safe is spacious enough to hold letter-size hanging files and folders, too.\n\nKidde Carbon Monoxide Detector & Explosive Gas Alarm\n\nAmazon\n\nThough not a fire detection device, the Kiddle duo carbon monoxide and explosive gas alarm can alert you of other issues in your home that could lead to a fire. The carbon monoxide detector can \u201cidentify when fuel-fired appliances are not working properly,\u201d Koffel notes, and further adds that a gas alarm can \u201cidentify when a gas leak occurs to allow one to take action before a fire occurs.\u201d The two-in-one alarm plugs into your wall, but it also has a backup 9-volt battery that keeps it running during a power outage. It\u2019s also equipped with a digital LED display plus an 85-decibel alarm that notifies you when carbon monoxide or explosive gas is present.\n\nJeld-Wen Molded Composite Interior Door Slab\n\nHome Depot\n\nYou may be wondering\u2014how is a door going to save me during a fire emergency? Though most homes have doors to separate rooms from hallways or one another, some homes, especially open concept ones, may not, which can pose a serious danger if a fire is present. \u201cThe ability to close a door behind you when you escape a room in which there is a fire or to close a door to separate you from the fire can result in an increase in the available safe escape time,\u201d Koffel explains. If your home is without interior doors in some areas, it may be worthwhile to put a few up, like this molded composite one. It\u2019s made with recycled materials and has a woodgrain surface with carved-out details that not only make it functional but also helps enhance your home\u2019s aesthetic. And if you\u2019re worried about measurements, the door is available in a wide variety of options that range between 18-inch by 80-inch and 36-inch by 78-inch sizes.\n\n",

(NYSE:HD) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the largest home improvement specialty retailers in the world. The company engages in the sale of building materials and home improvement equipment. The company has more than 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nIn 2025, real estate experts expect a rise in housing inventory driven by higher demand due to lower interest rates compared to 2024. Over the past year, HD shares registered a modest gain of over 15%. This year with a higher demand expected in the housing market, Home Depot can gain on that momentum. Surprisingly, Hurricanes Helene and Milton have unlocked additional demand for the firm.\n\nThe home improvement industry is vast and fragmented, valued at more than $1 trillion annually. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) being one of the largest players in the sector, only grasps 15% market share. This reflects Home Depot\u2019s potential to capture a wider market. Moreover, the company\u2019s operating cash flow sits at more than $15 billion, as of Q3 2024, which adds to the company\u2019s ability to invest and expand.\n\nCore inflation has cooled to 3.2% yearly growth, while economists projected 3.3% annual growth. The slowing inflation helps HD because it allows consumers certain relief from higher prices. In 2025, total year-on-year CPI and consumer inflation rates are expected to fall below the Fed\u2019s 2% target, which would be great for HD.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 11th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of HD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you're ever involved in a car crash, here's what you should do.\n\nA 24-year-old Los Angeles County man allegedly trying to evade arrest Friday in Camarillo led authorities on a veritable miles-long demolition derby that ended in a three-vehicle crash on Santa Rosa Road.\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Capt. Ken Truitt said Camarillo officers responded to a theft call around 3:30 p.m. at the Target on Ventura Boulevard and found the suspect's vehicle at the nearby Home Depot. Camarillo contracts its police services with the sheriff's office.\n\nTruitt said the man, driving away in his car, rammed two responding sheriff's patrol vehicles and two more cars in the parking lot before getting away.\n\nThe man drove onto southbound Highway 101 with officers giving chase. The pursuit ended at Santa Rosa and Hill Canyon roads after the suspect struck two more vehicles.\n\nTruitt said two people were in each of the other two vehicles and suffered a range of injuries from minor to moderate. None of the injuries was considered life threatening, he said.\n\nSanta Rosa Road, between Moorpark and Upland roads, was closed for a time for the crash and investigation.\n\nTruitt said the man was taken into custody at the final crash scene. The suspect was to be checked at the hospital and ultimately, booked into Ventura County jail.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the man was accused of taking from Target.\n\nThe 24-year-old is facing multiple offenses Friday, including felony evading of an officer, hit and run and assault with deadly weapon on an officer, Truitt said.\n\nThe suspect is also believed to have two warrants for his arrest from Los Angeles County, one for robbery and one for homicide, the sheriff's captain said.",

            "content": "While clothes dryers are typically sold with accompanying washers, there\u2019s no rule saying you have to buy them that way. For those of us with laundry machines hidden away in garages or basements, a matching pair isn't that important. You can just pick your favorite of each.\n\nOver the years, hundreds of dryers have passed through our labs, and we test them from every angle. The chief concern: Can the dryer get clothes dry in a timely manner without damaging them? Next, we test extra features like steam or smart connectivity. Finally, we analyze the fit and finish. The very best dryers have sturdy doors, drum lights, and easy-to-read buttons.\n\nWe looked over the data of every dryer we've tested and found the best of the best. Among those, the Electrolux ELFE7637AT (available at Home Depot) (available at Abt for $949.00) tops our list with excellent performance and a number of features that make laundry day easier.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Beckett Dubay\n\nBest Dryer Electrolux ELFE7637AT Dimensions: 38\" x 27\u201d x 32\" (H x W x D)\n\n38\" x 27\u201d x 32\" (H x W x D) Capacity: 8 cubic feet\n\n8 cubic feet Finishes: Titanium, white\n\nTitanium, white Special features: Extended tumble mode, steam features, predictive drying\n\nExtended tumble mode, steam features, predictive drying Matching washer: Electrolux ELFW7637AT\n\nElectrolux ELFW7637AT Energy Star rated:Yes The Electrolux ELFE7637AT excels at just about everything. On our drying tests, its Normal cycle shined by completely drying our test load of laundry in just 90 minutes. Its Bulky and Delicates cycles were also able to remove a great deal of water in a relatively short amount of time. While its quick cycle didn't have the highest performance of the bunch, as a blazingly-fast 15-minute cycle, it still has its uses apart from raw water removal. It isn't just impressive performance: This dryer also comes packed with some incredibly useful features. The steam features also help put it over the top, allowing for dewrinkling and static reduction modes as well as quick refreshes. Its predictive drying helps the machine make better cycle time estimates and can reduce wear and tear damage from over-drying. And it manages to do all this while still keeping its energy consumption low enough to garner an Energy Star certification. While this dryer is on the more expensive side, you're paying a premium price for a premium product. This Electrolux is one of the best dryers we've had come through our labs.

This appropriately-priced mid-range option has all the features you want and some you didn\u2019t know you needed. It boasts simple controls and a solid drying performance. Its drying performance is especially strong for its price point, on most cycles. Its Regular cycle finished faster than the average\u201464 minutes vs. 71\u2014and got our test load of laundry 100% dry each time. You'll also love its smart features, which include notifications when you need to adjust a load to ensure proper drying. Nobody likes finding out their comforter or sheets balled up and insulated a bunch of damp laundry from drying properly.

This compact ventless unit is perfect for smaller spaces or apartments that lack a proper water inlet or exhaust vent, and can easily stack with its paired dryer or fit into a closet to save space. Like most compact dryers, this Beko does have long cycle times, but as long as you don't mind a wait this tiny dryer can offer some outsized performance. While all its cycles performed well, its Bulky cycle especially impressed with its ability to get a comforter completely dry. And it does all this using a small fraction of the electricity a standard dryer would need.

In terms of its core performance, the MED6230HW was able to finish cycles quickly and effectively. We only ran into a minor issue on Bulky Items, which didn't have the most effective spin cycle: Clothes were damper than average afterwards. In addition to excellent cleaning power, we love this dryer's design. Its hamper-style door, which can open either from top to bottom or left to right, can make loading and unloading a lot easier. This, coupled with its smart features and remote start, help make this one of the easier-to-use dryers we've reviewed, though it isn't explicitly ADA compliant.

Compact ventless dryers are a lot smaller than built-in models, which can be either a boon or a burden, depending on your laundry room. They're also much more expensive than vented models, so typically you should get a full-size, built-in model if you can accommodate one. For those that can't, the Miele TXR860WP Eco & Steam dryer provides a higher-end user experience than most other compact ventless dryers we've tested, proving itself capable of competing with full-size models. Its drying performance was better than most built-in models, and its cycle times were surprisingly fast as well. Its steam features really helped it clear away stubborn stains and can help sanitize items as well. We also liked its specialized cycle settings and low maximum temperature, both of which can help mitigate wear and tear damage on your laundry. This model is simple to install, and its smaller size makes it easy to move from room to room. Those shopping for a compact ventless dryer should definitely check out the TXR860WP Eco & Steam dryer.

We\u2019re not just talking about the available width in your laundry room, although that\u2019s definitely important.\n\nAre the doorways in your home wide enough for a dryer to fit through during delivery? Will narrow or tight staircases present a problem? Take a tape measure and check the doorway width against the dryer\u2019s specs, making sure you have a few inches of clearance.\n\nCapacity\n\nMost dryers have capacities ranging from 7.3 to 7.5 cubic feet, enough to deal with the laundry that can fit in most washing machines. However, if you have a high-capacity washing machine (5.0 cubic-foot capacity or greater), you\u2019ll need a dryer that can keep up with the bigger laundry loads, typically one with a capacity of 8.0 cubic-feet or greater. Otherwise, your dryer may struggle to dry large laundry loads in a single dryer cycle.\n\nPrice\n\nKeep your budget constraints in mind. Dryer prices can run the gamut from $500 to $2,000 or more, but most sit in the $800 to $1,200 range. We have recommendations for some dryers with very low prices, but you can generally find great dryers at any price point. It just takes a little research and figuring out which features and design elements you can live without.\n\nAlso, if you can afford to wait, most appliance manufacturers and retailers tend to offer steep discounts around major holidays. Vigilantly searching for deals can save you hundreds of dollars.\n\nCustomization/Extra Cycles\n\nHow picky are you about your dryer cycles? Do you want to be able to set specific cycle temperatures, drying levels, and cycle duration, or would you prefer to just hit two buttons and start drying? Do you want a cycle just for denim jeans?\n\nConsider how you do laundry on a day-to-day basis. If you prefer a straightforward process, you\u2019ll probably want to buy a lower-tech dryer. Even if extra customization seems appealing, it may not make sense for you to buy a dryer loaded with features you won\u2019t really use.\n\nSteam\n\nAre you considering a dryer with steam? Steam is an easy and effective way to reduce wrinkles, remove stale smells, and refresh clothing.\n\nHowever, if the dryer you\u2019re eyeballing has steam, be sure to find out exactly how the dryer gets the water needed to create that steam. Most dryers will require access to an additional water line, but some dryers have a drawer where you can manually add water. If you don\u2019t have that necessary water hookup, you may pay extra for a feature you can\u2019t actually use.\n\nDoor\n\nBased on your laundry room configuration, which way should the dryer door open? If the opening direction doesn\u2019t work in your laundry space, don\u2019t worry, almost all dryers have reversible doors. All you\u2019ll need is a screwdriver and some elbow grease.\n\nIt\u2019s such a minor thing, it can be a big frustration when you use your shiny new dryer for the first time and learn you can\u2019t open the door all the way.\n\nHow We Tested the Best Dryers\n\nThe Tests\n\nEvery dryer that comes into Reviewed\u2019s labs gets put through the same testing regime, which addresses both performance and user-friendliness.\n\nWe've spent many years testing major appliances including washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and robot vacuum cleaners.\n\nWe have plenty of experience testing these products in the lab, but we've also used them like normal people would in the course of their daily lives, which means that we have a great sense of what appliances are bargains at their price points, and which appliances have genuinely useful extra features (as opposed to the kitchen-sink approach to features).\n\nDryer performance tests include:\n\n\u2022 Drying performance \u2013 How much water does each major dryer cycle actually remove from your clothes, and how quickly can it achieve that level of dryness?\n\n\u2022 Maximum temperature \u2013 We record the maximum temperature in each dryer cycle. Some like it hot, but if dryer temperatures get too hot, it could damage your clothes.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Timothy Renzi Most dryers have capacities ranging from 7.3 to 7.5 cubic feet, enough to deal with the laundry that can fit in most washing machines.\n\nThe best dryers completely dry your clothes at a temperature that is hot (140\u00b0F-150\u00b0F), but not too hot (lest your clothes be scorched or damaged), and have short cycle times.\n\nBeyond these performance tests, we also assess the usability of each dryer, based on our experience, both during testing and during more casual use (one perk of working at Reviewed is that there are plenty of laundry machines on the premises!). Our main goal is to discern: How easy is it to actually use this dryer? This involves cumulatively assessing the control panel, the door, the vent, and any smart features.\n\nBy combining the performance data with our own observations, we can make solid recommendations for any type of dryer at any price point.\n\nMore Articles You May Enjoy",

            "content": "Jacob Nielson, Daily Herald\n\nA trademark dispute between Lehi-based Purple Mattress and a competing company over the use of the color purple has made its way to federal court.\n\nMattress competitor American Serleep Inc. filed a complaint against Purple Innovation Inc. on Jan. 13 at a U.S. District Court in South Carolina seeking a declaratory judgement of non-infringement so it can continue selling mattresses it argues have \u201cplum-colored elements.\u201d\n\nThe suit comes after Purple, which owns trademark registrations for the color purple for mattresses and seat cushions, allegedly contacted Home Depot to inform the retailer that products Serleep sold at Home Depot were violating Purple\u2019s trademark rights.\n\nAccording to court documents, Serleep was informed by Home Depot on July 24, 2024, that Purple Innovation Inc. made the trademark infringement allegations, saying Serleep\u2019s use of the color purple for \u201cseveral of its SERSPER brand products infringes on Purple\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nOne product in question is a SERSPER brand mattress.\n\nCourtesy image\n\nSerleep contends it did not violate the two trademark registrations Purple claimed it infringed upon, arguing the \u2018289 and \u2018468 registrations did not \u201cinclude a presumption that the Asserted Trade Dress has acquired distinctiveness,\u201d and claims Purple\u2019s \u2018468 registration was canceled Nov. 22, 2024, for failure to timely file a renewal.\n\nCourt documents further state allegations made by Purple could result in a \u201cpotential removal of Plaintiff\u2019s products from Home Depot\u2019s sales channels\u201d and could cause \u201csignificant financial harm\u201d to Serleep.\n\nPurple did not respond to the Daily Herald\u2019s request for comment.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark attorney and founder of trademark law firm Gerben IP, believes it is undisputed Purple has trademark rights to the word purple, but said extending those rights to the color itself presents challenges.\n\n\u201cPurple does have a registration for ancillary products to mattresses. They try to make this claim,\u201d said Gerben, who has no involvement in the case. \u201cTrademark law has really specific rules about claiming colors as trademarks. It\u2019s actually very hard to get rights around a particular color, mainly because there\u2019s only so many colors. And if you\u2019re going to take the ability of someone to use a color away on a particular product, it has to be very specific.\n\n\u201cSerleep is saying, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t own the color purple in any shade for mattresses. You just don\u2019t have that kind of market penetration, and you don\u2019t have those kinds of rights,'\u201d Gerben added.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Utah natives Tony and Terry Pearce, Purple Innovation Inc. is a publicly traded company with a market cap of over $109 million.\n\nPurple states on its website patents and trademarks are an important part of the company, and it says it owns several dozen patents and trademarks for its products, which include mattresses, pillows, bed frames, cushions and more.\n\nHouston Bragg, an attorney representing Serleep, estimated summons for the case will be issued within the next 30 days; Purple will then be given time to respond.",

            "content": "The Levoit Sprout is the company\u2019s first evaporative model that we\u2019ve tested, and we appreciated that nearly every part is dishwasher-safe (with the exception of the fan enclosure, which has electrical components). Unfortunately, it costs $190, and it left a roughly 10% difference in the relative humidity level across the room\u2014a result made more frustrating by the fact that it comes with a surprisingly accurate remote hygrometer.\n\nBy contrast, the Aircare Mantra ME440DGRY8 was much better at distributing the air around the room, but its onboard hygrometer was off by roughly 7% at any given time. Otherwise, this model was fine, but it\u2019s still too expensive to recommend.\n\nThe 6-liter Dreo HM713S is remarkably similar to our top pick, all the way down to the tank design and warm-mist capabilities. It performed decently in our tests, too, but it just didn\u2019t feel as nice as the Levoit models. The same goes for the slightly smaller Dreo HM512S.\n\nWe used to recommend the Vornado EVDC300, which provided great circulation along with all the other standard Vornado perks. But it wasn\u2019t as easy to clean as the EV3, and some readers complained about a decorative light in the tank that wouldn\u2019t turn off.\n\nThe Levoit OasisMist 450S Humidifier worked well enough but didn\u2019t offer anything to set it apart from our other Levoit picks.\n\nThe Carepod One is simple and sleek, and it\u2019s absolutely the easiest humidifier to clean of those we\u2019ve tested. Some manufacturing issues with the oscillation wand prevented us from making this model a pick in the past\u2014but even if that weren\u2019t a problem, this model would still be far too expensive.\n\nThe Canopy Bedside Humidifier is an attractive model with a lot of thoughtful design choices, all the way down to the packaging. But none of that can justify the hefty price tag, especially since the too-small tank has a too-small opening that makes it too hard to clean.\n\nThe Clorox Ultra Clean comes with a built-in UV light to help reduce any microbial growth that might pop up in the water, along with a three-year warranty. Unfortunately, in our tests it was only mediocre at the humidifying part of the job.\n\nThe Safety 1st Stay Clean Humidifier is another UV-equipped model, with just a single, simple-to-use dial to control the humidification level. But it offered lackluster performance in our tests.\n\nThe Dreo HM524S is a slightly larger version of our budget pick. It performed pretty well in our tests, but otherwise it failed to stand out beyond having an accurate on-board humidistat (a surprisingly rare occurrence).\n\nThe Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde PH04 performed decently as both a humidifier and an air purifier but not well enough to outshine our other picks, let alone to justify its massive cost (or size). We did appreciate its self-cleaning water tank, however.\n\nThe 1.5-gallon tank on the towering PureGuardian H3200WAR has two separate openings\u2014supposedly making it easier to fill in different-size sinks. Unfortunately, the tank doesn\u2019t sit flat either way, and neither fill hole is large enough to fit a hand through for cleaning.\n\nThe SPT SU-9210 Digital Evaporative Humidifier was our runner-up pick for many years, thanks to its reliably quiet evaporative performance. We still think it\u2019s a decent choice\u2014if you can find it in stock somewhere.\n\nThe top-filling Midea SCK-3Q60B has one of the worst on-board humidistats of all the models we\u2019ve tested. For some indiscernible reason, it also took a full minute to start up after we hit the power button.\n\nThe towering 10-liter Levoit OasisMist 1000S was the first Levoit model to really disappoint us. It was barely able to move the humidity more than 3 feet, leaving it to sit there in a puddle of its own making.\n\nThe fill hole on the Vicks V3900 is much too small for anyone to scrub the inside of the tank. It also might be too small for some people to get their hand back out after trying (which is how I ended up smashing it against the support beams in my kitchen to escape).\n\nThe Vicks VUL600 performed decently in our tests, but the tank was only slightly less frustrating than that of the V3900. At least I didn\u2019t have to smash this one. I just couldn\u2019t clean it, either.\n\nThe Carepod Cube X50 offers all the same perks and flaws as the original Carepod, with the bonus of warm-mist capability. Unfortunately, that feature doesn\u2019t actually do anything. After running for four hours on high during our testing, this humidifier raised the temperature of the water vapor by just 1 degree while consuming four times the energy.\n\nThe Elechomes UC5501 is a smart ultrasonic model that looks nearly identical to our top pick, the Levoit LV600S. Unfortunately, looks aren\u2019t everything, especially since this model has one of the worst humidistats and one of the slowest fans of any machine we\u2019ve tested.\n\nThe Lasko UH300 Quiet Ultrasonic is fine overall, though not particularly good in any way. It (over-)humidified the room a little faster than any of our Levoit picks. But the humidistat was about 10% off, and the fill hole on the 5-liter tank was too small for even my toddler to fit his hand inside. Pass.\n\nAlthough the Honeywell HUL430X is a streamlined and stylish-looking ultrasonic humidifier, it\u2019s frustratingly difficult to regulate or clean. It also has a tank that\u2019s sort of like a USB plug, in that no matter what you do, you always end up putting it in the wrong way the first time you try.\n\nThe Dyson Purifier PH03 Humidify+Cool is both a humidifier and an air purifier, and it performed well enough in our tests. But honestly, you\u2019re better off buying one of our humidifier picks, plus a separate air purifier; they would do both jobs better and still save you money.\n\nThe Vornado UH100 performed just as well as the models we like from Vornado. It was also the loudest ultrasonic model we tested, however, and it lacks the large capacity, the self-regulation, and the warm-mist capabilities that make the larger UH200 so appealing.\n\nA former budget pick, the Vicks V750 simply feels cheap in every sense of the word. On the plus side, it will continue working even after you accidentally snap a good number of the pieces in half during the cleaning process.\n\nThe Honeywell HCM-710 looks like a plastic casserole dish with a fan on top. And it was somehow both the quietest evaporative model we tested on medium and the absolute loudest on high. Worse, it sounds as if someone is leaning over your shoulder from behind and gurgling water in your ear.\n\nThis article was edited by Harry Sawyers.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nGrowing its distribution capabilities, The Home Depot on Wednesday announced partnerships with DoorDash and Uber Eats to offer on-demand and scheduled deliveries to customer houses and work sites.\n\nThrough the partnerships, Home Depot customers can have products delivered on demand, including gardening supplies, building materials, tools and other essentials. The retailer has more than 2,000 locations nationwide.\n\nShoppers can also track their purchases from their local retailer to their door with the Uber Eats app, per the Uber Eats press release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBoth DoorDash and Uber Eats have been diversifying their offerings in recent years to move beyond the food space. As of 2024, DoorDash says it has amassed more than 115,000 retailers on its platform in spaces like apparel, beauty, home improvement, arts and crafts, and other categories.\n\nWhether DoorDash, Uber Eats or other services, more retailers are relying on on-demand and same-day delivery platforms. Last June, Home Depot enlisted Instacart\u2019s Big & Bulky services for same-day and scheduled deliveries of items weighing up to 60 pounds. Similarly, Lowe\u2019s turned to DoorDash for its same-day delivery services last April.\n\n\u201cCombining DoorDash\u2019s fast and convenient platform with The Home Depot\u2019s existing same-day and next-day delivery options, homedepot.com offers our customers even more flexibility and convenience to shop in the way that best suits their needs,\u201d Jordan Broggi, executive vice president of customer experience and president of online at The Home Depot, said in a statement. \u201cThis is one of the many ways we\u2019re expanding our digital capabilities to create a seamless, interconnected shopping experience.\u201d\n\nIn addition to tapping same-day delivery companies for everyday customers, Home Depot has also introduced another option for professionals. Last March, the company launched a delivery service for its professional customers that will ship goods directly from its distribution centers to their job sites.\n\nDespite elevated housing costs and mortgage rates, Home Depot recently saw a boost in its earnings results. In Q3, the company\u2019s net sales increased 6.6% year over year to $40.2 billion, and its gross profit rose 5.4% to $13.4 billion.",

Yes, both cards have a $0 annual fee and offer an extended 365-day return period, as well as six months of deferred-interest financing for purchases of $299 or more. They're also both \"closed-loop\" cards that can be used only within the brand.\n\nBut the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card offers something The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card can\u2019t touch: an everyday, uncapped 5% discount at Lowe\u2019s on eligible purchases.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\nThe cards, side by side\n\nHere's how the two cards stack up on the basics:\n\nAt a glance MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card Read review The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card Read review Rates & Fees Annual fee $0 $0 Introductory offer Offers vary, but as of this writing: When you're approved, you'll receive a one-time coupon good for 20% off your first eligible purchase (maximum savings: $100). This offer is good through Jan. 31, 2024. Offers vary, but as of this writing: When you're approved, you'll receive a one-time coupon good for $25 off a purchase of $25 to $299; $50 off a purchase of $300 to $999; or $100 off purchases of $1,000 or more. Coupon must be used within 30 days of card approval. This offer is good through Jan. 24, 2024. Ongoing rewards 5% discount at Lowe's on all eligible purchases, applied instantly when you pay with your card at checkout. None. Financing options 6 months of deferred-interest financing on purchases of $299 or more, OR 84 fixed monthly payments at 9.99% APR on purchases of $2,000 or more. (Financing offers cannot be combined with the 5% everyday discount). 6 months of deferred-interest financing on purchases of $299 or more.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip As of this writing, the ongoing APR for both cards could range as high as 27% to 29%, so neither is ideal for carrying a balance. Also note that for both cards, the promotional \"no interest\" offers are not true 0% APR offers, where interest is waived, but rather deferred-interest offers, where interest is still being calculated in the background from the moment of each purchase you make. If the promotional period ends and you have a $0 balance (paid in full), you won't be charged interest. However, if at that time you owe any money (even 50 cents), you'll be charged interest on the full amount of the purchase, retroactive to the day you bought it.\n\nWhy the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card wins\n\nOngoing discount\n\nHome improvement projects can be pricey. But with the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card, cardholders can knock 5% off the cost of all eligible materials and supplies purchased from Lowe's. The discount is applied directly at the register when you use your card, so no need to remember coupons or special codes.\n\nJust be aware of what purchases qualify. You won't get the discount if you opt for special financing or installment financing. It also won't stack with other coupons or discount programs (such as military, employee or \"low-price guarantee\"), and it doesn't apply to purchases of gift cards, extended protection plans, shipping, delivery and assembly fees, or taxes.\n\nDespite those limitations, 5% back can lead to significant savings on project expenses. The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card offers no such discount, making the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card the clear-cut winner here.\n\nStraightforward sign-up bonus\n\nIf you like immediate gratification, the instant sign-up bonus offered with the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card might be for you. Upon approval, you'll receive a coupon good for 20% off your first purchase of up to $500 (maximum savings: $100). The offer is available through Jan. 31, 2024. That 20% discount could be a huge boon to your wallet on big expenses like a new appliance or flooring. Note that the sign-up bonus won't stack with the ongoing 5% back when using your card at Lowe's.\n\nThe Home Depot Consumer Credit Card also offers an initial one-time discount upon card approval, but the bonus structure is tiered and less rewarding relative to how much you need to spend to maximize the bonus. You'll earn $25 off purchases of $25 to $299, $50 off purchases of $300 to $999, or $100 off purchases of $1,000 or more.\n\nSimilar exclusions apply to the introductory offers on both cards; the discount can't be used on gift cards, certain brands, taxes and fees, or services. Despite these exclusions, the simplicity of an immediate 20% off gives the edge to the MyLowe\u2019s Rewards Credit Card.\n\nWhy you might want The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card\n\nLarger footprint\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAs of the end of 2022, The Home Depot had about 250 more stores than Lowe's across the United States. Depending on your location, that bigger geographic footprint means you might have a better chance of walking into a Home Depot. And if you're looking exclusively for a deferred-interest financing offer, that may push you toward The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card.\n\nHowever, even if there are no Lowe's stores near you, you'd be better off seeing if you qualify for a credit card that offers a true 0% introductory offer. The Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is one alternative. You'll get a 0% intro APR on Purchases for 12 months and 0% intro APR on Balance Transfers 12 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR. You'll also earn 2% cash rewards on all purchases, and new cardholders can qualify for the following sign-up bonus: Earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Let us know!\n\nThis story was supported by a statehouse coverage grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\nCerron Cade, the former state budget director whose appointment as Wilmington Mayor John Carney\u2019s chief of staff has been in jeopardy since his arrest last month on multiple shoplifting charges, resolved his criminal case in court Wednesday.\n\nCade, 41, admitted to one count of stealing merchandise from the Wilmington Home Depot store while accepting a plea of probation before judgment in Delaware\u2019s Court of Common Pleas.\n\nHe was put on low-level probation for a year and ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation and any recommended treatment, and repay Home Depot $394.32 \u2014 the cost of the items taken. Once he completes that sentence, the other five shoplifting counts will be dropped. The thefts occurred over a 3 \u00bd-month period ending in October.\n\nAccording to Attorney General Kathy Jennings\u2019 office and Cade\u2019s attorney Thomas Foley, such a deal is commonplace for first-time offenders charged with low-level misdemeanor crimes. Should Cade fulfill the terms of the plea, no conviction will appear on his record and he can seek an expungement, Foley said.\n\nAfter the 20-minute plea hearing, Cade said he had no comment.\n\nCade\u2019s arrest led Carney, who was governor at the time, to suspend him with pay. Carney, who was elected mayor of Delaware\u2019s largest city in November, had already named Cade chief of staff in charge of all city departments, including the police force.\n\nBut after the arrest of his \u201ctrusted adviser,\u2019\u2019 who was also state labor secretary during Carney\u2019s eight years as governor, Carney said he would wait \u201cuntil the matter is resolved\u2019\u2019 to decide whether to have Cade assume the Wilmington post.\n\nMayoral spokesman John Rago said Cade would \u201cstep into the chief of staff position as soon as he completes the requirements of the court.\u201d The post pays $181,000 annually.\n\nRago also issued this statement from Carney, who took office Jan. 7:\n\n\u201cCerron has been a valued colleague for more than 10 years during which time I have relied heavily on his strong government knowledge and management skills. I am looking forward to Cerron working with me in the new city administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, the virtues of trust and integrity are critical to our roles as public servants. Cerron has owned up to his mistakes and is being held accountable. He has my complete trust and confidence as we move forward in managing city government.\u201d\n\nPolice said Cade engaged in \u2018skip scanning\u2019 six times\u2019\n\nState police have said in court documents that Cade, whose salary as budget director was $164,000, engaged in a practice known as \u201cskip scanning\u2019\u2019 when using the Home Depot\u2019s self-checkout registers. That means Cade didn\u2019t scan one or one or more items on each of the six incidents outlined in the arrest warrant. The items Cade stole were for gardening, patio and other home uses.\n\nOn one occasion, Cade was observed putting an item he allegedly stole \u2014 a $75 animal cage trap \u2014 inside a planter he bought, the arrest warrant said.\n\nOn another occasion, he put an $11 battery-operated candle inside a $40 patio lantern, and stole them both, the warrant said.\n\nCade, who stands 6 feet, 6 inches tall, usually drove his gray 2019 Chevrolet Traverse SUV to the store on Miller Road, the warrant said. His arrival, departure and movements inside the cavernous Home Depot were captured on store surveillance cameras, the warrant said.\n\nPolice charged him with six counts of shoplifting under $1,500, a Class A misdemeanor punishable up to one year in prison and up to $2,300 in fines. Convictions to such misdemeanors generally result in low-level probation under the state\u2019s sentencing guidelines.\n\n\u2018I am sorry to see you and a little disappointed, frankly\u2019\n\nThe case was adjudicated before Judge Carl Danberg, the state\u2019s former attorney general and prisons commissioner.\n\nDanberg told the courtroom, which was filled with other defendants awaiting their hearings, that he knows Cade casually from their roles in state government and asked Foley and prosecutor Marc Petrucci if they thought he had a conflict in presiding over the case. Both lawyers said they had no objections, so Danberg proceeded with the plea hearing.",

(HD) is a home improvement retailer that sells various building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and d\u00e9cor products, as well as facilities maintenance, repair, and operations products. Valued at a market cap of $406.7 billion, the company is expected to announce its fiscal Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Tuesday, Feb. 25.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts project the home improvement company to report a profit of $3.01 per share, up 6.7% from $2.82 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has a solid track record of consistently beating Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in the last four quarters. In Q3, HD\u2019s earnings of $3.78 per share outpaced the Wall Street estimates by a margin of 3.9%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect HD to report an EPS of $15.12, marginally up from a profit of $15.11 in fiscal 2023.\n\nShares of HD have soared 15.1% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 26.5% rise and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLY) 33.1% return over the same time frame.\n\nOn Jan. 15, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December was reported to be lower than expected. As declining inflation is beneficial to the economy and offers consumers some relief from higher prices, Home Depot's stock increased by 3.4% on this news. However, on Nov. 12, shares of HD plunged 1.3% after its Q3 earnings release despite delivering better-than-expected Q3 adjusted earnings of $3.78 and revenues of $40.2 billion.\n\nMoreover, noting its Q3 performance, the company raised its full-year 2024 sales growth guidance to 4%. However, a 1.3% decline in comparable sales and a 9.2% year-over-year rise in operating expenses that led to a drop in both gross and adjusted operating profit margin might have overshadowed the positives and lowered investor confidence. Adjusted EPS was also down 1.8% from the year-ago quarter, adding to the downtrend.\n\nYet, Wall Street analysts are strongly optimistic about Home Depot\u2019s stock, with a \"Strong Buy\" rating overall. Among 36 analysts covering the stock, 26 recommend \"Strong Buy,\" one suggests a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d eight recommend \u201cHold,\u201d and one indicates a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating. This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with 25 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nThe average price target for HD is $435.32, which indicates a modest 6.3% potential upside from the current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some neighbors said they will dispatch their children to shop for groceries and run errands, so they can mostly stay inside the house.\n\n\u201cI plan to just stay very local, no unnecessary trips, and thank God my work is close to my house,\u201d said Frank, who is a restaurant cook and came to this country without federal authorization from El Salvador about 20 years ago.\n\nKathleen, his wife of seven years and a U.S. citizen, called the situation \u201cterrifying\u201d and said she was worried about him and \u201cwhat I would be left to deal with and having to take care of our kids on my own.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural speech, President Trump previewed a planned series of executive orders that he began rolling out later in the day. By Monday evening, he officially declared a national emergency at the southern border that \u201crequires use of the Armed Forces\u201d \u2014 a move for which he can expect to face legal hurdles.\n\n\u201cAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\u201d Trump continued in his inaugural address. His tally of noncitizens with criminal convictions is far higher than that reported by federal immigration authorities.\n\nThe Republican president also said he planned to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy in place during his first term, which forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings to present their immigration cases.\n\n\u201cI will end the practice of \u2018catch and release,\u2019 and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\u201d he continued.\n\nAs expected, he issued an executive order designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. \u201cAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks \u2026\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he signed yet another order to revoke birthright citizenship \u2014 the right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing citizenship to anyone born in the country or its territories regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status. Trump wants the Supreme Court to reinterpret the provision.\n\nEighteen states, including California, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts on Tuesday, challenging the order on grounds that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\u201cI am deeply disappointed that we\u2019re here, and also not at all surprised,\u201d said California Attorney General Rob Bonta at a news conference. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some theoretical legal disagreement. It would strip Americans of their most basic rights.\u201d\n\nBonta and the other attorneys general are asking the court for an immediate injunction to stop the order from taking effect on Feb. 19 while they litigate the case. Bonta acknowledged that the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs president of the United States, you have a lot of authority,\u201d Bonta said, \u201cbut it is not unlimited.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday Morry Gash / Associated Press )\n\nBy late afternoon Monday on the West Coast, several hundred protesters began marching from San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park to the Hall of Justice, chanting, \u201cWhen immigrant lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up fight back!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about migrant people because this will be really hard for the next four years. It was before too, when Trump had power the last time. It was really crazy for us right there on the border, and we expect the same thing right now or worse,\u201d said Alejandro Ortigoza, 50, the leader of Armadillos Busqueda y Rescate, a group that goes into the desert to search for the remains of missing migrants.\n\nYet even as the new president was declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, people whose lives straddle it mostly carried on with business as usual.\n\nLighter than normal foot traffic continued through the \u201cpedestrian east\u201d crossing at San Ysidro as people calmly headed for the trolley under the familiar noise of a helicopter circling above.\n\nIn the Home Depot parking lot in Imperial Beach, day laborers gathered as they usually do, seeking odd jobs helping San Diegans move or clean up their lawns. They said they cross the border every day from their homes in Tijuana and didn\u2019t expect Trump\u2019s executive orders would heavily affect them. Still, several planned to carry documents proving they are naturalized U.S. citizens everywhere they go.\n\nLeft: Workers wait for job opportunities in front of a Home Depot in San Diego on Monday.

Adriana Heldiz / CalMatters )\n\nSa\u00fal Mu\u00f1oz, a 53-year-old construction worker who lives in the Otay area of Tijuana, predicted an increase in human rights violations under Trump.\n\n\u201cIf they remove all the [people who are] undocumented, then yes, we\u2019re going to have more work, but they\u2019re going to want to pay the same as they did before, they\u2019re going to want to pay us less,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cSo, really, who is going to benefit?\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the Trump administration, we\u2019re going to see horrors in terms of the attacks that immigrant communities are going to suffer. President Trump will put 5.1 million U.S. citizen children at risk of family separation,\u201d said Kerri Talbot, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, a national pro-immigrant advocacy group based in D.C.\n\nThe most recent New York Times / Ipsos poll of Americans, conducted earlier in January, found that 55% either strongly or somewhat support mass deportations of people living in the United States without authorization.\n\nPublic support for deportation was even stronger in certain circumstances: 87% of those surveyed backed deporting those who are \u201chere illegally and have criminal records,\u201d and 63% backed removing those who are \u201chere illegally and arrived over the last four years.\u201d\n\nBut just 41% of those surveyed supported ending \u201cbirthright citizenship for children born to immigrants who are here illegally.\u201d And only 34% wanted to stop deportation protections for \u201cimmigrants who were children when they entered the country illegally.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s actions were telegraphed far in advance \u2014 on the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. By the end of last week, Trump\u2019s Incoming \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, was telling Fox News that large-scale raids are set to begin as soon as Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be big raids all across the country. Chicago is just one of many places,\u201d said Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \u201cOn Tuesday, you\u2019re going to expect ICE \u2026 ICE is finally going to go out and do their job. We\u2019re going to take the handcuffs off ICE and let them go arrest \u2018criminal aliens.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s plans are likely to encounter significant legal challenges and logistical obstacles, including the challenge of housing millions of detainees before they can be removed.\n\nThreatening to yank California\u2019s federal funds \u2014 again\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s immigration orders today also threatened to pull federal money from \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d that limit collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies.\n\nA third of California\u2019s budget relies on federal dollars.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds,\u201d one order states. \u201cFurther, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction\u2019s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\u201d\n\nThe returning president has long derided California for declaring itself a \u201csanctuary state\u201d for undocumented immigrants \u2013 a move the Democratic-controlled Legislature made during his first term \u2014 but the reality is more nuanced. Known here as the California Values Act, the law exempts from its protections people convicted of violent crimes or serious offenses such as felony drunk driving, for example, and allows California state prisons to regularly coordinate with ICE about upcoming release dates for prisoners eligible for deportation.\n\nCalifornia went to court during Trump\u2019s first term to beat back his intent to withhold a few federal grants from the state for its failure to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. In 2018, a federal judge ruled in the California\u2019s favor, saying the president\u2019s move was unconstitutional.\n\nIn December, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 to prohibit county agencies from using local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement, including cooperation with ICE. But San Diego County Sheriff Kelly Martinez said she will not comply with the county\u2019s new policy, saying the county board does not set policy for her department.\n\nPeople seeking asylum are detained after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images )\n\nDays before Christmas, a conservative organization led by Trump adviser Stephen Miller sent letters to California leaders and former San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas warning they could go to prison over sanctuary policies that protect undocumented residents.\n\nHoman has said he plans to target not just people with criminal records but anyone who may be nearby.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to concentrate on the worst first, public safety threats first. But no one\u2019s off the table. If they\u2019re in the country illegally, they\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Homan said on Fox News this weekend.\n\nIn San Diego, local organizations have been holding private \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d events in the months since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nGina Amato Lough, the directing attorney for Public Counsel\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project in Los Angeles, stressed that constitutional rights apply to everyone, whether they are in the country legally or not.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s really important for people to exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at home and ICE shows up at your door, you don\u2019t have to open the door.\u201d\n\nIn another case among the exhaustive list of California legal challenges to the first Trump administration, the University of California in 2020 prevailed in a suit that preserved the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The program\u2019s purpose: to shield from deportation immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders are expected to have financial and economic impacts, costing billions of dollars and disrupting local communities while doing little to address real immigration challenges, advocates warned. Advocates and academics cautioned Trump\u2019s pledged policies will ultimately weaken the country by undermining the contributions of immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cEconomically, the entire country is going to be deeply affected negatively,\u201d said Cecilia Menj\u00edvar, a professor of sociology at UCLA. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important to recognize that it\u2019s not only undocumented immigrants we\u2019re talking about. Lawful permanent residents, naturalized citizens, all immigrant labor, all immigrants, all foreign-born, contribute vitally to critical sectors of the entire economy of the country: health, services, hospitality, care for children, care for the elderly, high tech, you name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, for California, recovery from disasters: It\u2019s immigrants who clean up and rebuild,\u201d Menj\u00edvar added.\n\nThe California Welcoming Task Force, a binational coalition of immigration organizations active in the border region, estimated the removal of 7 million to 8 million undocumented workers in the U.S. would exacerbate already-worsening labor shortages.\n\nPeople wait outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego on Jan. 20, 2025. Adriana Heldiz / CalMatters )\n\n\u201cThe impact on numerous industries, such as construction, agriculture, healthcare and hospitality, would be catastrophic,\u201d the group wrote in an email. \u201cA deportation effort of this scale would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars in California alone, with millions more spent annually to fund immoral and unsafe detention camps.\u201d\n\nSouth of the border\n\nAt a protest in the Mexican city of Tijuana on Sunday, activists hung anti-Trump signs and a Trump pi\u00f1ata along the border wall at Playas de Tijuana. Earlier, students from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California of Ensenada painted hearts and messages of love and acceptance on the steel bollards of the border wall.\n\nTrump ended the Biden administration\u2019s CBP One, a mobile application that allows migrants outside the U.S. to request an asylum appointment at a port of entry. CBS News reported about 270,000 migrants were waiting in northern Mexico, hoping to get an appointment or make their appointment before Trump cancels the program.\n\nCutting off their legal pathway may lead to an increase in irregular crossings, border experts warned. During the last Trump administration, makeshift encampments formed along the border as migrants waiting to cross into the United States became increasingly desperate, lacking food, water, shelter and being targeted by criminal groups in northern Mexico. That led to an increase in people making more desperate attempts to cross the border in more dangerous ways.\n\nNigel Duara of CalMatters contributed to this article.\n\n",

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Pano has developed a connected, intelligent platform for fire professionals that helps them detect threats, confirm fires, and disseminate information to responders, faster than ever before.\n\nThe company speeds response time by empowering detection specialists with enhanced visual equipment and rapid data analysis supported by AI.\n\nSpecialists have a single, unified view combining ultra-high-definition cameras, geo satellite data, field sensors, legacy cameras, emergency alerts, and other data feeds. They also have the ability to share everything in real-time with their extended team. Altogether, this makes it possible to quickly identify and contain wildfires.\n\nFire Investing: Be Prepared!\n\nMaybe because I was once a boyscout, but I truly believe it makes far more sense to be prepared than to wait until the damage is done, and then rebuild. And then, of course, wait for the next natural disaster to do the same thing.\n\nUnfortunately, Pano is not a public company. But I do believe that we will start to see more of these types of \u201cpreparedness\u201d companies go public in the coming years. Particularly as the world is forced to adapt to an increase in extreme weather events across the globe.\n\nOf course, there are other ways to profit from preparedness. Ways that have nothing to do with natural disasters. Like AI for instance. An industry that is preparing for a massive increase in growth. Growth that can only be facilitated by securing more energy supplies.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular reader of these pages, you know that the rapid development of the AI industry is instigating a bull market in energy. In particular, energy companies that provide electricity solely to operate these AI data centers.\n\nLast year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced a deal to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power its data centers. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) signed a contract with Kairos Power to develop a fleet of SMRs to power its data centers.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, data center operator Switch inked a deal with Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) to deploy 12 GW of SMR projects.\n\nIndeed, we will see more of these deals in 2025 as the world\u2019s biggest tech giants race to secure enough power to meet demand for AI applications. And while these data centers can be powered with anything from natural gas to solar, the advantage of SMRs is their siting flexibility. These things can be built practically anywhere and without the need for a large, established infrastructure. As well, they\u2019re far cheaper and faster to build than traditional power plants.\n\nSo clearly, we\u2019re taking full advantage by loading up on shares of an SMR company that insiders are now calling the AI Master Key. This, because the AI Master Key is the link between escalating power needs from AI data centers and the cheap energy required to power them.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this is going to be a home run for us in 2025. Which is why our Energy & Capital research team put together this short report which explains exactly how the AI Master Key works. And of course, how you can start profiting from it right now.",

            "content": "In summary Along the California-Mexico border, immigrants at risk of deportation are seeking to live undetected through an unprecedented crackdown. But a returning President Trump issued a barrage of Inauguration Day executive orders designed to pull the military into border enforcement and punish states such as California for sanctuary policies. Court challenges are coming.\n\nLea esta historia en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nUndocumented immigrants and their California families braced for the worst \u2014 and many told CalMatters they would go underground \u2014 as newly sworn-in President Donald Trump began issuing executive orders to enable what he promises will be the most massive deportation in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s draining my energy a lot, thinking of what\u2019s going to happen and not knowing exactly what\u2019s going to happen with me and my family and my daughters,\u201d said Frank, a resident of northeastern Los Angeles who asked to be identified only by his first name because of his ongoing immigration case.\n\nAdvocates reported hearing from parents who were considering keeping their children home from school this week. Some neighbors said they will dispatch their children to shop for groceries and run errands, so they can mostly stay inside the house.\n\n\u201cI plan to just stay very local, no unnecessary trips, and thank God my work is close to my house,\u201d said Frank, who is a restaurant cook and came to this country without federal authorization from El Salvador about 20 years ago.\n\nKathleen, his wife of seven years and a U.S. citizen, called the situation \u201cterrifying\u201d and said she was worried about him and \u201cwhat I would be left to deal with and having to take care of our kids on my own.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural speech, President Trump previewed a planned series of executive orders that he began rolling out later in the day. This evening he officially declared a national emergency at the southern border that \u201crequires use of the Armed Forces\u201d \u2014 a move for which he can expect to face legal hurdles.\n\n\u201cAll illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\u201d Trump continued in his inaugural address, without providing details yet about how he could miraculously end all illegal entry. His tally of noncitizens with criminal convictions is far higher than that reported by federal immigration authorities.\n\nThe Republican president also said he planned to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy in place during his first term, which forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings to present their immigration cases.\n\n\u201cI will end the practice of \u2018catch and release,\u2019 and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\u201d he continued.\n\nAs expected, he issued an executive order designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. \u201cAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks \u2026\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he signed yet another order to revoke birthright citizenship \u2014 the right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing citizenship to anyone born in the country or its territories regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status. Trump wants the Supreme Court to reinterpret the provision.\n\nEighteen states, including California, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts Tuesday, challenging the order on grounds that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\u201cI am deeply disappointed that we\u2019re here, and also not at all surprised,\u201d said California Attorney General Rob Bonta at a press conference. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some theoretical legal disagreement. It would strip Americans of their most basic rights.\u201d\n\nBonta and the other attorneys general are asking the court for an immediate injunction to stop the order from taking effect on Feb. 19 while they litigate the case. Bonta acknowledged that the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs president of the United States, you have a lot of authority,\u201d Bonta said, \u201cbut it is not unlimited.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump holds the Bible during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, on Jan. 20, 2025. Photo by Morry Gash, AP Photo\n\nBy late afternoon Monday on the West Coast, several hundred protesters began marching from San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park to the Hall of Justice, chanting, \u201cWhen immigrant lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up fight back!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about migrant people because this will be really hard for the next four years. It was before too, when Trump had power the last time. It was really crazy for us right there on the border, and we expect the same thing right now or worse,\u201d said Alejandro Ortigoza, 50, the leader of Armadillos Busqueda y Rescate, a group that goes out into the desert to search for the remains of missing migrants.\n\nYet even as the new president was declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, people whose lives straddle it mostly carried on with business as usual.\n\nLighter than normal foot traffic continued through the \u201cpedestrian east\u201d crossing at San Ysidro as people calmly headed for the trolley under the familiar noise of a helicopter circling above.\n\n\u201cI think Trump is very racist\u2026.and he\u2019s not right in the head\u201d Juan, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Tijuana and crosses the border daily to work\n\nIn the Home Depot parking lot in Imperial Beach, day laborers gathered as they usually do, seeking odd jobs helping San Diegans move or clean up their lawns. They said they cross the border every day from their homes in Tijuana and didn\u2019t expect Trump\u2019s executive orders would heavily affect them. Still, several planned to carry documents proving they are naturalized U.S. citizens everywhere they go.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Juan, a 60-year-old from Sinaloa, Mexico, and a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Tijuana and crosses the border daily to work. \u201cIt\u2019s not convenient for the U.S., nor for Mexico, to close the border. It won\u2019t benefit either country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Trump is very racist\u2026.and he\u2019s not right in the head,\u201d he added.\n\nJuan declined to give his last name out of fear of retaliation or harassment for sharing his negative opinion about the president. He keeps proof of his legal status ready. \u201cI always bring my certification, saying I\u2019m naturalized everywhere I go. I have it in my backpack always.\u201d\n\nFirst: Workers wait for job opportunities in front of a Home Depot in San Diego on Jan. 20, 2025.

Photos by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters\n\nSa\u00fal Mu\u00f1oz, a 53-year-old construction worker who lives in the Otay area of Tijuana, predicted an increase in human rights violations under Trump.\n\n\u201cIf they remove all the (people who are) undocumented, then yes, we\u2019re going to have more work, but they\u2019re going to want to pay the same as they did before, they\u2019re going to want to pay us less,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cSo, really, who is going to benefit?\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the Trump administration, we\u2019re going to see horrors in terms of the attacks that immigrant communities are going to suffer. President Trump will put 5.1 million U.S. citizen children at risk of family separation,\u201d said Kerri Talbot, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, a national pro-immigrant advocacy group based in D.C.\n\nThe most recent New York Times / Ipsos poll of Americans, conducted earlier in January, found that 55% either strongly or somewhat support mass deportations of people living in the United States without authorization.\n\nPublic support for deportation was even stronger in certain circumstances: 87% of those surveyed backed deporting those who are \u201chere illegally and have criminal records,\u201d and 63% backed removing those who are \u201chere illegally and arrived over the last four years.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut just 41% of those surveyed supported ending \u201cbirthright citizenship for children born to immigrants who are here illegally.\u201d And only 34% wanted to stop deportation protections for \u201cimmigrants who were children when they entered the country illegally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to concentrate on the worst first, public safety threats first. But no one\u2019s off the table. If they\u2019re in the country illegally, they\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Trump border czar tom homan\n\nIt\u2019s not like Trump\u2019s actions today hadn\u2019t been telegraphed far in advance \u2014 on the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. By the end of last week, Trump\u2019s Incoming \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, was telling Fox News that large-scale raids are set to begin as soon as Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be big raids all across the country. Chicago is just one of many places,\u201d said Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \u201cOn Tuesday, you\u2019re going to expect ICE \u2026 ICE is finally going to go out and do their job. We\u2019re going to take the handcuffs off ICE and let them go arrest \u2018criminal aliens.\u2019 That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s plans are likely to encounter significant legal challenges and logistical obstacles, including the challenge of housing millions of detainees before they can be removed.\n\nThreatening to yank California\u2019s federal funds \u2014 again\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s immigration orders today also threatened to pull federal money from \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d that limit collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies.\n\nA third of California\u2019s budget relies on federal dollars.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the maximum extent possible under law, evaluate and undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds,\u201d one order states. \u201cFurther, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall evaluate and undertake any other lawful actions, criminal or civil, that they deem warranted based on any such jurisdiction\u2019s practices that interfere with the enforcement of Federal law.\u201d\n\nThe returning president has long derided California for declaring itself a \u201csanctuary state\u201d for undocumented immigrants \u2013 a move the Democratic-controlled Legislature made during his first term \u2014 but the reality is more nuanced. Known here as the California Values Act, the law exempts from its protections people convicted of violent crimes or serious offenses such as felony drunk driving, for example, and allows California state prisons to regularly coordinate with ICE about upcoming release dates for prisoners eligible for deportation.\n\nCalifornia went to court during Trump\u2019s first term to beat back his intent to withhold a few federal grants from the state for its failure to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. In 2018, a federal judge ruled in the California\u2019s favor, saying the president\u2019s move was unconstitutional.\n\nIn December, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted 3-1 to prohibit county agencies from using local resources to assist federal immigration enforcement, including cooperation with ICE. But San Diego County Sheriff Kelly Martinez said she will not comply with the county\u2019s new policy, saying the county board does not set policy for her department.\n\nPeople seeking asylum are detained by border patrol after crossing the US/Mexico border in Campo, on June 3, 2024. Photo by Robert Gauthier, Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nDays before Christmas, a conservative organization led by Trump adviser Stephen Miller sent letters to California leaders and former San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas warning they could go to prison over sanctuary policies that protect undocumented residents.\n\nHoman has said he plans to target not just people with criminal records but anyone who may be nearby.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to concentrate on the worst first, public safety threats first. But no one\u2019s off the table. If they\u2019re in the country illegally, they\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Homan said on Fox News this weekend.\n\nIn San Diego, local organizations have been holding private \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d events in the months since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nGina Amato Lough, the directing attorney for Public Counsel\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project in Los Angeles, stressed that constitutional rights apply to everyone, whether they are in the country legally or not.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s really important for people to exercise their constitutional rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at home and ICE shows up at your door, you don\u2019t have to open the door.\u201d\n\nIn another case among the exhaustive list of California legal challenges to the first Trump administration, the University of California in 2020 prevailed in a suit that preserved the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The program\u2019s purpose: to shield from deportation immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children.\n\nEconomic impact\n\nTrump\u2019s executive orders are expected to have financial and economic impacts, costing billions of dollars and disrupting local communities while doing little to address real immigration challenges, advocates warned. Advocates and academics cautioned Trump\u2019s pledged policies will ultimately weaken the country by undermining the contributions of immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cImportantly, for California, recovery from disasters: It\u2019s immigrants who clean up and rebuild.\u201d UCLA sociology professor Cecilia Menj\u00edvar\n\n\u201cEconomically, the entire country is going to be deeply affected negatively,\u201d said Cecilia Menj\u00edvar, a professor of sociology at UCLA. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important to recognize that it\u2019s not only undocumented immigrants we\u2019re talking about. Lawful permanent residents, naturalized citizens, all immigrant labor, all immigrants, all foreign-born, contribute vitally to critical sectors of the entire economy of the country: health, services, hospitality, care for children, care for the elderly, high tech, you name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, for California, recovery from disasters: It\u2019s immigrants who clean up and rebuild,\u201d Menj\u00edvar added.\n\nThe California Welcoming Task Force, a binational coalition of immigration organizations active in the border region, estimated the removal of 7 to 8 million undocumented workers in the U.S. would exacerbate already-worsening labor shortages.\n\nPeople wait outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego on Jan. 20, 2025. Photo by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters\n\n\u201cThe impact on numerous industries, such as construction, agriculture, healthcare and hospitality, would be catastrophic,\u201d the group wrote in an email today. \u201cA deportation effort of this scale would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars in California alone, with millions more spent annually to fund immoral and unsafe detention camps.\u201d\n\nOn the south side of the border\n\nAt a protest in the Mexican city of Tijuana on Sunday, activists hung anti-Trump signs and a Trump pi\u00f1ata along the border wall at Playas de Tijuana. Earlier, students from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California of Ensenada painted hearts and messages of love and acceptance on the steel bollards of the border wall.\n\nTrump ended the Biden administration\u2019s CBP One, a mobile application that allows migrants outside the U.S. to request an asylum appointment at a port of entry. CBS News reported about 270,000 migrants are waiting in northern Mexico, hoping to get an appointment or make their appointment before Trump cancels the program.\n\nCutting off their legal pathway may lead to an increase in irregular crossings, border experts warned. During the last Trump administration, makeshift encampments formed along the border as migrants waiting to cross into the United States became increasingly desperate, lacking food, water, shelter and being targeted by criminal groups in northern Mexico. That led to an increase in people making more desperate attempts to cross the border in more dangerous ways.\n\nNigel Duara contributed to this story.",

Realty Income: All the right features plus monthly payments\n\nRealty Income is a top dividend stock that has an excellent business, high yield, and growing dividend, and it also has the added perk of cutting a monthly check.\n\nIt's a real estate investment trust (REIT), a business structure for companies that own and lease out rental properties. Realty Income is one of the largest REITs in the world, with more than 15,000 properties that it leases mostly to retailers. Its top 20 tenants include brands like Walmart and CVS, chains that do well in most circumstances and can keep up their leases. Although it touts that as an obvious advantage, it has also expanded to other categories through recent acquisitions and contracts.\n\nIt made a recent deal with Wynn Resorts, and 14% of its properties are in the industrials category. However, retail accounts for nearly 80% of the total, with grocery and convenience stores accounting for almost 20%. In other words, it has a stable and growing business, which is important in a dividend stock.\n\nAnother reason to be confident about Realty Income's ability to pay and grow its dividend is its extensive track record. It has paid a dividend for 655 months consecutively, and raised it 128 times since going public in 1994.\n\nThe dividend yields 5.9% at the current price, or more than 4 times the S&P 500 average. It's an excellent dividend pick for just about any investor.\n\n2. Home Depot: The industry leader\n\nHome Depot is the largest home improvement chain in the world. It has 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and it's opening new ones, although at a slow pace. People always need home improvement products, providing organic growth opportunities for Home Depot all the time.\n\nThe company has been challenged by the pressured housing market, but when people aren't moving they also have home improvement needs, since they might need more home maintenance in their current digs. Sales increased 6.6% year over year in the 2024 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 27), but comps were down 1.3%. Operating margin and net income were both down from last year but beat expectations.\n\nHome Depot is constantly upgrading its platform and converting to a heftier omnichannel model to meet today's consumer needs. It recently unveiled a larger regional distribution network with 19 fulfillment centers across the country, and it can reach 90% of its customers with same- or next-day delivery. The company launched a marketing campaign to highlight its reach and is already seeing results in higher conversions and incremental sales.\n\nThe underlying strength of this business supports its excellent dividend. It yields 2.2% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average, and it has increased more than 280% over the past 10 years.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: The Dividend King\n\nCoca-Cola is the classic great dividend stock. It's a Dividend King, and the company has raised its dividend annually for the past 62 years, under all kinds of circumstances. It's totally committed to the dividend, and its payout ratio reached more than 100% early in the pandemic when sales plunged.\n\nIt's the largest all-beverage company in the world, and it reaches customers in 200 countries all over the world. It has pricing power in its loved brands, which is why Coca-Cola is so reliable for strong performance. It's the top worldwide brand in the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink category, and it has developed all kinds of packaging and pricing changes to entice its fans even in the inflationary climate. Revenue dropped 1% in the 2023 third quarter, but organic revenue was up 9%.\n\nCoca-Cola has opportunities in acquiring new brands and capturing greater market share, and it has organic growth potential in its diverse beverage categories that include sparkling drinks, dairy, juice, coffee, and more.\n\nThe dividend yields 3.1% at the current price, and it's an excellent choice for a reliable, high-yielding stock.",

Experts say the number one tip is knowing where your outside water main shut off is.\n\n\u201cThe outside main water shutoff is indicated by light blue cap and one of these keys that you can pick up at Lowe\u2019s or Home Depot, at about seven bucks. But with this key, if something does happen, you\u2019ll be able to easily put it on this valve and turn your water off,\u201d Anytime Plumbing plumber Illya Davis said.\n\nDavis says that 99% of the time, he experiences freezing pipes from the wind chill factor rather than the temperature.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you can, you need to be able to go into this crawlspace during the daylight time and then close this door or pull it shut behind you and then examine it around the whole crawl space to see if there\u2019s any light that\u2019s coming in. Any light that\u2019s coming in that\u2019s indicating that wind chill factor could be able to go through there,\u201d David said.\n\n\u201cMake sure that you go around and you close all of your crawl space vents,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAnytime Plumbing says it\u2019s important to take these precautions because freezing pipes can cost you big money. In Richmond, Davis says the average price is $320 dollars for the first break and another $180 for every additional one.\n\n\u201cCheck your siding, it goes around and see if it\u2019s any that\u2019s missing or it has big gaps in it. Those are areas where that windshield factor that could be able to come through,\u201d Davis\n\nDavis says any small gap can cause issues, so if you do have one, be sure close it up.\n\n\u201cJust make sure that there\u2019s no gap if you can\u2019t see it from the inside, a gap around that hose bib, the actual bib, the metal of the bib is thicker than the piping that\u2019s behind it. So, if there\u2019s a gap between there, make sure you put some caulking around that,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAfter you do all of those tips, Davis says make sure to open up your kitchen cabinets to allow warm air to get to the pipes.\n\nCopyright 2025 WWBT.

(NYSE:HD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the show by commenting on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. The CPI is an inflation measurement, and the data for December saw prices rise by 0.4% monthly and 2.9% yearly. The monthly figure was above economist expectations of 0.3% while the annual figure was in-line. Naturally, this would suggest positive market movement but the investor reaction was muted. Commenting on the reaction, Cramer shared: \u201cLook what can I say. People told me that, again and again, if it just came in in-line that would be bad. That turned out to be a great mis-judgement. An in-line number in an atmosphere where we felt that things are going to, that everything\u2019s going to go explode to the top and we\u2019re going to be seeing five percent on the ten-year and six percent on the thirty, all these crazy things. All of the table, at least for today.\u201d\n\nCramer added that market sentiment is at opposite ends when it comes to interest rates and earnings. This is because Investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to cut interest rates by much this year. According to him, \u201cWhen I look at this market. . . there was a tremendous amount of negativity about interest rates but positivity about earnings. If you take the negativity about interest rates off, you look at the earnings that we saw this morning, people are going to be pretty optimistic. And it might be sustainable throughout, I don\u2019t know, a little while. These are great numbers that we saw this morning.\u201d\n\nThe day had started with big banks releasing a set of earnings release that sent their stocks soaring. However, Cramer\u2019s co-host, David Faber, cautioned that when he previously appreciated positive bank earnings, the stocks ended up dipping in the aftermath. Cramer responded by agreeing with Faber\u2019s assessment and adding \u201cI think the difference might be that the tone of the comments at least from what I\u2019ve talked to the, from the CEOs, on the calls, will be a little more positive. For something that we, I think we all struggle to try to get a handle on which is this notion of animal spirits. [The] Notion of optimism.\u201d\n\nHe linked some of the optimism with the perception of the incoming administration being more friendly towards banks when it came to regulation. \u201cYou know, Carl, when you see CEOs, you try to figure out what\u2019s happening in the country since the election. And you hear people say listen it\u2019s a peaceful transition, you hear people say it\u2019s a much better environment for deals,\u201d Cramer commented. He added \u201cBut I come back and just say, what\u2019s really going on is a belief that it, when it comes to the banks, that there was some sort of tyrannical regime. . . If they are gone, then maybe there is a runway for more than just one quarter\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nThe change in government makes Cramer cautiously optimistic about the banking industry. According to him \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be too optimistic, ever, because the bank stocks have let us down by say ten thirty, eleven in the morning. But so far it\u2019s a different attitude is what I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d\n\nSince he was spending another day at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, when asked about some of his biggest takeaways from the event, Cramer responded:\n\n\u201cI would not want to be in the processed food business. I think that this is about, let\u2019s get diet and exercise. If that doesn\u2019t work, then let\u2019s go vaccine. And let\u2019s go inoculation. Diet and exercise being front and center to wean off what the packaged food people have done to our country. That\u2019s his [RFK Jr.] view. That\u2019s not necessarily my view. I think that these companies do, they do things that I didn\u2019t want my kids to be addicted to Cheerios. Well actually Froot Loops. But I think what\u2019s really going on David is it\u2019s the regime of what we can do for ourselves versus what happens if you can\u2019t kick obesity. What happens if you can\u2019t kick diabetes.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired recently.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the largest home improvement retailers in America. Over the past year, the stock has gained a modest 13% due to high interest rates making their mark on the home building market. For its fiscal year 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) expects comparable sales to drop by 2.5%, which is an improvement over the previous midpoint drop of 3.5%. Ironically, Hurricanes Helene and Milton have unlocked additional demand for the firm. Cramer\u2019s comments for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) revolved around a recent deal announcement (now rejected) in the home improvement industry suggesting that perhaps the stock was undervalued:\n\n\u201cWhat does this [QXO\u2019s $11 billion acquisition proposal of Beacon Roofing] say about Home Depot? \u201cThese companies may be undervalued, they\u2019re selling at very low multiples.\u201d\n\nOverall, HD ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops. While we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

One thing you might not have considered as a new homeowner is the sheer quantity of things you\u2019re going to need to deck out your place and get it just the way you want it.\n\n4 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns\n\nWhile you\u2019re bound to end up shopping in more than one place for what you need, here are some of the best stores to check out in 2025 \u2014 and a few offerings that might be worth your while.\n\nHome Depot\n\nHome Depot is located in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. They also have an online presence, so even if you don\u2019t live nearby, you can still shop for what you need from the comfort of your new home.\n\nNew homeowners can find everything from essential tools to appliances at Home Depot. Sometimes, such as around Black Friday and the end of the year, you can find great deals on the things you need, so keep an eye on those sales.\n\nHere are just a few ideas of what you could get at Home Depot:\n\nOnline, Home Depot also has an extensive list of DIY guides and projects for new homeowners looking to personalize their home or do some renovations around the place.\n\nCostco\n\nCostco isn\u2019t just the place to go for bulk groceries, though you might find yourself with a very empty kitchen and pantry to fill as a new homeowner. If you\u2019re planning to stock up in 2025, you\u2019re going to also want to grab a few other things, like power tools, cleaning supplies, furniture and electronics.\n\nHere are some top picks:\n\nYou can get all of these \u2014 and more \u2014 at Costco, but you\u2019ll need a membership first. Costco\u2019s membership fees increased slightly this year, so they\u2019re likely to remain steady in 2025. Right now, a standard membership costs $65 a year (as opposed to the original $60).\n\nLowe\u2019s\n\nLike Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s is located in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Both stores also have a lot to offer new homeowners, both now and in 2024.\n\nAt Lowe\u2019s, you can get home delivery and installation on things like large appliances and everyday household goods. You can also get old appliances, if any came with the house, hauled away for a fee.\n\nHere are just a few picks for new homeowners at Lowe\u2019s:\n\nWalmart\n\nAfter the holiday rush and spending come to an end, you might want to save a bit of money going into next year. That\u2019s where Walmart comes in. Whether you prefer shopping online or in person, you can grab quite a few things to get your home feeling comfortable (and well-equipped for anything you need).\n\nFrom outdoor equipment like lawnmowers to patio furniture to kitchen supplies, Walmart\u2019s got you covered. Here are a few ideas of what to get:\n\nBonus: Local Home Improvement and Local Furniture Stores\n\nNever underestimate the power of a good local home improvement or furniture store. Whether you\u2019re moving to a small, rural town or the big city, you\u2019re bound to find a few highly-rated stores near your new neighborhood. But be sure to shop around as sometimes the pricing can be higher or the selection more limited at family-owned places than what you\u2019d find at bigger stores.\n\nHere are a few tips to get you started:\n\nLook for discount retailers that sell furniture, mattresses and home appliances at a lower price\n\nDo an online search for local home improvement shops\n\nCheck the more recent customer reviews (within the past year or so, ideally) to see what people are saying about the store\u2019s quality of goods and customer service\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Prices are accurate as of Dec. 27, 2024, and are subject to change. Availability also may vary depending on location.",

            "content": "While Inauguration Day will be the focus for many on Monday, it also marks the observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday.\n\nThough King's birthday was on Jan. 15, the holiday honoring the civil rights icon is observed on the third Monday of every January.\n\nIt marks only the second time Inauguration Day and MLK Day will be observed on the same day, with the other being President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in January 1997.\n\nHere's an overview of what's open and closed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in and across Chicago.\n\nPublic Libraries\n\nMany public libraries across the state, including branches of the Chicago Public Library, are closed.\n\nMail Delivery\n\nIllinois post offices will be closed Monday. Because of that, there will not be any mail delivery or retail service on Jan. 20. All services will resume on January 21, according to the United States Postal Service.\n\n\"Customers requiring postal services can use the Self Service Kiosk (SSK) available at select Post Offices. The ATM-like kiosk, which accepts debit and credit cards only, can handle 80 percent of the transactions conducted at the retail counter such as buying stamps, mailing a parcel, or shipping an urgent letter or package by Express or Priority Mail,\" USPS said in a release.\n\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n\nAlthough post offices will be closed, FedEx will continue deliveries, though some have \"modified hours.\"\n\nUPS locations may be closed for the holiday, and there will be no pick up or delivery service, the company said.\n\n\"The UPS Store locations may be closed. Check with your local store for specific hours of operation,\" UPS stated.\n\nMuseums\n\nMany museums and cultural centers across the state remain open, with some even having free days.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago offers free days for residents every Monday from Jan. 6 through March 14. To receive free admission tickets, Illinois residents must reserve online in advance, the museum notes.\n\nThe Chicago History Museum will also offer free entry to Illinois residents for the holiday. The museum offers free admission on select holidays throughout the year, with this month's including Jan. 20-24 and Jan. 28-31. The museum is always free for active duty military and veterans, active duty Chicago police and firefighters, Illinois teachers, Illinois residents under age 18, and all children under 12.\n\nThe Shedd Aquarium will have free admission for Illinois residents Jan. 14 \u2013 21 and Jan. 28 \u2013 30\n\nDrivers Services Facilities\n\nAll Illinois Secretary of State Offices, including driver services facilities will be closed, in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nBanks\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank, the federal holiday means closures.\n\nRetail, Restaurants, Grocery Stores\n\nWhile most government functions will not be operating on Monday, most grocery stores, big box stores and restaurants will remain open.\n\nMajor chain stores such as Target, Costco, Walmart, The Home Depot, Jewel-Osco and Mariano's will remain open on the holiday.\n\nSchools\n\nAccording to the Illinois State Board of Education, Martin Luther King Jr. Day isn't considered a \"legal school holiday.\" However, the board does indicate that districts can choose to celebrate it. In those cases, the district considers it a \"Not in Attendance\" day, which means \"no students are engaged in learning as determined by the local school board.\n\nFor students in the Illinois districts that do have school on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a new law may apply, allowing them an excused absence in exchange for engaging in a civic activity.\n\nHouse Bill 5488, which took effect Jan. 1, 2023, states that any public middle or high school student will be permitted at least one \"day-long excused absence from school to engage in a civic event.\"\n\nAccording to the bill's text, a \"civic event\" is defined by an \"event sponsored by a non-profit organization or government entity that is open to the public,\" and can include \"an artistic or cultural performance or educational gathering that supports the mission of the sponsoring non-profit organization.\"",

The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete.\n\nIn a written dissent, Republican Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, who is set to become chair next week after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, criticized the decision to release the early version of the study saying that \u201cissuing these research summaries degrades the commission\u2019s Section 6(b) process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission should not be releasing staff\u2019s early impressions that \u2018can be outdated with new information\u2019 because the fact gathering process on the very issues being presented to the public is still underway,\u201d he said.\n\nUnits of Mastercard Inc., McKinsey & Co. and four other companies responded to the FTC\u2019s information demands about what pricing products they offer, the data they collect and how it\u2019s used to target which consumers receive offers, the FTC said.\n\nWhile other companies involved in the study aren\u2019t well-known, many of their clients are household brands. PROS Holdings Inc. and Revionics, a portfolio company of Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u2019s private equity business are also among the companies that turned over information to the FTC.\n\nPROS clients include Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Nestle SA. Revionics says it works mainly with retailers such as Home Depot Inc., and Bloomreach with home and apparel retailers including Kirkland\u2019s Inc.",

            "content": "ABOUT THIS BEFORE & AFTER\n\nPROJECT TYPE: Kitchen\n\nSKILL LEVEL: DIY\n\nMinetta Archer, an interior designer and business owner, has lived in her 725-square-foot Harlem apartment for 15 years. In that time she\u2019s been able to update her space, sometimes switching up the same room multiple times \u2014 including the kitchen, which she describes as originally having \u201cbad \u201990s laminate\u201d and being in \u201cvery poor condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I moved in, I went through several different iterations before landing on the current design,\u201d Minetta explains. \u201cI made updates at least four times prior that were just placeholders until I could do exactly what I wanted.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Minetta wanted to \u201cpush [herself] to create a more daring and striking design\u201d in the kitchen. She didn\u2019t have a specific inspiration to emulate, but Minetta knew she wanted to \u201cgo bolder.\u201d The rest of the rooms in her apartment had been drenched in a mix of patterns and colors, and she wanted to bring that gorgeous maximalism into the kitchen.\n\nLuckily, Minetta had made adjustments the previous time she updated the kitchen (in 2020) that would make this time around a little easier. For example, she\u2019d already sanded, primed, and painted the cabinets and added funky new hardware from The Home Depot. She started on the latest refresh by replacing the existing wallpaper with a peacock pattern from Rifle Paper Co. that \u201ccreated more movement and interest,\u201d she says.\n\nNext, she brought the outdoors in by painting her ceiling a bright blue to resemble the sky; she created a custom color by mixing a few blue paints she already had. Paint was also used to cover the vinyl flooring (she used a stencil to add a pattern) and the refrigerator. Once the painting was done, she covered the counters with faux marble contact paper, covered the existing backsplash, swapped out the faucet, and updated the range hood.\n\nWhat\u2019s so impressive about Minetta\u2019s new kitchen is that she did most of the renovations herself in just one month. And without a complete overhaul, she transformed the space while keeping the project budget around $3,000.\n\n\u201cI love that I didn\u2019t have to do a gut renovation in order to create something completely different,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying the kitchen is the polar opposite of its former self. Never underestimate the huge impact a cosmetic renovation can have.\u201d\n\nWhat was once a \u201cdated\u201d room has transformed into a \u201ccheerful environment,\u201d thanks to Minetta\u2019s clever updates. Since making the changes, she admits that she feels \u201calive whenever [she\u2019s] cooking,\u201d thanks to the bright colors and patterns.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), RTX Corp. (RTX) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), as well as two micro-cap stocks Kewaunee Scientific Corp. (KEQU) and AXIL Brands, Inc. (AXIL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nHome Depot\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+17.8% vs. +12.5%). The company\u2019s recovery in top-line trends is supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. The company delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in Q3 of fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand.\n\n\n\nHome Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology and improving the digital experience. HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4.\n\n\n\nHowever, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -1.3%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its wide range of combat-proven defense products from the Pentagon and its foreign allies. It won several notable defense awards during the third quarter.\n\n\n\nA steadily improving commercial air traffic has been bolstering commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position, which enables it to make successful share repurchases.\n\n\n\nHowever, rising crude price tends to put cost pressures on airlines and may affect the operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX. The company may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against its missile and defense unit. Supply-chain challenges also pose a threat to RTX\u2019s growth.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\n\n\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 shares have gained +25.9% over the past year against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of +62.3%. The company is benefiting from strength in the Applied Global Services segment, owing to the growing adoption of the 200-mm system. Solid momentum in the subscription and display businesses is a plus.\n\n\n\nGrowing Semiconductor Systems revenues owing to rebound in the semiconductor industry is a major positive. The company\u2019s strength in IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (ICAPS) is likely to continue aiding its position in the semiconductor industry in the days ahead. Its broad-based diversified portfolio remains its key growth driver.\n\n\n\nHowever, softness in the Corporate & Other segment remains a concern. Weakening momentum across Taiwan and Europe is a major negative. Growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China are headwinds.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Applied Materials here >>>)\n\n\n\nKewaunee Scientific\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry over the past year (+126.9% vs. -3.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $174.03 million demonstrates strong demand for its lab solutions, bolstered by global R&D investments. The Nu Aire acquisition expands market leadership, providing new revenue streams and operational synergies.\n\n\n\nDiversified revenues across life sciences, healthcare and education mitigate sector-specific risks, while a strengthened balance sheet enhances financial flexibility.\n\n\n\nHowever, risks include declining international sales (down 30.1% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025), rising operating expenses (up 13.9% year over year), raw material cost vulnerabilities and project-based revenue reliance. Additionally, limited shareholder returns and foreign currency risks weigh on long-term attractiveness.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Kewaunee Scientific here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of AXIL Brands have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry over the past year (-65.5% vs. +6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $27.48 million is facing risks which include declining operating margins, cash flow deficits, heavy vendor reliance, regulatory burdens and concentration risks (42% revenues from top customers). Competitive pressures and inventory challenges further threaten profitability, with net losses widening to $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, AXIL Brands' robust DTC sales growth highlights its strength in e-commerce, driving higher margins via enhanced digital platforms and customer retention. The company\u2019s proprietary product innovations, like the X-Core series, align with the growing hearing enhancement market (7.8% CAGR through 2028), boosting margins and competitive differentiation.\n\n\n\nThe gross margin improved 330 bps year over year from supply-chain efficiencies and product mix, while strategic retail partnerships (more than 125 locations in 2024) and international expansion diversified revenues.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on AXIL Brands here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BP p.l.c.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) stands against other best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nCompiled and published by Fortune Magazine, the Fortune 500 is an annual list that ranks the biggest US companies by revenue. In total, the Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ a workforce of 31 million around the globe.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks to Buy\n\n2024 proved to be a big year for large-cap stocks, as the broader US market achieved gains of nearly 25%, piggybacking on a 26% performance the year before. Large-cap stock funds, with the heaviest tilt toward growth stocks, performed the best last year, even as the market\u2019s rally somewhat broadened from the handful of mega tech companies that have led much of the bull market.\n\nHowever, the tailwinds that propelled the market to new heights are beginning to recede, as the rate of monetary policy easing slows down, long-term interests swing upward, inflation becomes sticky, and the US economy is slowing down. Moreover, the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump and his much-rumored tariffs could also herald a more volatile period for markets, as they could further fan inflation fears and put pressure on stock prices.\n\nThat said, the expected upcoming fluctuation isn\u2019t going to be something that the mega corporations haven\u2019t dealt with before. A 2023 report by J. P. Morgan revealed that despite the considerable volatility during the period, large-cap stocks gained around 162% between 2013 and 2023, galvanized primarily by big tech. Another 2023 report by CNBC unveiled that large US companies outperformed other investments between 2003 and 2023, with average returns of 9.3%. However, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as despite the stability and reliability large-cap stocks are known for, investors had to survive drops of 56.8% during the 2007-2009 bear market, 33.9% in 2020, and 25.4% in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the few tech giants regularly making headlines with their gains, large-cap dividend stocks could also be an attractive option for investors looking for a reliable, significant, and growing stream of income. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the broader US large caps are expected to post an 8% increase in dividend payments in 2025, compared to the 6.4% uptick in 2024, 5.1% gains in 2023, and the 10.8% increase witnessed in 2022.\n\nLarge-cap companies tend to have more robust balance sheets compared to their smaller counterparts, enabling them to navigate through market fluctuations more smoothly while also returning value to their shareholders. Corporations in the US have continuously grown their considerable cash stockpiles since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to the economic resilience we have witnessed recently. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group revealed that as of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, up 12.6% from the same period in 2024 and $1.28 trillion more from their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo collect data for this article, we referred to the top 50 companies among the Fortune Global Rankings. Then, we picked out 12 US-listed companies with the highest dividend yields as of January 13, 2025, and ranked them by their number of hedge fund investors according to the Insider Monkey database as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nDividend Yield: 2.31%\n\nMarket Cap: $403.4 billion\n\nComing in at number 5 on our list of the Best Large Cap Dividend Stocks is The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), the largest home improvement specialty retailer in the world, engaging in the sale of building materials and home improvement products. The company boasts over 2,300 stores in the US, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe housing market in the US has recently been under pressure due to the rising interest rates, elevating mortgage rates, and inflationary pressures on consumers in recent years. However, the recent decline in interest rates should provide some much-needed support. The stock price of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) also surged by 3.38% on the 15th of January after the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) was lower than expected for December. The falling inflation is good for the economy in general and should significantly benefit Home Depot.\n\nThe home improvement industry is large and fragmented, valued at around $1 trillion annually. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), despite being the largest player in the sector, commands a market share of only 15%. This means that the industry behemoth still has plenty of space to take share from smaller retailers that can\u2019t match it in brand recognition, inventory availability, or omnichannel capabilities.\n\nAlthough The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has struggled recently largely due to macroeconomic factors, its 60% payout ratio could be attractive for investors. The company maintains a strong cash position, generating more than $15 billion in operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2024. Home Depot announced a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share in November and has increased dividends every year since 2010.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about HD in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile Home Depot, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company\u2019s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic.

Fortunately, Home Depot is bringing some new items into stock that shoppers should take note of.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the hardware must-haves from Home Depot that are hitting the warehouse in 2025.\n\nBLACK+DECKER Dustbuster Blast Bagless Cordless Washable Filter Handheld Vacuum\n\nPrice: $44.99\n\nMelanie Musson, a retail finance expert with InsuranceProviders.com, said there aren\u2019t many tasks this handy and powerful cordless vacuum can\u2019t take on. \u201cCordless vacuums make life easier, and this small, handheld version is perfect for cleaning out your car and reaching into cupboards,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Dustbuster is easy to empty and charges quickly.\u201d\n\nBehr Paint 2025 Color of the Year \u201cRumors\u201d\n\nPrice: $52.98\n\nThis might be a totally new item, but it is novel. Behr\u2019s 2025 Color of the Year is making a splash at Home Depot right now. \u201cRumors is changing interior design,\u201d Josh Neuman, an eCommerce marketing professional and the founder of Chummy Tees, said. \u201cThe vivid ruby red is meant to motivate homeowners to embrace vibrant, personality-filled environments. It departs from neutral tones and encourages innovative home decor. Multiple Behr lines make this paint compatible with many surfaces and finishes, giving it a versatile alternative for DIYers and professionals.\u201d\n\nM18 FUEL 18V Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless 6-1/2 in. Circular Saw\n\nPrice: $199.00\n\n\u201cPersonally, I believe one of the best inventions just happens to be something that Home Depot is receiving more of, and that would be cordless tools,\u201d commented Tammy Sons, the founder and CEO of TN Nursery. \u201cThey have a variety of different brands to offer that are launching more and more new powerful battery-powered tools that are extremely convenient, as well as eco-friendly.\u201d\n\nThis cordless saw is on sale right now at Home Depot for $220.00 off the original price, so it might be too good to pass up.\n\nSustainable Laminate Flooring\n\nAlan Dewberry is a flooring and renovation expert and owner at Tile Factory Direct. Dewberry is looking forward to the rumored flooring releases from Home Depot that are better for the environment. \u201cHome Depot\u2019s predicted 2025 flooring will answer the increasing demands for sustainability, durability and style,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sustainable laminate flooring in the pipeline will probably be made from advanced recycling technologies and responsible sourcing, much like Shaw Floors\u2019 eco-focused products. These laminates are expected to feature low VOC emissions and certifications such as FloorScore, which ensure healthier indoor air quality.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Prices and availability accurate as of Jan. 10, 2024.",

Marcus, who died at 95 in 2024 with a net worth of more than $10 billion, served as Handy Dan's president. Blank, now 82 and worth over $9 billion, was the company's treasurer.\n\nMarcus and Blank were fired in 1978 after Handy Dan's corporate parent said in securities filings that it found \"unauthorized and unacceptable business practices\" at the company, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. Handy Dan's corporate parent later said the two men used company funds to pay employees to favor union decertification, the Journal reported.\n\nThe FBI began investigating in late 1978 after a lawyer for a retail workers labor union filed a complaint to federal authorities based on The Wall Street Journal story.\n\nFederal agents said their investigation substantiated the claim, according to the records. No charges were ever brought; the records cited \"insufficient\" evidence and \"statute of limitations problems.\" The effort to decertify the union was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n\"Investigation revealed that from early 1977 through early 1978 approximately $140,000 in corporate funds\" were paid to workers to influence them, an FBI agent wrote in a memo. \"Numerous employees have admitted receiving cash (over and above wages) usually received in plain envelopes.\"\n\nThe FBI interviewed at least eight witnesses, whose names were largely redacted in the records. One anti-union employee told investigators that money \"was only furnished to those whom the company thought would eventually vote for the decertification.\" Clinton Doolen, a manager who died in 1992, recalled Marcus saying that \"money was no object\" when it came to dislodging the union, the records show.\n\n\"Marcus was strictly against the unions and highly obsessed with getting the union completely out,\" another witness told the FBI. The witness said Marcus told them he was willing to use any means to break the union, and the witness \"could see that Marcus really meant it.\"\n\nMarcus offered a different version of events. In the 1999 book \"Built From Scratch,\" he said he learned some Handy Dan employees wanted to disband their union. He said he hired a lawyer and \"directed our personnel department to do whatever fell within the legal guidelines\" to support them.\n\nHe said that the chairman of Handy Dan's parent company twisted the truth and used an internal investigation \"as a tool to eliminate me,\" and that \"neither the Justice Department nor the SEC instigated investigations.\"\n\nFBI records show Marcus testified in a Securities and Exchange Commission proceeding in July 1978, about three months after he was fired. He declined, through a lawyer, to be interviewed by the FBI. It's not clear if Blank was a subject of inquiry by the SEC.\n\nThe SEC and two top-ranking officials at the Marcus Foundation didn't reply to comment requests, nor did Marcus' son Frederick Marcus, who is a director of the foundation. Representatives for Blank, Home Depot, the Justice Department, and the FBI declined to comment.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained the FBI records in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Blank's name was redacted, but his job title matched that of the subject in question. A third person whose name was redacted was also a subject of the investigation.\n\nThe FBI submitted a \"prosecutive report\" to the Justice Department in March 1982. A year later, a federal prosecutor decided not to move forward with the case. The prosecutor didn't believe there was enough evidence against Marcus, Blank, and the third person to indict them, and the union election at the center of the investigation was more than five years old, an FBI memo said.\n\nMarcus and Blank founded Home Depot in 1978, eventually transforming it into the world's largest home-improvement retail company. Its stores aren't unionized; in 2022, the last time a petition was filed at a store for a union election, union advocates suffered a resounding defeat.\n\nMarcus' anti-union sentiments were well known. In 2008, he called a bill that would make it easier for employees to form unions \"the demise of civilization,\" and in 2010, he founded the Job Creators Network, which has opposed bills that would increase union power.\n\nBoth men have been significant political donors. Blank has primarily supported Democratic candidates, while Marcus gave millions to Republican candidates, and once said that retail executives who weren't helping Republicans \"should be shot.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nRead the documents here:",

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nNow that we are relatively deep into January, otherwise known as the start of a new year, we are highly focused on at-home renovations, starting in the heart of the home, the kitchen. For most people, changing out the kitchen cabinets or sprucing them up with new hardware is a doable task. However, if you design them entirely from scratch, it's not cheap and it can be hard to find quality recommendations. That's why we put together a list of the best kitchen cabinet brands below. In terms of where to start, New York-based interior designer Nina Lichtenstein says, \"When choosing kitchen cabinets\u2014whether built-in or freestanding\u2014start by evaluating your priorities. Think about materials, finish, size, and storage functionality.\"\n\nThe latter will greatly affect your design choice as you want your cabinets to hold all your existing appliances and possibly any new ones you acquire later. \"Upper cabinets are perfect for lightweight items like glassware, dishes, and spices. Use these for items you access frequently. Lower cabinets are for storing heavy items like pots, pans, mixing bowls, and small appliances,\" Lichtenstein says. \"Consider pull-out shelves to make access easier. Pantry cabinets are tall cabinets that are great for pantry staples, dry goods, and even broom or cleaning supply storage. Lastly, freestanding cabinets can serve as stylish accent pieces for showcasing decorative items or storing less frequently used serving ware.\"\n\nReady to upgrade your kitchen storage in a highly stylized way? Keep reading. We've got tons of excellent options for you.\n\nFrontgate\n\nIf you are a Frontgate fan, you may be surprised to find it on a list of kitchen cabinets, but alas, here we are. Frontgate has a massive furniture collection, bed linens, rugs, and more. In other words, the online marketplace sells everything you'd need for your home, including kitchen cabinets. Full disclosure: The selection is not massive, but it is attractive. Most are modular, so you can mix, match, and build your perfect hutch. Be sure to take a peek at the .\n\nrta cabinet store\n\nUnlike some of the other retailers on our list, which sell more than just cabinets, RTA Cabinet Store does not, which means there are tons and tons of options to consider, and you are bound to find something that suits your space. When shopping, you'll notice that there are two categories to choose between: custom and assembled cabinets, so make your choice depending on the scope of your project.\n\nShop RTA Cabinet Store\n\nWayfair\n\nWayfair is the place to get literally everything for your home, from pillows to small appliances and everything in between. So, it should come as no surprise that the enormous formerly online-only outpost (there's now a brick-and-mortar outside Chicago) sells an impressive selection of kitchen cabinets that range from wall-mounted options to freestanding alternatives. Most of them require assembly, but if you're not in the mood or lack the power drill skills to do it yourself, pay around $85 for expert assembly.\n\nAllModern\n\nAs a Wayfair-owned brand, AllModern also has quite a few kitchen cabinets. Though these are all midcentury modern-inspired\u2014think earthy colors, sharp lines, and not a whole lot of excess ornamentation. Plus, like its parent company, AllModern is one of the more affordable brands out there.\n\nCrate & Barrel\n\nCrate & Barrel is more famous for its myriad sofa designs and smaller kitchen wares than it is for cabinets, but there are a few on offer, and they're all beautiful standalone pieces. So, if you're looking for an island with storage, a cabinet to push against the wall, or more, take a peek at what Crate & Barrel has to offer.\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nAmerican Woodmark is a popular cabinet brand available at The Home Depot and is tied with KraftMaid for second place in the J.D. Power report. All of the brand\u2019s cabinet options are assembled in the United States, and they come in more than 15 different collections that fit over a dozen design styles\u2014from coastal to farmhouse and everything in between.\n\nAmazon\n\nYou may not be able to get one-of-a-kind custom cabinets here, but you can snag ready-to-ship high-quality ones that can arrive on your doorstep within two days. Plus, if you\u2019re into DIY, you can always rework them (read: paint the doors and swap out hardware) yourself.\n\nIKEA\n\nIEKA\n\nIt should come as no surprise that your go-to one-stop shop for affordable homewares is also one of the top places to buy the best kitchen cabinets. According to a report by J.D. Power \u2014which surveyed more than 1,500 customers who had bought kitchen cabinets within the year\u2014IKEA\u2019s Sektion cabinet system ranked the highest in overall satisfaction.\n\nThe ranking was based on five different features: design elements, operational performance, ordering and delivery, price, and warranty. The Sektion system can also be customized with dozens of different door styles, drawer fronts, hardware, and interior organizers, and you can install it yourself or have IKEA handle it for you .\n\nShop IKEA\n\nLowe's\n\nAnother J.D. Power survey winner, KraftMaid came in second for overall customer satisfaction with kitchen cabinets, so you know it\u2019s a good option based on reviews.

Its cabinet options include four collections, each of which comes in various color options (including eight different wood finishes and 24 paints) and can be customized to fit your style.\n\nShop Waterworks\n\nSt. Charles New York\n\nAs an 80+ year-old brand, St. Charles has long been associated with luxury.

Economists had expected 3.3% annual growth.\n\nSlowing inflation is good for Home Depot because it offers consumers some relief from higher prices, and, more importantly, because it makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower interest rates this year. The housing market is highly sensitive to interest rates, and mortgage rates have been elevated since the pandemic, slowing down home sales, which has impacted Home Depot.\n\nIn its forecast last month, the Fed projected two rate cuts this year, though that could change if inflation falls.\n\nHome Depot has struggled with the slow housing market, and lower interest rates would likely help the home improvement retailer bounce back.\n\nWhat's next for Home Depot?\n\nHome Depot reported another decline in comparable sales in its third-quarter earnings report, and growth is likely to remain muted until the housing market bounces back.\n\nThe peak selling season of the year, springtime, is around the corner, but meaningful rate cuts seem unlikely before then. Still, falling inflation will benefit Home Depot eventually.",

            "content": "The Latest Stock Movement\n\nShares of Home Depot have experienced a notable rise, climbing 3.2% shortly after reports emerged regarding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December. The insights indicated a better-than-anticipated core CPI, suggesting positive economic implications.\n\nHome Depot stands poised to benefit from these changes. While the overall CPI saw an increase to 2.9% year-on-year, the core inflation rate, which excludes volatile elements like food and energy, showed a promising decrease to 3.2% annually. Experts had projected a slightly higher growth rate, making the actual results encouraging.\n\nWhy This Matters for Home Depot\n\nThis decline in core inflation brings some relief to consumers facing elevated prices. More importantly, it boosts the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might proceed with additional interest rate cuts in the near future. Given the sensitivity of the housing market to interest rate fluctuations, this is particularly significant for Home Depot, which has been impacted by the sluggish housing sector tied to high mortgage rates.\n\nLooking ahead, the company faces challenges, having reported a drop in comparable sales recently. The forecast for improvement hinges on the revival of the housing market. As spring approaches, the potential for sales growth remains on the horizon, especially with the promise of inflation easing. Home Depot\u2019s fortunes could see a turnaround if economic conditions align in its favor.\n\nUnderstanding the Ripple Effects of Home Depot\u2019s Stock Movement\n\nThe recent rise in Home Depot\u2019s stock\u20143.2% following encouraging Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports\u2014serves as an insightful case study on how financial markets correlate with broader economic indicators and their subsequent effects on the environment, humanity, and the global economy.\n\nAt its core, the decrease in the core CPI\u2014particularly at 3.2%\u2014suggests a more stable economic environment, reducing the pressure on consumers grappling with the burden of rising prices. This economic stabilization is significant for Home Depot, but it also resonates far beyond the immediate financial performance of one company. The connection between consumer prices, interest rates, and the housing market creates a chain reaction that can have profound implications for future trends affecting both the economy and the environment.\n\nWhen interest rates are lowered, mortgage rates typically follow suit, reviving the housing market. An active housing market generally leads to increased construction activity and home renovations, which can boost demand for building materials and services. However, this uptick in construction may carry environmental consequences, especially if it leads to unsustainable development practices. Increased housing demand often requires expanding urban sprawl, which can exacerbate issues like deforestation, habitat loss, and increased greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.\n\nMoreover, while Home Depot could benefit economically from a housing market resurgence, this could simultaneously hinder humanity\u2019s efforts to combat climate change if proper safeguards and sustainable practices are not integrated into the construction processes. The future of humanity hinges on balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. As we strive for a more sustainable world, corporations like Home Depot will need to adopt green practices that prioritize renewable resources, efficient energy use, and reduced waste.\n\nThe connection between Home Depot\u2019s stock movement, consumer confidence, and the housing market sheds light on a critical aspect of economic recovery post-pandemic. It illustrates the ongoing interplay between financial markets and everyday life, underlining why we must consider the long-term implications of our economic decisions. The choices made by companies today, informed by stock movements and consumer responses, will shape the trajectory of both economic growth and environmental health for generations to come.\n\nIn conclusion, as Home Depot positions itself to capitalize on potential economic improvements, stakeholders must be aware of the broader implications of this growth. The decisions involved in constructing new homes and renovating existing ones possess the power to either support or undermine the sustainability goals pivotal to securing a livable planet for future generations. The future of humanity relies on integrating economic ambitions with environmental stewardship, ensuring that growth is achieved responsibly.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s Stock Surge: What Investors Need to Know\n\nThe Latest Stock Movement\n\nHome Depot (NYSE: HD) has witnessed a significant uptick in its stock, jumping 3.2% following reports released on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December. The data indicates a more favorable than expected core CPI, which suggests positive economic trends that could benefit the retail giant.\n\nAs of December, while the overall CPI reflected a year-on-year increase of 2.9%, the core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile sectors of food and energy, showed a promising decline to 3.2% annually. This outcome was particularly uplifting, as experts had anticipated a higher inflation figure, making the actual results a boost for market sentiment.\n\nWhy This Matters for Home Depot\n\nThe decrease in core inflation is crucial for consumers grappling with high prices. It also enhances the prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a situation that is especially pertinent to the housing market, an area that significantly impacts Home Depot\u2019s performance. With the housing sector facing headwinds due to elevated mortgage rates, the potential for an economic turnaround presents a critical opportunity for the company.\n\nPros and Cons of Investing in Home Depot\n\nPros:\n\n\u2013 Potential for Growth: With the possibility of interest rate cuts, Home Depot could benefit from increased consumer spending in home improvement as affordability improves.\n\n\u2013 Strong Market Position: As one of the largest home improvement retailers, Home Depot has a strong brand presence and market share.\n\n\u2013 Resilience During Economic Fluctuations: Historically, home improvement retailers tend to perform well even during economic downturns, as customers prioritize home maintenance and improvements.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Dependence on Housing Market: Continued recovery is contingent on the housing market\u2019s performance, which can be unpredictable.\n\n\u2013 Recent Declines in Sales: Home Depot has reported a drop in comparable sales, signaling challenges in consumer demand.\n\n\u2013 Rising Inflation: Increases in material costs can impact profit margins and consumer spending habits.\n\nMarket Analysis and Future Trends\n\nAs we move into the spring season, experts predict that the housing market may start to gain momentum, a development that could trigger sales growth for Home Depot. Additionally, as inflation eases and if interest rates are reduced, consumers may be more inclined to invest in home improvement projects.\n\nSecurity Aspects and Investing Insights\n\nInvestors considering Home Depot should evaluate the current economic landscape, particularly inflation rates, mortgage rates, and consumer spending trends. A diversified investment strategy can help mitigate risks, especially given the uncertain dynamics of the housing market.\n\nConclusion\n\nHome Depot\u2019s stock movement in light of the CPI results is a signal of potential economic improvement. However, the company\u2019s success will depend on broader economic conditions, particularly in the housing market. As the year progresses, it will be crucial for stakeholders to monitor these developments closely.\n\nFor further updates and detailed economic analyses, visit Home Depot.",

She began studying dance as a child and worked through high school, ultimately joining the June Taylor dancers and performing rhythm tap.\n\nShe later owned the Louisville Dance Academy for 37 years, teaching others to dance. Good posture is a priority, so she stands with her back against the wall once a week to see how she\u2019s doing and fix any slouching.\n\nWilson calls movement \u201cvery important\u201d to longevity and she\u2019s still dancing at 100.\n\n\u201cI have the radio everywhere. Thank goodness for Alexa. I tell her to play something that\u2019s really good to jump to, and I have at it,\u201d she says. \u201cI let go and move and do what I want to do and it feels good. That\u2019s my exercise.\u201d\n\nWilson likes to stay creative: She has performed on stage in recent years, written a cookbook and paints. (Courtesy Home Depot)\n\nBe willing to change your diet to stay healthy\n\nTwo different health issues prompted Wilson to change her diet.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed with cancer, an oncologist nurse told her \u201ccancer feeds on sugar\u201d and recommended avoiding it. \u201cI said, I can handle that,\u201d Wilson recalls.\n\n(There\u2019s no evidence sugar will make cancer worse or that a tumor will shrink or disappear if a patient stops eating it, according to current guidance from the National Cancer Institute. But eating lots of sugar can lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for cancer.)\n\nWilson stopped eating bacon and cheese years ago when she was diagnosed with very high cholesterol. After working with a nutritionist, she focuses on eating lean protein like chicken, fish and steak, and avoiding white flour.\n\n\u201cI eat well. I don\u2019t eat out a lot. I do my own cooking and enjoy it,\u201d she says.\n\nHave pleasures to look forward to\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t shun sweets altogether.\n\n\u201cI always have a chocolate cake in my freezer,\u201d she says. \u201cI take a slice but maybe once a week.\u201d\n\nShe also keeps ice cream in the freezer and has a tablespoon once in a while. When she gets a gift of candy, it lasts her for months because she cuts the pieces in half and eats half a piece a week.\n\nThe key is to indulge occasionally, but not overdo it, which takes a lot of discipline, Wilson advises.\n\nStay creative\n\nBesides dancing, Wilson likes to sing, and has performed on stage in recent years. She\u2019s written a cookbook, paints and has an Instagram page devoted to her artwork.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\n\nThe centenarian credits \u201cstubbornness and determination\u201d as well as common sense for getting through tough times and living a long life.\n\nShe also tries to release negative feelings and stay optimistic \u2014 a trait linked with longevity.\n\n\u201cI always say, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t let everything make you angry. Anger takes a lot of muscle and a lot of good out of your life,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to think positive than to think negative. It takes a lot less effort. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on TODAY.com. Read more from TODAY:",

            "content": "There are few companies out there that have done as well for investors as Home Depot (HD -4.19%). Since its initial public offering in 1981, the home improvement chain has generated a total return of 3,297,000%. That monster gain would've turned a tiny $31 investment back then into $1 million today.\n\nToday, Home Depot carries a market cap of $387 billion. And it reported $155 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Could this retail stock, which has made its longtime shareholders extremely wealthy in the past, be your ticket to becoming a millionaire by 2030?\n\nShort-term headwinds\n\nAs of this writing, shares of Home Depot trade about 10% off their peak and the stock has underperformed the broader S&P 500 during the past five years. There's some negative sentiment surrounding the business.\n\nThe company posted double-digit percentage revenue gains in fiscal 2020 and 2021, driven by strong household spending power and greater interest in taking on renovation projects amid the pandemic. But since then, the business has been dealing with a notable slowdown.\n\nSame-store sales did rise 3.1% in fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 29, 2023). They then dipped 3.2% in fiscal 2023. And the leadership team sees that key performance metric falling again by 2.5% in the current fiscal year.\n\nDiscouraged by higher interest rates and lingering inflationary pressures, consumers aren't as inclined to make big-ticket discretionary purchases. That's particularly true when compared to just a few years ago.\n\n\"We continue to see pressure on larger remodeling projects driven by the higher interest rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Chief Executive Officer Ted Decker said on the Q3 2024 earnings call in November.\n\nLong-term tailwinds\n\nHome Depot might be dealing with some issues in the recent past, but the business is still in a favorable competitive position. For starters, the home improvement industry is large and fragmented, estimated to be worth $1 trillion annually. Home Depot only commands about 15% share of this market, even though it's the biggest player. This means it has a sizable runway ahead of it to take share from smaller retailers that don't have the brand recognition, inventory availability, or omnichannel capabilities that Home Depot does.\n\nThere are also industry tailwinds that are worth mentioning. In the U.S., the median age of a home in 2022 was 40 years. That was up from 35 years in 2012. Older homes unsurprisingly require more upkeep and maintenance, which supports durable demand for Home Depot.\n\nAnd there has been a significant shortage of new homes being built in this country, with an inventory gap estimated to be as many as 7 million units. Lower supply disincentivizes people from moving to a new dwelling, again supporting renovation activity that drives sales for Home Depot.\n\nManagement also cites the fact that home prices in the U.S. are up significantly during the past five years. This equity can be tapped to fund home improvements and upgrades.\n\nDon't look for huge returns\n\nHome Depot's ascent during the past four decades has been unbelievable. However, this is a mature enterprise that isn't going to experience outsized growth anymore. In the past five years, earnings per share rose at a 7.7% annualized pace.\n\nConsequently, investors should temper their expectations. The shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.4, which is 19% more expensive than the trailing-five-year average. That higher valuation makes it more difficult to achieve market-beating returns.\n\nOf course, if you are able to invest a huge starting sum, then perhaps the stock can make you a millionaire in about five years' time. But to expect life-changing returns from a mature business like Home Depot with a smaller initial capital base in a short period is unlikely. Investors hoping to hit a home run should look elsewhere.",

The Atlanta-based retailer then sued Steadfast and Great American in federal court in Cincinnati to recover the $50 million it had in general liability coverage.\n\nThe trial judge awarded the insurers summary judgment, finding that their policies excluded coverage for electronic data. Home Depot appealed.\n\nRepresentatives for the parties did not respond to requests for comment.",

            "content": "In an unexpected twist of fate, Katelyn Ansari\u2019s life took a dramatic turn after a viral TikTok moment at Home Depot. The video not only introduced her to the love of her life, Tryce, but also captured the hearts of millions online. Katelyn opens up about her journey, navigating newfound fame, and what\u2019s next for her and Tryce.\n\nThe Knockturnal: Your viral moment at Home Depot captivated so many people. How did that experience change the trajectory of your life and career?\n\nKatelyn Ansari: This whole experience has changed my life in so many ways. First, I was able to find a man I\u2019m head over heels with. Tryce is everything I put on my vision board for the love I strived to find. Secondly, our story went crazy viral and literally broke the internet in a week\u2019s time. Tryce and I have quickly become the \u201cHome Depot couple,\u201d and that\u2019s not going away anytime soon.\n\nThe Knockturnal: Finding love in such an unexpected place captivated millions. What was it about that moment that resonated with so many people, and how has it influenced your content?\n\nKatelyn: I think everyone loves a good old-fashioned love story. We all know that online dating sucks\u2014you get trapped in these apps and algorithms, swiping past people you aren\u2019t remotely interested in. Even when you find someone, it\u2019s just this annoying small talk where you know they\u2019re talking to 10 other people. It feels hopeless and not romantic at all.\n\nTryce and I met in such an innocent, organic way. We both have similar paths; we got divorced, took up dancing to find a new social circle, and love flipping houses. It really feels like we were meant to meet. I think people resonate with that because when they see us stepping outside our comfort zones, it shows how fun and rewarding that can be.\n\nThe Knockturnal: How has your relationship evolved since that viral moment? What\u2019s it like now, and how do you navigate both personal and public life?\n\nKatelyn: I\u2019m a pretty independent and solo person, but I want our story to be ours, so I lean on Tryce a lot to make sure he\u2019s comfortable with everything I\u2019m posting. In turn, he\u2019s really been my emotional rock. Nobody tells you how life-changing going viral can be. I love the growth, but it came with a lot of additional eyes I wasn\u2019t prepared for. Tryce really calms my nerves and empowers me to keep going.\n\nThe Knockturnal: What was your biggest struggle with dating apps, and how did your experience with finding love in such an unexpected way change your perspective on online dating?\n\nKatelyn: My biggest struggle was the communication. I\u2019m such an introvert, so small talk drives me nuts. I\u2019d rather meet someone and know right away if we\u2019re going to click. Meeting someone organically is the best way. I figured out the kind of man I liked, figured out where he\u2019d likely hang out, and put myself there. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll ever date, and hopefully, I\u2019m never single again.\n\nThe Knockturnal: You\u2019ve built a personal brand around love, home projects, and travel. What\u2019s the balance like between creating content that feels authentic while keeping up with the demands of your audience?\n\nKatelyn: The besties are so invested; I want to give them all the content, but it\u2019s a balance of staying grounded and putting yourself out there. I want to protect our relationship but share the things we both agree on and the growing pains. We\u2019ve really become a united front in terms of what we\u2019re sharing on social and what we want to keep private.\n\nFor example, one night we were debating whether I was wearing sweatpants or pajamas, and we took to TikTok for a final answer. It was a way to bring in our audience with the fun we\u2019re having while keeping our relationship ours. I loved it.\n\nThe Knockturnal: Has your approach to content creation changed since you first went viral, especially in terms of the topics you cover and how you engage with your followers?\n\nKatelyn: Oh my gosh, totally! I\u2019ll play around with the content to see what performs best and what the girlies like. The highest-performing content always includes Tryce. My audience loves seeing me happy, and it\u2019s so refreshing and special to have a core group of girlies who are supportive and want the best for you.\n\nThe Knockturnal: What\u2019s been the most surprising or unexpected part of your journey since becoming a digital creator, and how do you handle the pressure of maintaining that online presence?\n\nKatelyn: I\u2019m not sure I can share all the details, but we\u2019re going on a TV show soon. Tryce and I are so nervous but also so excited for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nThe Knockturnal: Looking ahead, are there any exciting projects or milestones you can share with us? What\u2019s next for you and your relationship, both in terms of content and personal life?\n\nKatelyn: Absolutely! Content-wise, we\u2019re taking it day by day and sharing our lives authentically. We\u2019re also talking big things like buying a house, getting married, and maybe having babies. We\u2019re really excited to see where life takes us.\n\nTo keep up with Katelyn Ansari\u2019s journey, follow her on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook for love stories, home projects, travel adventures, and more!",

            "content": "Dividends hold particular significance, especially as the broader market has experienced consecutive gains of over 20%, a scenario not seen since the late 1990s. Moreover, the low payout ratio, currently at 29% compared to the historical average of 50%, suggests there is considerable potential for companies to increase their dividend payouts. Kwon pointed out that another key factor supporting dividend investing is the growing number of retired baby boomers seeking income. With cash products yielding around 4%, there is a strong demand for dividends, as investors are looking for immediate cash returns and are pressuring companies to increase their dividend distributions.\n\nDividends historically accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total return from 1936 to 2012 but have contributed only 16% over the past ten years, according to a research note from BofA Securities released late last year. Looking forward, Kwon anticipates that dividends will have a more significant impact on total returns compared to the previous decade.\n\nAnalysts note that, from a broad perspective, earnings growth has traditionally been the primary driver of dividends. Last year saw strong earnings growth, and they anticipate an even better performance in 2025. Goldman predicts an 11% increase in earnings per share for this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024. This is expected to result in a 7% rise in dividends, compared to a 6% increase last year. Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 12% boost in dividends this year, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nThe year 2024 proved favorable for dividends, even though the Dividend Aristocrats Index lagged behind the broader market. Throughout the year, US companies consistently increased or upheld their dividend payouts. In addition, several major tech firms began offering dividends, signaling to investors that it's possible for a company to focus on both growth and shareholder returns. By September 30, 2024, approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P index were distributing dividends, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past decade. Notably, nearly 24% of these dividend-paying firms were in the technology sector, a significant increase from 13% ten years ago. Sectors such as healthcare and industrials also experienced notable growth in the number of companies offering dividends. This broader distribution of dividends has expanded the range of investment opportunities, giving equity-income investors more access to high-growth, dynamic, and innovative companies. Given these developments, analysts remain optimistic about their performance heading into 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis optimism about dividend stocks is largely rooted in their historical performance, as they have been instrumental in reducing overall portfolio volatility and can help cushion losses when stock prices decline. Research indicates that dividend-paying stocks often outperform their non-dividend-paying counterparts during bear markets, such as during the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. This may be because companies that pay dividends are typically larger, more established, and more profitable, making them more resilient than the broader market.\n\nFrom October 2019 to September 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in the market\u2019s total performance, equity income funds demonstrated lower volatility and reduced downside risk compared to the broader market. Given this, we will discuss the most reliable dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to identify companies with a history of dividend growth spanning over 10 years. From this group, we selected companies offering dividend yields of at least 1% as of January 12. From that selection, we identified the ten stocks that hedge funds favored the most during the third quarter of 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Home Depot, Inc. (HD) the Best Home Appliance Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies.\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend stocks. The American home improvement company is currently facing some challenges. As the business is closely tied to the housing market, it has been affected by rising interest rates and inflationary pressures on consumers in recent years. However, Home Depot remains the dominant player in its industry, which management values at $1 trillion. The aging housing stock, combined with a shortage of available homes, is expected to drive long-term demand. In addition, the recent decline in interest rates should provide some support. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 10%.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported $40.22 billion in revenue, marking a 6.6% increase from the same quarter last year. It achieved operating income of $5.4 billion, with an operating margin of 13.5%. The growth was driven by higher customer demand for seasonal products and outdoor projects, along with a boost in sales from hurricane-related needs.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about HD in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile Home Depot, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company\u2019s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.\u201d\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) maintained a strong cash position in FY24. In the first nine months of the year, the company generated over $15 billion in operating cash flow. This strong financial performance allows the company to continue its reputation as a reliable dividend payer. It has been consistently increasing its dividend payouts to shareholders for 14 consecutive years. Its quarterly dividend currently comes in at $2.25 per share for a dividend yield of 2.31%, as of January 12.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 82 funds held stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of roughly $7.6 billion.\n\nOverall HD ranks 5th on our list of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Home Depot is a US-based multinational big-box retailer focusing on the home improvement market. It is the largest home improvement retailer in the US and has operations in all Canadian provinces, all Mexican states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company employs more than 490,000 individuals and brought in more than $150 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021.\n\nHome Depot was founded in 1978 by five partners with a vision to become the largest home supply superstore. The company got its first financing with the aid of Ken Langone and opened its first two stores in 1979. By 1981 the company was going public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange that raised a whopping $4.1 million. The company switched its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in 1984 and has been traded there ever since.\n\n1984 also brought the company\u2019s first expansions outside its home territory of Georgia. By the end of the year, there were 19 Home Depots, and by 1989 it was indeed the largest home improvement retailer in the U.S. Not long after, to spur additional growth, the company added a line of product installation services that was very successful. That same year, in 1991, the company began making its first major acquisitions.\n\nBy 1995 Home Depot operated 350 stores across the contiguous US. It moved into the Mexican market in 2002 and opened its first landscape supply. In 2008 the company experienced its first decline in business due to the housing market bubble and subsequent economic recession, but the company was able to weather the storm. Growth was back on the table in 2013, and momentum has built since then.\n\nToday, Home Depot operates a network of more than 3,500 stores in North America and adjacent territories. The company lists 35,000 products in-store with another 1 million online. In regard to eCommerce, Home Depot has been a leader in digital sales channels and launched its digital store in 2000, more than a decade ahead of many others in the retail industry. The company\u2019s goal here is to provide a seamless experience between online and physical retail they call The One Home Depot strategy.\n\nHome Depot is also a leader in customer-centric and employee-centric operations. The company\u2019s guiding principle is illustrated by an inverted pyramid with customers at the top and the CEO at the bottom. In between are the front-line associates, field and customer support to make it all work. The company believes its total addressable market is worth $900 billion in annual sales, leaving plenty of room to continue growing. The near-term goal is to top $200 billion in annual sales, which will happen before 2030.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s mascot is Homer D. Poe. Homer D. Poe is a friendly-looking fellow wearing a cap that has been featured in Home Improvement advertising and merchandising materials for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Often, shoppers can save 70% to 75% off the original price that way.\n\nWhat if the price tag ends in zeros, like $20.00? Dad Deals said this indicates the clearance item is brand new to the rack. Let it linger there for a while, as it will become cheaper over time. These items will then phase into ending in six cents, such as $6.86, which indicates the item is 25% to 50% off the normal price. Eventually, the sale item will end in three cents, indicating the final clearance and best possible pricing.\n\nHow about price tags ending in 88 cents, like $14.88? These indicate special buys.

(KCTV) - Two Romanian nationals have been charged in connection to the theft of thousands of dollars after a string of home improvement store thefts across the country led them to Missouri.\n\nPlatte County, Missouri, Circuit Court records filed on Friday, Jan. 10, have revealed that Stefan Florin, 33, and Crisan Vasile, 44, Romanian nationals, were charged with stealing following the theft of thousands of dollars in smoke detectors from a metro area Home Depot.\n\nA probable cause statement filed by law enforcement officials indicated that around 11:15 p.m. on Oct. 10, they were called to the Home Depot at 8900 Skyview Ave. in Kansas City with reports of a theft.\n\nInvestigators noted that both Florin and Vasile were caught on surveillance as they loaded more than 100 boxes of smoke detectors into a shopping cart. As one distracted an employee the other checked out only $27 of the $5,180 total in merchandise.\n\nHome Depot employees told law enforcement officials that the pair had been identified, as they had stolen from other Home Depots and Lowes throughout the country. Both had been arrested in Chesterfield on Oct. 14 after they stole smoke detectors from an area Lowe\u2019s.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol Agents were able to provide additional information that identified Florin and Vasile. Both have refused to provide a statement to investigators.\n\nBoth have been charged with stealing. A warrant has been issued for Florin\u2019s arrest with a $15,000 bond attached. A warrant was also issued for Crisan\u2019s arrest but with a $20,000 bond attached. As of Sunday, Jan. 12, neither appeared to be behind Platte Co. bars.\n\nA hearing has not yet been scheduled for either defendant. No further information has been released.\n\nCopyright 2025 KCTV.

Little did he know he\u2019d eventually become CEO of one of the largest suppliers of ladders and ultimately realize the American Dream of pulling them up again.\n\nToday Home Depot has over 2,300 stores around the world including 187 in Texas, a land where companies aren\u2019t required to subscribe to workers\u2019 comp for their injured employees. In a related story, Home Depot\u2019s 500,000 employees have an estimated 200,000 thumbs.\n\nIn 1981, the company created its \u201cmuch-loved DIY mascot,\u201d Homer D. Poe. Homer still remains a friendly and helpful presence at the company even though he looks just like that guy who obsessively darts his tongue back-and-forth while peering through your bathroom window.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, Homer \u201chas a wife named Daisy and a dog named Carl.\u201d As for what\u2019s in his Speedo, Homer just calls them, \u201cMr. Happy and my two brothers Darrell and Darrell.\u201d\n\nA trailblazer with boundless compassion, Marcus founded the Marcus Autism Center where he poured $25 million into the search for the causes and a cure for autism. Then he backed a lawsuit to overturn federal student loan forgiveness. Because what better way is there to find a cure for autism than by making sure nobody can afford to learn about it?\n\nHis generosity didn\u2019t end there. In 2020 he donated over $27 million to republicans so Donald Trump could nominate as head of the HHS a guy who believes autism is caused by vaccines and pregnant mothers who get frightened by elephants.\n\nBut perhaps his most celebrated role in the fighting autism was sending millions of dollars to Israel so they could bomb over 5,000 autistic kids in Gaza. That should do it.\n\nIn 2020 with the help of 12 million of Marcus\u2019 Depot Dollars, Donald Trump was able to flip two houses of Congress and still have enough left over to buy the house of every Supreme Court justice\u2019s mother. He\u2019s currently planning to gut and rebuild the Presidential residence using refurbished pallets of entry-level granite countertops and motion activated brushed-bronze faucets.\n\nCompany executives in mourning say they\u2019re consoling themselves with the thought Marcus is in the afterlife refusing bathroom breaks to the wandering spirits of dead employees impaled by crowbars.\n\nMarcus\u2019 memorial in Georgia was attended by lines of tearful spectators longing for that one last chance to return a high-priced item without a receipt.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks people to donate to causes Marcus was passionate about. Like DIY genocides, post-genocide fixer uppers and installing quality drywall between women and their rights.\n\nMarcus requested his body be crushed by a pallet of microwave ovens, run over by a forklift, exposed to an unregulated amount of chemicals and dropped onto a defective paint shaker.\n\nThe remains will then be disassembled and divided among 90 distribution centers around the country and sent to 2,000 stores for in-store pickup.\n\nBuy my disgusting book by clicking on this link to evil Amazon!",

            "content": "Wall Street was enamored with tech stocks in 2024, choosing to leave many dividend stocks behind as a result. The dividend-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -1.30%) underperformed the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.96%) by more than 15 percentage points. The good news for income investors is this preference means there are deals to be had right now if you're willing to hold a few quality stocks for the long term.\n\nWhile many well-known dividend payers seem attractive here in early 2025, two appear primed to deliver especially strong returns going forward. Here are some good reasons to buy McDonald's (MCD -0.64%) and Home Depot (HD -4.19%), even if you already own shares of these companies.\n\nGet to know McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's is a known commodity among income investors. Following this past November's 6% dividend increase, the fast-food giant's streak of annual raises now sits at 48.\n\nSure, that's not long enough to make Mickey D's a Dividend King, which requires 50 consecutive years of hikes. But entrance into that exclusive club seems highly likely in a few years. McDonald's yield is currently 2.4%, giving it the 11th highest payout among the 30 members of the Dow.\n\nThe stock has underperformed recently, but that's mainly due to some challenging times for the industry. Budgets for McDonald's core customers were pressured by inflation through most of 2023, leading to unusually weak operating results. Comparable-store sales were flat in the core U.S. market last quarter and declined 1.5% globally for the period.\n\n\"Consumers ... continue to be mindful about their spending,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in late October.\n\nInvestors will want to watch for a growth rebound in the year ahead. Management is planning to lean on marketing, competitive pricing, and the digital ordering channel as pillars of its turnaround strategy. Yet even if it takes longer than expected to get the chain back up to faster comps gains, shareholders will likely profit from owning this highly profitable, cash-rich business over many years.\n\nThere's no place like Home (Depot)\n\nHigh interest rates haven't been great for the housing market, and it's easy to see the negative impact on Home Depot's results lately. The home improvement giant said in mid-November that comps are on pace to decline by nearly 3% for the full fiscal 2024 year, following strong growth in 2023.\n\nMortgage rates are still elevated, meaning there's a good chance the chain will post another year of lackluster sales gains in 2025. Yet, Home Depot might also post a quick rebound if economic conditions don't worsen.\n\nComps improved to a 1% decline last quarter, after all, compared to a 3% slump in the fiscal Q2 period. Management said late last year that \"we saw better engagement,\" as customer traffic improved to a flat result from a 2% decline in the previous quarter .\n\nMeanwhile, Home Depot's profit margin is holding up at nearly 14% of sales, compared to rival Lowe's and its 12% rate. Watch for continued outperformance here to keep Home Depot on top in the home improvement industry.\n\nAs for Home Depot stock, it seems attractive at 26 times earnings, down slightly from the recent peak of 29 times earnings. Patience should help reward investors who buy in at around that price and simply wait for the eventual recovery in the housing market to help return the company to growth.\n\nHome Depot should accumulate a nice share of those rebound gains, just as it has for the last several decades. That's the surest path toward positive long-term returns for any income investor.",

Get the Marketplace newsletter every Friday.\n\nCBC investigation uncovers grocers overcharging customers by selling underweighted meat\n\nGrocery stores overcharge for meat by including package weight Duration 2:36 A CBC News investigation discovered some Canadian grocers were found to be overcharging customers, potentially by including the weight of the packaging in the cost of meat, which over time could add up to millions in profit. One of the grocers has apologized and all have pledged to address the issue.\n\nThe Loblaw grocery chain overcharged customers by selling underweighted meat across 80 stores for an undisclosed period that ended in December 2023, a CBC News investigation has found.\n\nOn top of that, over the past few months, CBC News visited seven major grocery stores in three different provinces and discovered packages of underweighted meat in four of them: two Loblaw stores and one Sobeys-owned location, plus a Walmart. Calculated overcharges per item ranged from four to 11 per cent.\n\nThe findings suggest grocers selling underweighted meat is a prevalent and ongoing problem, at a time when shoppers are struggling with high food prices that began rising during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"When you're seeing that they're not weighing meat product properly \u2026 there's an extra hit there that the consumer is taking,\" said Iris Griffin, a shopper who blew the whistle on the 80-store Loblaw case.\n\nIn late November 2023, Griffin, who lives on Hecla Island in Manitoba's Lake Winnipeg, bought a package of ground beef at a Loblaw-owned Superstore in Winnipeg.\n\nThe beef's label stated that its net weight was 1.834 kilograms. But when Griffin weighed the meat in order to freeze equal portions, she said it turned out to be 1.7 kg \u2014 134 grams short.\n\nShe said the weight of the beef's hard plastic tray made up for the missing weight, so she figures the meat had been incorrectly weighed with the packaging.\n\n\"I was angry,\" said Griffin, who calculated she'd been overcharged $1.27 (7.9 per cent) on the $17.35 price tag. \"I'm being charged for this piece of plastic at the price of the ground beef.\"\n\nLoblaw Companies Ltd. spokesperson Catherine Thomas said in an email that due to an error involving a change in packaging, the grocer sold \"a small number\" of underweighted meat products in 80 stores across Western Canada.\n\nShe didn't address questions about when the problem started and how much customers were overcharged.\n\n\"We have robust internal processes and controls in place; however, they are subject to the occasional operational error,\" Thomas said. \"Even though 97 per cent of our [2,400] stores were unaffected, any pricing issue that results in an overcharge is one too many.\" Read more\n\nB.C. court approves class-action lawsuit about privacy over Home Depot receipts\n\nA customer gets a ceiling fan off the shelf at an Atlanta Home Depot in 2005. A B.C. judge has allowed a class-action lawsuit alleging the company gathered information when B.C. customers opted for emailed receipts, including the purchase price, brands bought and data related to the customer's email address, then shared it without consent with technology giant Meta. (John Amis/Associated Press)\n\nA British Columbia Supreme Court judge says a class-action lawsuit alleging Home Depot violated its customers' privacy when collecting and sharing their information after emailing purchase receipts can proceed.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Home Depot gathered information when B.C. customers opted for emailed receipts, including the purchase price, brands bought and data related to the customer's email address, then shared it without consent with technology giant Meta.\n\nJustice Peter Edelmann allowed the certification of the class for the alleged breaches of privacy in a decision posted online Wednesday, but he dismissed claims that Home Depot violated other duties and contractual obligations.\n\nThe certification is not a finding of wrongdoing, and Home Depot did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decision says that Meta, which operates Facebook, offered a service to help the company understand if its advertising campaigns on the social media platform were leading to in-store sales.\n\nThe court document says Home Depot argued customers had no reasonable expectation of privacy because the information shared with Meta was \"high-level\" and less sensitive, but Edelmann disagreed, saying that privacy expectations \"cannot be assessed on a piecemeal basis.\"\n\nThe decision says the claim involves more than six million emails and corresponding data shared with Meta over several years. The judge said the alternative to a class-action lawsuit would be hundreds of thousands of individual claims \"which are simply not feasible.\"\n\n\"The value of the individual claims would also make the costs of litigation prohibitive as individual claimants would be unlikely to recover the actual cost,\" he said.

(Jenny Kane/The Associated Press)\n\nBack in 2010, a 26-year-old Mark Zuckerberg shared his vision for Facebook \u2014 by that point a wildly popular social network with more than 500 million users.\n\n\"The primary thing that we focus on all day long is how to help people share and stay connected with their friends, family and the people in the community around them,\" Zuckerberg told CNBC. \"That's what we care about, and that's why we started the company.\"\n\nFifteen years and three billion users later, Facebook's parent company Meta has a new vision: characters powered by artificial intelligence existing alongside actual friends and family. Some experts caution that this could mark the end of social media as we know it.\n\nFor early users of social media, platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become \"about as anti-social as you can imagine,\" said Carmi Levy, a technology analyst and journalist based in London, Ont. \"It's becoming increasingly difficult to connect with an actual human being.\"\n\nA story published last month by the Financial Times laid out Meta's plans for artificially generated accounts on Facebook and Instagram, each with distinct characteristics, including racial and sexual identities.\n\n\"They'll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content,\" Connor Hayes, Meta's vice-president of product for generative AI, told the paper.\n\nThe corporation started experimenting with them in 2023. After the Times story was published, some irritated users began a campaign to block and report the accounts. One journalist spoke to an AI account that presented itself as a Black queer woman \u2014 and admitted that its development team didn't include any Black people.\n\nMeta recently began quietly removing the profiles, which Meta Canada spokesperson Julia Perreira told CBC News were managed by humans and part of an \"early experiment.\"\n\nThe company deleted the accounts due to a bug that was \"impacting users' abilities to block them,\" said Perreira. \"[We] are removing those accounts to fix the issue,\" she noted, but did not respond to a question about whether the accounts would be reinstated at a later date.

            "content": "I'm certain that many readers have shopped at either Costco Wholesale (COST -3.93%) or Home Depot (HD -4.19%) -- or both -- at least once. These two retailers have generated combined revenue of $407 billion in their latest fiscal years. And over the long term, they have both generated strong returns for shareholders.\n\nIf we view things with a fresh perspective, which of these top retail stocks is the better one to buy right now?\n\nA minimal threat of disruption\n\nInvestors looking for businesses they could hold for the long haul should prioritize companies that have staying power -- ones that face a minimal threat of disruption. Costco and Home Depot fit the bill here.\n\nThese two brick-and-mortar retailers have been around for decades, essentially doing the exact same thing they have always done. For investors, this is compelling because it adds a level of predictability and stability.\n\nContrast that with the constantly changing tech landscape, where making long-term bets can be difficult because it's hard to know how things will shake out. What's more, top talent and huge amounts of capital flow to tech-driven industries, making competition intense.\n\nThat's not the case with the retail sector, particularly for a warehouse club operator like Costco or a home improvement chain like Home Depot. Their dominant industry positions discourage new entrants.\n\nThese two companies aren't remaining static, either. It's quite the opposite approach: Costco and Home Depot have e-commerce operations. And they both use technology in various ways to improve their operations.\n\nNonetheless, I would argue that both businesses will still be around 50 years from now, doing what they currently do.\n\nOne thrives, one struggles\n\nThese two companies should be on every investor's watch list based on their staying power, but they're operating on different wavelengths.\n\nCostco's business is humming along nicely. Net sales rose 5% in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 1, 2024).\n\nAnd it expanded its membership base by 7.3% year over year to 76.2 million in that 52-week period. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported an impressive 90.5% worldwide renewal rate, indicating strong customer retention.\n\nThose memberships provide a high-margin revenue stream for Costco, driving financial performance despite selling merchandise at very low margins. Plus, they encourage customer loyalty and repeat purchases.\n\nAt the same time, Home Depot has hit a bit of a rough patch. Because the business operates adjacent to the housing market, it's been hurt by higher interest rates and the inflationary pressures facing consumers in recent years. Same-store sales are expected to dip 2.5% in fiscal 2024, which ends in a few weeks.\n\nBut Home Depot is the clear leader in its industry, a market that management estimates to be worth $1 trillion. An aging housing stock, coupled with a shortage of housing inventory, should support long-term demand. It also helps that interest rates have been coming down.\n\nPay attention to valuation\n\nOne crucial variable to consider is a stock's valuation. As of this writing, Costco shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 54. The stock has rarely been more expensive in its entire history. That leaves investors with a zero margin of safety.\n\nMost readers would agree that Costco is the superior business out of these two, since it keeps reporting solid financial results no matter the economy. However, paying more than 50 times earnings, no matter how great the company is, looks like a clear mistake. Expectations remain elevated, with the investment community viewing the business very optimistically.\n\nHome Depot, on the other hand, trades at a P/E of 26. Investors have to be patient for things to improve, but this stock is the better buy.",

They just got my uncle, immigration.\n\nThe two had been talking at a Home Depot parking lot, less than a mile down the road from their home in Bakersfield when Border Patrol agents showed up and began asking questions.\n\nInformation about constitutional rights for immigrants was provided at the Robert F. Kennedy High School Auditorium in Delano. (Tomas Ovalle/For The Times)\n\nCasarez dashed to the scene, where she said she saw a dozen agents. \u201cIt was ugly,\u201d she said. They had already taken her husband away.\n\nThe Border Patrol operation near Bakersfield lasted for several days and netted 78 arrests this week, raising alarm bells across the Central Valley, where a largely immigrant workforce helps harvest a quarter of the food grown in the U.S.\n\nImmigrant advocates say it was the largest enforcement operation in the Central Valley in years and fear that it could be a prelude of what\u2019s to come under President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised mass deportations \u2014 a move that many fear will wreak havoc on the region\u2019s agricultural and processing industries.\n\nBorder Patrol confirmed that agents conducted a targeted enforcement operation in Kern County, saying it was aimed at dismantling transnational criminal organizations. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Agent Gregory K. Bovino said in statements on social media that dozens of agents had detained two child rapists and \u201cother criminals,\u201d as well as retrieved 36 pounds of narcotics, as part of Operation Return to Sender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBovino, who leads the agency\u2019s El Centro sector that spans 71 miles of the Imperial Valley along Mexico border, said agents arrested others encountered during the course of the operation who were in the U.S. unlawfully.\n\nIn the small farming towns outside Bakersfield, at gas stations and in the miles and miles of fields, everyone seemed to know about the arrests that had quickly spread across social media, sowing fear among migrant families, many of whom had children or spouses that were born here. And in the panic, even routine law enforcement presence at strip malls and freeway off-ramps was, at times, conflated online with immigration roundups.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the enforcement actions could last; Bovino said agents are planning additional operations in Fresno and Sacramento.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith our border under control in El Centro, we go where the threat is,\u201d Bovino wrote in response to someone on Instagram who said they were puzzled as to why Border Patrol was conducting operations so far north of the border.\n\nThe enforcement has perplexed local immigrant advocates, who questioned why the Biden administration was using its final weeks to target Central Valley migrant workers for deportation.\n\nJay Tamsi provides information after a presentation by a consortium of attorneys, organizations, and community experts explaining constitutional rights for immigrants at the Robert F. Kennedy High School Auditorium in Delano. (Tomas Ovalle/For The Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI understand you\u2019ve got to protect the border,\u201d said Manuel Cunha Jr., president of Nisei Farmers League, which represents agricultural employers and their workers. \u201cStay out of our farms. Go after the cartels \u2014 do your raids on those people.\u201d\n\nGrowers reported that workers had stayed home out of fear of being arrested, he said.\n\nThe consequences of the operation, he fears, could ricochet across the economy that powers farms, dairies and food processing plants. Grape vines and trees will lose their crop if they aren\u2019t pruned in time. Cows could die if workers don\u2019t show up to milk them.\n\n\u201cIt does have effects on the food chain, without any question,\u201d Cunha said. \u201cBut it has the greatest effect on those families because they can\u2019t feed their children if they can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nCasarez said she knew many people afraid to leave their house. A friend\u2019s daughter hurt her arm at school. The woman was so scared to take her to the hospital that Casarez offered to accompany her.\n\nJust a day before her husband was detained, she had met with a lawyer so that they could fix his legal status. He had been in the country for more than a decade working in construction.\n\nThe attorney, Parvin Wiliani, spent the next three days searching for him. She asked not to share his name out of fear of retaliation.\n\nTwo women hug before a forum about constitutional rights for immigrants was presented in Delano. (Tomas Ovalle/For The Times)\n\n\u201cHe is the sole provider for the family and nobody knew his whereabouts,\u201d she said. When she called the local field office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which usually holds detainees, she was told he wasn\u2019t there. She then called at least half a dozen ICE processing centers along with Customs and Border Patrol detention centers. Nothing. It took three days before his name even popped in the system.\n\nWiliani said she only learned then that he was being held in \u201can unknown location\u201d near the border. \u201cThat\u2019s very unusual. I can normally locate my clients within 24 hours.\u201d\n\nOther immigration attorneys reported similar issues, adding to the collective anxiety. Throughout the week immigrants filled community rooms as advocates held packed sessions with attorneys and offering legal support in case they were pulled over or detained by agents.\n\nCarina Sanchez, attended one of those meetings in Delano, with her 5-year-old son. As a counselor at a nearby elementary school, she said many of the students or their parents don\u2019t have legal status.\n\n\u201cIt makes me think about my kids, my students.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly how many people have been detained, where they were held or why agents from El Centro were conducting operations so far away from the border. And Border Patrol would not provide details.\n\nBorder Patrol has authority to conduct vehicle searches within 100 miles of the U.S. boundary. Bakersfield is more than 200 miles from the border but about 100 air miles from the coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElected officials from both sides of the political aisle expressed concern about the enforcement action.\n\nBakersfield Mayor Karen Goh, a Republican, said that cartel members engaging in criminal activity \u2014 whom she understood to be the focus of the operation \u2014 should fear arrest. But she expressed concern for \u201cpersons who are unnecessarily in fear.\u201d\n\nField organizer Erika Brooks gets information from experts at the Robert F. Kennedy High School Auditorium in Delano. (Tomas Ovalle/For The Times)\n\n\u201cI am extremely concerned that these arrests may have taken place at random, or based on racial profiling,\u201d said state Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula (D-Fresno). \u201cEveryone in our state and nation deserves to be treated with dignity and respect \u2014 everyone is entitled to due process and constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) said Customs and Border Protection had told him they were apprehending criminals or those with ties to criminal organizations.\n\n\u201cI urge the Biden administration to ensure CBP is prioritizing criminals and not those responsible for producing our nation\u2019s food supply,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urgently need common-sense immigration reform that creates a pathway to earned legal status for hardworking individuals contributing to our economy and removes those who threaten the safety of our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Farm Workers Foundation urged residents, if detained, to exercise their right to remain silent before they speak with an attorney. Ambar Tovar, directing attorney for the organization, said the community was reeling from days of mounting fear and uncertainty.\n\nTovar questioned whether border agents were meeting the legal standard for reasonable suspicion required for such stops without a warrant and said she plans to investigate whether Border Patrol officers had jurisdiction as far inland as some of the stops they conducted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to stop a car full of farmworkers on their way to work,\u201d she said.\n\nLate Thursday, a border agent called Wiliani.\n\n\u201cHe told me he got an order to call me and then he let my client talk to me,\u201d she said. He was still in a processing center somewhere in Imperial County but would be released the next day, when he called Casarez to tell her that he had a bus ticket to come home.\n\n\u201cHe was free,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a joy.\u201d",

Agents in unmarked SUVs rounded up people in vans outside a Home Depot and gas station that serves a breakfast popular with field workers.\n\nThis appears to be the first large-scale Border Patrol raid in California since the election of Donald Trump, coming just a day after Congress certified the election on January 6, in the final days of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The panic and confusion, for both immigrants and local businesses that rely on their labor, foreshadow what awaits communities across California if Trump follows through on his promise to conduct mass deportations.\n\n\u201cIt was profiling; it was purely field workers,\u201d said Sara Fuentes, store manager of the local gas station. Fuentes said that at 9 a.m., when the store typically gets a rush of workers on their way to pick oranges, two men in civilian clothes and unmarked Suburbans started detaining people outside the store. \u201cThey didn\u2019t stop people with FedEx uniforms. They were stopping people who looked like they worked in the fields.\u201d Fuentes says one customer pulled in just to pump gas and agents approached him and detained him.\n\nFuentes says none of the regular farmworkers showed up to buy breakfast on Wednesday morning. \u201cNo field workers at all,\u201d she said.\n\nGrowers and agricultural leaders in California and across the nation have warned that Trump\u2019s promised mass deportations will disrupt the nation\u2019s food supply, leading to shortages and higher prices. In Kern County this week, just the word of the deportations inspired workers to stay away from the fields.\n\n\u201cPeople are freaked out. People are worried. People are planning on staying home the next couple of days,\u201d said Antonio De Loera-Brust, director of communication for the United Farm Workers. De Loera-Brust said the Border Patrol detained at least one UFW member in Kern County as they \u201ctraveled between home and work.\u201d\n\nVideos shared in local Facebook groups and Instagram pages show Border Patrol agents pulling over vehicles along the 99 Highway on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bakersfield.\n\n\u201cThey were stopping cars at random, asking people for papers. They were going to gas stations and Home Depot where day laborers gather,\u201d De Loera-Brust said. \u201cIt\u2019s provoking intense anxiety and a lot of fear in the community.\u201d\n\nIf this is the new normal, this is absolute economic devastation. Richard S. Gearhart, associate professor of economics at Cal State-Bakersfield\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment. On social media, Gregory K. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief in El Centro, called the sweeps \u201cOperation Return to Sender.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are taking it to the bad people and bad things in Bakersfield,\u201d the El Centro Border Patrol said in response to a comment on its Facebook page. \u201cWe are planning operations for other locals (sic) such as Fresno and especially Sacramento.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people have been detained by Border Patrol or how long the operation would last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of our citrus harvesting. This sent shockwaves through the entire community,\u201d Casey Creamer, president of the industry group California Citrus Mutual, said Thursday. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to work and kids aren\u2019t going to school. Yesterday, about 25% of the workforce, today 75% didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\nHe pushed back on the Border Patrol\u2019s claims they\u2019re targeting bad people. He said they appeared to be general sweeps of workers.\n\n\u201cIf this is the new normal, this is absolute economic devastation,\u201d said Richard S. Gearhart, an associate professor of economics at Cal State-Bakersfield.\n\nIn the short term, he predicted farms and dairies could make up the losses, but that homebuilders, restaurants and small businesses would be the most hurt financially.\n\nBut he\u2019s worried about the long term.\n\n\u201cYou are talking about a recession-level event if this is the new long-term norm,\u201d he said.\n\nAgriculture comprises about 10% of Kern County\u2019s gross domestic product, and undocumented workers may comprise half of the workforce, he said. And the Central Valley provides about a quarter of the United States\u2019 food.\n\n\u201cSo, you WILL see, in the long run, food inflation and food shortages,\u201d he wrote in a text message.\n\nHe predicted immigrants, even ones with documents, would stop shopping, going to school and seeking health care.\n\n\u201cSo, this could have some serious deleterious long-run impacts beyond lost farm productivity. Losses in education and health would be catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, you know how Kern County complains about oil? This event would be analogous to shutting down oil production. Economic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nRelated",

This EPS growth is lower than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Home Depot's TSR for the last 5 years was 88%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nHome Depot provided a TSR of 12% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 13% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Home Depot you should know about.",

Agents in unmarked SUVs rounded up people in vans outside a Home Depot and gas station that serves a breakfast popular with field workers.\n\nThis appears to be the first large-scale Border Patrol raid in California since the election of Donald Trump, coming just a day after Congress certified the election on January 6, in the final days of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The panic and confusion, for both immigrants and local businesses that rely on their labor, foreshadow what awaits communities across California if Trump follows through on his promise to conduct mass deportations.\n\n\u201cIt was profiling, it was purely field workers,\u201d said Sara Fuentes, store manager of the local gas station. Fuentes said that at 9 a.m., when the store typically gets a rush of workers on their way to pick oranges, two men in civilian clothes and unmarked Suburbans started detaining people outside the store. \u201cThey didn\u2019t stop people with FedEx uniforms, they were stopping people who looked like they worked in the fields.\u201d Fuentes says one customer pulled in just to pump gas and agents approached him and detained him.\n\nFuentes has lived in Bakersfield all her life and says she\u2019s never seen anything like it. In one instance, she said a man and woman drove up to the store together, and the man went inside. Border Patrol detained the man as he walked out, Fuentes said, and then demanded the woman get out of the vehicle. When she refused, another agency parked his vehicle behind the woman, blocking her car. Fuentes said it wasn\u2019t until the local Univision station showed up that Border Patrol agents backed up their car and allowed the woman to leave.\n\nVideo courtesy of Sara Fuentes\n\nFuentes says none of the regular farm workers showed up to buy breakfast on Wednesday morning. \u201cNo field workers at all,\u201d she said. Growers and agricultural leaders in California and across the nation have warned that Trump\u2019s promised mass deportations will disrupt the nation\u2019s food supply, leading to shortages and higher prices. In Kern County this week, just the word of the deportations inspired workers to stay away from the fields. \u201cPeople are freaked out, people are worried, people are planning on staying home the next couple of days,\u201d said Antonio De Loera-Brust, director of communication for the United Farm Workers. De Loera-Brust said the Border Patrol detained at least one UFW member in Kern County as they \u201ctraveled between home and work.\u201d Videos shared in local Facebook groups and Instagram pages show Border Patrol agents pulling over vehicles along the 99 Highway on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bakersfield.\n\n\u201cThey were stopping cars at random, asking people for papers. They were going to gas stations and Home Depot where day laborers gather,\u201d said Antonio De Loera-Brust. \u201cIt\u2019s provoking intense anxiety and a lot of fear in the community.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment. On social media, Gregory K. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief in El Centro, called the sweeps \u201cOperation Return to Sender.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are taking it to the bad people and bad things in Bakersfield,\u201d the El Centro Border Patrol said in response to a comment on its Facebook page. \u201cWe are planning operations for other locals (sic) such as Fresno and especially Sacramento.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection patch on the uniform of an agent in the Jacumba mountains in Imperial County on Oct. 6, 2022. Photo by Allison Dinner, AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people have been detained by Border Patrol or how long the operation would last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of our citrus harvesting. This sent shockwaves through the entire community,\u201d said Casey Creamer, president of the industry group California Citrus Mutual, on Thursday. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to work and kids aren\u2019t going to school. Yesterday about 25% of the workforce, today 75% didn\u2019t show up.\u201d\n\nHe pushed back on the Border Patrol\u2019s claims they\u2019re targeting bad people. He said they appeared to be general sweeps of workers.\n\n\u201cIf this is the new normal, this is absolute economic devastation,\u201d said Richard S. Gearhart, an associate professor of economics at Cal State-Bakersfield.\n\nIn the short term, he predicted farms and dairies could make up the losses, but that homebuilders, restaurants and small businesses would be most hurt financially.\n\nBut he\u2019s worried about the long-term.\n\n\u201cYou are talking about a recession-level event if this is the new long-term norm,\u201d he said.\n\nAgriculture comprises about 10 percent of Kern County\u2019s gross domestic product and undocumented workers may comprise half of the workforce, he said. And the Central Valley provides about a quarter of the United States\u2019 food.\n\n\u201cSo, you WILL see, in the long run, food inflation and food shortages,\u201d he wrote in a text message.\n\nHe predicted immigrants, even ones with documents, would stop shopping, going to school and seeking health care.\n\n\u201cSo, this could have some serious deleterious long run impacts beyond lost farm productivity. Losses in education and health would be catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, you know how Kern County complains about oil? This event would be analogous to shutting down oil production. Economic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nFor the record: The first paragraph of this story has been updated to reflect that orange groves went unpicked. The original version referred to grape fields.

Supreme Court has certified a class action against Home Depot over allegations that it violated the privacy rights of its customers when it shared their email address and details of their purchases with social media giant Meta Platforms, Inc.In Hvitved v. Home Depot of Canada Inc., 2025 BCSC 18, released on Jan. 7, Justice Peter Edelmann rejected arguments that the home improvement giant's customers had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the email addresses and purchase data shared with Meta, which owns social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\u201cA reasonable expectation of privacy cannot be assessed on a piecemeal basis, looking at each element of data in isolation,\u201d the judge wrote, noting that the plaintiff had alleged that Home Depot had sent the data to Meta for the purpose of it being correlated and connected to Meta profiles.Between October 2018 and October 2022, Home Depot gave customers shopping in person at its stores the option of receiving their transaction receipt by email.Home Depot shared some of this information with Meta, including a hashed string of characters encoding the customer's email address, the dates and times of their purchases and the sales dollar amount.The retailer shared the data in order to use an offline conversions tool service provided by Meta that compares advertisements on Facebook with real-world outcomes such as in-store purchases.The plaintiff, Lasse Hvitved, alleged that Home Depot breached various privacy statutes, common law duties and contractual obligations when it collected the relevant personal information and shared it with Meta, a third party.He further alleged that Home Depot was also unjustly enriched as a result of the breaches.Home Depot argued that it did not violate the relevant customers\u2019 privacy as they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the data shared with Meta.It argued that the high-level information shared with Meta about each purchase, including the date, amount, and the general department of the purchase, are even less sensitive than what appears on the face of a tossed-out receipt.The defendant submitted that this data would have been apparent to any members of the public who saw the customer making the in-store purchase.Home Depot also argued that under case law there is no privacy interest in contact information like an email address.Justice Edelmann held it was not evident that the data in question could have been compiled and used in the manner described by someone observing an in-store purchase.\u201cIn particular, it is not clear that the email address would have been visible to a person observing the transaction,\u201d the judge wrote.He added that even if the court accepted the argument that there is a limited expectation of privacy in an email address on its own, the allegation was that the email address allowed information about in-store purchases to be connected to a Meta profile.The judge noted that the plaintiff had pleaded that Home Depot\u2019s customers had a reasonable expectation that their purchase data would not be compiled and shared with Meta to be used not only to generate marketing information for Home Depot but also for Meta\u2019s own marketing purposes.The court held that the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded the violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy.Justice Edelmann also found that the cause of action for a wilful violation of privacy had been sufficiently pleaded and that the allegations of wilful collection and subsequent sharing of personal information, along with false denials that such sharing took place, sufficiently set out an arguable case for punitive damages.The plaintiff also pleaded that Home Depot breached the contracts customers entered into with Home Depot when they made purchases in a store.He argued that an in-store purchase creates a contract between the customer and the seller and that at it was an express term of the contract that Home Depot would use the email addresses only to provide an electronic receipt.The plaintiff further submitted that it was an express or implied term of the contract that Home Depot would be responsible for all the personal information of class members under its control and would take appropriate measures to ensure that personal information would not be disclosed to third parties without consent.Home Depot submitted that the pleadings did not set out the nature of the contracts, whether they were oral or written, or even where one would find the express terms of the contract.The court cited Lam v. Flo Health Inc., 2024 BCSC 391 in which the B.C. Supreme Court held that it is inappropriate to plead implied terms in the alternative as a safeguard if express terms are not found to exist.Justice Edelmann found that the cause of action in contract had not been made out in pleadings.With respect to the cause of action in unjust enrichment, the plaintiff had alleged that Home Depot was enriched by the economic value it obtained from providing the personal information to Meta and the class members suffered a corresponding deprivation of the opportunity to sell their personal information to Home Depot or Meta.The plaintiff also submitted that there was no juristic reason for the enrichment.Justice Edelmann noted that the plaintiff had not pleaded any material facts about the alleged opportunity to sell the data in question to Home Depot or Meta.The court noted that counsel for the plaintiff had in oral submissions suggested that individuals are regularly provided opportunities to exchange the use of personal information for material benefits such as rebates, merchandise or services through loyalty card programs.\u201cHowever, there is no suggestion in the pleadings nor in the evidence before me that Home Depot or Meta were willing to pay class members for the use of the data at issue, whether through a loyalty card programme or some other mechanism,\u201d the judge wrote.The judge also observed that the pleading did not suggest a loss of opportunity to sell the data to any other party and that there was no evidence that Home Depot or Meta were willing to pay class members for the use of the data at issue.The judge added that the economic value of the \u201copportunity to sell\u201d the data would also be premised on the willingness of the individuals in question to sell.He observed that in previous cases decided by the court that the loss suffered by individuals who would not have sold their data is non-pecuniary.The judge held that a cause of action of unjust enrichment had not been made out on the pleadings.\u201cIn conclusion, the plaintiff\u2019s application for certification is allowed in relation to the alleged breaches of provincial privacy legislation. The other causes of action are struck,\u201d the judge wrote.The court certified the action as a class action on behalf of all residents of Canada who, from Jan. 1, 2018 to Oct. 31, 2022, made a purchase at a Home Depot store anywhere in Canada, excluding Quebec, and provided their email address for the purpose of receiving an electronic receipt.Home Depot declined to comment on the decision.\u201cWe value and respect our customers\u2019 privacy and are committed to the responsible collection and use of information. We aren\u2019t able to comment on ongoing litigation,\u201d a Home Depot spokesperson told Law360 Canada.Counsel for the parties were not immediately available for comment.Counsel for the plaintiff were Chelsea Hermanson, Jamie Thornback and Brenna Krause (articled student) at Camp Fiorante Matthews Mogerman LLP.Counsel for the defendant were Alexandra Cocks and Connor Bildfell of McCarthy T\u00e9trault LLP.If you have any information, story ideas, or news tips for Law360 Canada on business-related law and litigation, including class actions, please contact Karunjit Singh at karunjit.singh@lexisnexis.ca or 905-415-5859.",

Her journey\u2014from being a professional dancer and business owner to becoming the oldest employee at Home Depot in the US \u2014 is one of resilience. With a life filled with movement, creativity, and optimism, Wilson shares her simple yet profound tips for living a long, fulfilling life.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nA Life Beyond Retirement: Rediscovering Purpose\n\nHaving retired three times, each for a decade, Wilson found that retirement wasn\u2019t as satisfying as expected. \u201cI got so tired of myself,\u201d she explains, which led her to rejoin the workforce to reconnect with society and find joy in interacting with customers. Now, as a cashier working two mornings a week from 6 am to 10 am, she thrives on the camaraderie of her job. Wilson celebrated her 100th birthday with fun, enjoying a grand party with 80 guests and another celebration hosted by Home Depot.\n\nWilson\u2019s independence and autonomy is the cornerstone of her lifestyle. She lives alone, drives herself to work and for errands, and cooks her own meals. While she hires help for cleaning and yard work, her rationale is simple: \u201cI could do it, but I don\u2019t want to. By getting this old, I got a little smart, too.\u201d\n\nStaying Active: Movement as Medicine\n\nA former professional dancer, Wilson emphasises the importance of staying active. With a career that included rhythm tap performances with the June Taylor dancers and owning a dance academy for 37 years, movement has been central to her life. Even at 100, she continues to dance, often grooving to music played on her Alexa. To maintain posture, she regularly stands against a wall to check for slouching.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHealthy Eating: Adapting to Challenges\n\nWilson has adapted her diet to meet health challenges while enjoying what she eats. After a cancer diagnosis, she reduced sugar consumption based on advice from her oncologist. High cholesterol led her to cut out bacon and cheese, focusing instead on lean proteins like chicken, fish, and steak, while avoiding white flour. She cooks most of her meals, ensuring they are both nutritious and satisfying.\n\nBalancing Indulgence with Discipline\n\nDespite her healthy habits, Wilson doesn\u2019t shy away from occasional treats. A chocolate cake and ice cream is always in her freezer, though she indulges sparingly\u2014a slice of cake once a week or a tablespoon of ice cream occasionally. Her approach to sweets highlights the importance of moderation and self-control.\n\nBeyond dancing, Wilson nurtures her creativity through various outlets. She enjoys singing, painting, and has even written a cookbook. Her Instagram page showcases her artwork, reflecting her zest for life and self-expression.\n\nOptimism and Emotional Resilience\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWilson attributes her longevity to a positive outlook and emotional resilience. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff,\u201d she advises, emphasizing the importance of releasing anger and embracing optimism. For her, positivity is less taxing than negativity and fosters a sense of well-being.\n\nAs she continues to thrive, Wilson is the ultimate mantra of living life to the fullest, proving that a fulfilling, vibrant life is attainable at any age.",

Rather, the business gave Meta access to those emails in order to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads. Consumers allege that this behavior went beyond their contractual duties and privacy laws.\n\nHome Depot allegedly gave Meta access to about 7 million consumer emails between 2018 and 2022. Meta's ad analytics tool utilized these emails to track in-store transactions affected by internet advertisements by connecting Facebook profiles. The goal of Meta's initiative was to quantify offline buying patterns influenced by online advertising.\n\nHome Depot said it was aware that once the analysis was finished, Meta would remove the \"hashed\" email data. However, an examination by the Ontario Privacy Commissioner (OPC) in 2021 revealed that the businesses had not properly obtained user authorization before sharing this data.\n\nWhen a complaint attempted to remove his Facebook account, he found the problem. He discovered that a record of his Home Depot transactions was in Meta's possession. In 2022, Home Depot stopped the practice in response to the OPC's recommendations.\n\nCustomers who gave their email addresses at Home Depot locations between May 1, 2018, and October 31, 2022, are seeking reimbursement in the class action, which is being sponsored by Merchant Law Group. The case can go to trial because of the BC Supreme Court's certification.\n\nThe sitting court placed a strong emphasis on resolving these pervasive privacy concerns. \"The contemporary business landscape involves the use of personal information,\" the judge wrote, \"each individual may have limited ability to protect their rights.\"\n\nAll impacted clients in Canada are eligible to participate in this case.

Home Depot\u2019s fiscal 2024 revenues are projected to grow 3.9% year over year to $158.6 billion and EPS is expected to increase 0.1% year over year to $15.12. HD\u2019s EPS estimates for fiscal 2024 moved up 0.7% in the last 60 days. Home Depot\u2019s annual earnings are slated to increase 3.4% year over year to $163.9 billion in fiscal 2025, with EPS anticipated to expand 3.5% to $15.65 per share.\n\nHome Depot and Lowe\u2019s have been competing for the top spot in the home improvement market for more than a decade. While these companies target the same set of customers with similar product lines, there is a stark contrast in their sizes, branding and supply-chain strategies. Commanding a market cap of $381.7 billion, Home Depot is much bigger compared with Lowe\u2019s, which has a market cap of $139.2 billion. Home Depot holds the lead with a market share of approximately 47%, whereas Lowe\u2019s commands around 28%. In fiscal 2023, HD reported revenues of $152.7 billion compared with Lowe\u2019s $86.4 billion. Despite Home Depot\u2019s dominance, Lowe\u2019s has been narrowing the gap in recent years through targeted strategies.\n\nBeing the two dominant players in the home improvement retail market, The Home Depot Inc. HD and Lowe\u2019s Companies Inc. LOW have consistently captured the attention of investors. HD and LOW are both highly credible names in the home improvement sector, with decades of experience and strong reputations. Home Depot\u2019s credibility is bolstered by its expansive Pro customer network and consistent operational excellence. Its scale and efficiency have made it the go-to choice for contractors and large-scale projects. Lowe\u2019s credibility is rooted in its focus on DIY customers and personalized service. Its efforts to cater to homeowners through tailored product offerings and localized strategies have resonated well with its target demographic. Additionally, Lowe\u2019s partnerships and initiatives to enhance customer experience have strengthened its standing in the market. Stepping into 2025, let us dive into the two companies\u2019 key statistics, market share, valuation, dividend strategies and stock performances to determine which is better positioned for growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, Lowe\u2019s fiscal 2024 revenues are expected to decline 3.5% year over year to $83.3 billion and EPS is likely to fall 10% to $11.88. LOW\u2019s EPS estimates for fiscal 2024 have moved down 0.7% in the past 60 days. Lowe\u2019s annual earnings are slated to increase 1.1% to $84.3 billion in fiscal 2025, with EPS anticipated to expand 5.7% to $12.56 per share.\n\nLOW Earnings Estimate Revision Trend\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, we can clearly see that Home Depot has seen analysts raising estimates, while LOW witnessed a downtrend in estimate revisions. Moreover, HD\u2019s estimates indicate year-over-year increases in revenues and earnings for this year, whereas LOW\u2019s estimates suggest declines.\n\nLOW, HD Stock Performance & Valuation Comparison\n\nOver the last year, Lowe\u2019s stock had the edge in terms of performance, with LOW having a total return of more than 13%, including dividends. This has noticeably lagged the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s return of +26% but has topped Home Depot\u2019s 11% growth.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, the performances of these home improvement giants have also vastly trailed the broader Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s total return of +31%.\n\nHD-LOW One-Year Stock Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, HD and LOW have similar forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples. Home Depot trades at 24.6X, which is above its 5-year median of 22.07X, and Lowe\u2019s is trading at 19.71X, above its 5-year median of 17.45X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale currently trades at a 24.8X forward P/E multiple, which is essentially above the multiples of Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. Hence, both companies look relatively cheaper than the broader sector.\n\n\n\nHome Depot and Lowe\u2019s currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nLOW vs. HD: Dividend Analysis\n\nApart from stability and growth potential, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s tend to attract investors with their strong record of paying regular dividends. These companies have consistently raised dividend payouts, reflecting their confidence in their earnings growth potential.\n\n\n\nHome Depot offers a dividend yield of 2.3%, supported by a payout ratio of 60%, signaling a balance between rewarding shareholders and reinvesting in the business. HD has a five-year dividend growth rate of 11.2%. (Check HD\u2019s dividend history here)\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s, with a dividend yield of 1.8% and a lower payout ratio of 39%, provides more room for dividend growth. LOW has a five-year dividend growth rate of 20.3%. (Check LOW\u2019s dividend history here.)\n\nVerdict: HD vs. LOW Stock\n\nWhile Home Depot boasts a larger market share, higher revenues and a more established Pro customer base, Lowe\u2019s is closing the gap with growth initiatives and cost efficiencies. For conservative investors seeking stability, Home Depot remains the safer bet. However, those with a higher risk tolerance might find Lowe\u2019s a compelling choice for potential upside in 2025.\n\n\n\nBoth companies are well-positioned for growth, but the better choice ultimately depends on individual investment goals and risk preferences.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unfortunately its return of 72% is below the market return of 93%.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver half a decade, Home Depot managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.8% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nDive deeper into Home Depot's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Home Depot's .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Home Depot, it has a TSR of 95% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nHome Depot provided a TSR of 14% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 14% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against other best home appliance stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOverview of the US Home Appliance Industry\n\nThe home appliance industry is likely to continue flourishing as long as people continue buying homes and relying on technology to make their daily tasks easier. According to Grand View Research, the household appliances market in the US was valued at $58.33 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% between 2024 and 2030. One of the primary driving forces behind this growth is the rise in the disposable income levels of consumers. In addition, the rapid pace of urbanization is also a pivotal factor behind the market\u2019s expansion.\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the United States\u2019 major home appliances market is expected to have a market size of $34.42 billion in 2025. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2.93% between 2025 and 2030, reaching $39.77 billion at the end of the forecast period. The growing economic pressure and changing consumer lifestyles are the primary reasons behind the growth in the major home appliances market in the US.\n\nIn addition, the rising penetration of distribution channels such as brand outlets, supermarkets, specialty stores, and e-commerce is contributing to this growth. The demand for primary household appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, and mixer grinders is significantly increasing due to consumers\u2019 busy and sedentary lifestyles. Another report by Mordor Intelligence shows that the overall US home appliance market size will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3% between 2025 and 2030, reflecting similar trends.\n\nTrends in the US Home Appliance Market\n\nA prominent trend emerging in the home appliance industry is people opting to purchase home appliances directly from manufacturers instead of using traditional middlemen. According to PWC\u2019s June 2023 Global Consumer Insights Pulse Survey, a majority of customers, around 63%, reported buying products directly from a brand\u2019s website. This number is expected to rise in the coming years, as around 29% of the consumers stated that while they hadn\u2019t yet adopted this trend, they were thinking about going direct-to-consumer.\n\nThe US Appliance Satisfaction study conducted by J.D. Power in 2023 showed that around 75% of appliance purchases occurred on the first store visit. In addition, nearly 71%, or three-fourths of home appliance transactions, took place in-store. Although 29% of the purchases occurred online, a majority of consumers still preferred seeing the equipment in person before buying it.\n\nIn 2023, Christina Cooley, home intelligence lead at J.D. Power, stated:\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s data shows us that 56% of home appliance shoppers are doing their research online before heading in-store to purchase. Though price is almost always going to be the main driver of whether someone decides to purchase an appliance or not, one-third of buyers did not purchase because they were seeking specific options and features, and one-fifth indicated they couldn\u2019t purchase, as their desired appliance wasn\u2019t in stock.\u201d\n\nWill the Growth of the Housing Market Affect the Home Appliance Industry?\n\nAccording to Mordor Intelligence, the US housing sector is likely to generate growing demand for home appliances. It is, thus, a prominent driving force behind the industry\u2019s future growth prospects. Development of the housing sector and improvement in people\u2019s living conditions have a direct positive effect on the growth of the home appliance market. Therefore, a growing housing sector in the US is expected to trigger growth in the country\u2019s home appliance market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 home appliance stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 2, 2025. The list is sorted in ascending order of analyst upside.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nAnalyst Upside: 15.68%\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a home improvement retailer that offers a range of home appliances and other home improvement products. The company also offers home installation services and tool and equipment rental. It operates around 2,345 stores throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico and territories of the US Virgin Islands, Canada, Guam, and Mexico. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) primarily serves two customer groups: Professional Customers (Pros) and do-it-yourself (DIY) Customers.\n\nThe company is one of the leaders in DIY home improvement, and made $40.2 billion in sales in fiscal Q3 2024, experiencing a 6.6% increase from the same period last year. This growth was attributed to increased engagement across seasonal goods in certain outdoor projects. However, the company\u2019s same-store sales fell 1.3% compared to fiscal Q3 2023. The home improvement market in North America was estimated to be worth $667 billion in 2023, and is anticipated to reach $1.2 trillion by 2032. Although The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is expected to benefit from this growing market, the results of this growth may take longer to materialize due to a slowdown in customer spending.\n\nIts larger remodeling projects are experiencing increasing pressure due to the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rate environment. Despite the continued uncertainty, the company expects its sales for fiscal 2024 to increase by around 4%. To drive growth, it is focusing on improving its interconnected experience and promoting store expansion. It opened five new stores in fiscal Q3 2024, and expects to open 12 more in fiscal 2024. It ranks tenth on our list of the 10 best home appliance stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOverall, HD ranks 10th on our list of best home appliance stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of home appliance stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "It\u2019s a new year. That means there are new Ryobi BOGO deals and discounts at the Home Depot. One of the best parts of these deals, I mean the best part is getting free stuff, but another great thing is that with most of these, you can pick it out online and then pick it up in the store the same day. But, if it isn\u2019t in stock locally, or you don\u2019t feel like heading down to your local store, you can still get it shipped straight to your front door.\n\nBOGO sales aren\u2019t anything new for either Ryobi or Home Depot. So let\u2019s look at what\u2019s going on this week. The free tools in the offer range from the least expensive Handheld Cordless Vacuum, which retails for $34.97 and up to $79.00 for the Reciprocating Saw, Oscillating Multi-Tool, or Power Scrubber. I know we\u2019re all tempted to immediately chose the tool with the highest price. But I would urge you to forget the price and consider utility instead. What are you going to get the most use from?\n\nThe Oscillating tool may be one of the higher priced tools. It might just sit in your cabinet for those who don\u2019t do much work around. the house. If you mostly work on cars, the Angle Grinder that retails for $59.97 may be the better choice for you. If you already have most of the power tools you need, you may want to get a free 2.0Ah battery.\n\nPick one of these tools when you buy one of the discounted Ryobi bundles.\n\nWe know what you get free, so what do you buy to get the free tool? There are two deals, both offering savings on the combo itself. The first is a ONE+ 18V Lithium-ion Starter Kit for $99.00. If you\u2019re new to Ryobi or need to stock up on battery packs, this is a great choice. You get a 2.0Ah and a 4.0Ah battery along with a charger. The retail price for the three times is $203.94, plus you get to pick a free tool, so that\u2019s a great deal.\n\nRYOBI ONE+ 18V Lithium-Ion Starter Kit: 2.0Ah, 4.0 Ah Battery, and Charger for $99.00 See It\n\nYour other choice to take advantage of the BOGO offer is $149.00. With that, you\u2019re getting a Drill Driver, an Impact Driver, two 2.0Ah battery packs, a charger, and a tool bag. Both of the tools and the batteries in this kit go for 50 to 60 bucks apiece. I have a hard time assigning much value to the charger or the bag, but they\u2019re nice to get. Ryobi says this an \u201cover $400 value,\u201d which I think is pretty optimistic. Realistically, all of this stuff is normally a little over 200 bucks, plus you\u2019re getting a free tool, so this is worth taking advantage of.\n\nMore Ryobi BOGO Deals and Discounts\n\nRYOBI ONE+ HP 18V Brushless 1/2in.

The judge said the alternative to a class-action lawsuit would be hundreds of thousands of individual claims \"which are simply not feasible.\"\n\n\"The value of the individual claims would also make the costs of litigation prohibitive as individual claimants would be unlikely to recover the actual cost,\" he said.\n\n\"The pleading, as I understand it, is that Home Depot\u2019s customers had a reasonable expectation that their purchase data would not be compiled and shared with Meta to be used not only to generate marketing information for Home Depot but also for Meta\u2019s own marketing purposes, including user profiling and targeted advertising unrelated to Home Depot.\"\n\nThe decision says other class-action proceedings making similar allegations have also been launched in Quebec and Saskatchewan.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAshley Joannou, The Canadian Press",

Hagerstown Police thanked the following retailers for their cooperation: Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart, Target, Martin's, Weis, Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Belk, the release states.\n\nSo far, 57 people have been arrested or charged during the first phase of the investigation. Charges include misdemeanor theft, felony theft, vehicle theft, firearms possession and drug possession.\n\nTwo people arrested during the initiative, and two of the handguns recovered, \"were linked to a homicide in another jurisdiction,\" the release states.\n\nThat is a Maryland homicide, but authorities could not release additional information about that case yet because the investigation is still ongoing, according to Greg Alton, Washington County coordinator for the Maryland Criminal Intelligence Network Initiative.\n\nHow much snow did Hagerstown get?: See the latest snowfall totals and forecast\n\nThe investigation aimed to identify repeat offenders who steal from multiple retailers, determine where the stolen property was being sold, and identify the drug networks and organizations supplying drugs to the people doing the thefts, according to Hagerstown Police.\n\nDetectives and uniformed officers did surveillance at retail stores and of known offenders during the six-month operation that continued through December.\n\nAlton estimated that the local total estimated value of items stolen from retailers during that six-month period is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Retail theft is a huge problem locally, just as it is across the country, Alton said in an email.\n\nThe local operation was done under the Maryland Criminal Intelligence Network Initiative. The network \"focuses on identifying, disrupting, and dismantling gangs and violent criminal networks involved in the distribution of illegal drugs, the use of firearms in crimes of violence, human trafficking, or other inherently violent criminal enterprises, through enforcement, prevention, intervention, and information sharing,\" the release states. The network \"seeks to reduce violent crime by facilitating the formation of information technology-enabled partnerships that lead to the improved investigation and prosecution of violent criminals and their networks.\"",

            "content": "While all stores are required to allow service animals, not all stores have to allow pets on their properties. So, it\u2019s important to check with a store or franchise\u2019s pet policy before letting your pet accompany you inside. Make sure to contact the store location directly as some locations of the same franchise may welcome pets while others don\u2019t.\n\nFortunately, there are many different stores that aren\u2019t pet stores that allow customers to bring their cats. Here are some pet-friendly stores in the US that you can visit with your cats.\n\nThe 20 Pet-Friendly Stores in the US\n\n1. Ace Hardware\n\nAce Hardware proudly refers to itself as \u201cthe helpful place\u201d and is a reliable home improvement chain that sells many products manufactured by reputable brands. Most Ace Hardware stores allow leashed dogs inside and don\u2019t mind when dogs are in their outdoor gardening and patio spaces.\n\nThey also welcome other pets, including cats, as long as they\u2019re in a carrier.\n\n2. Apple Store\n\nMost standalone Apple Stores welcome leashed dogs or cats that you can carry in bags or backpacks. Apple Stores that don\u2019t welcome pets are usually located inside malls that have a no-animal policy. Just make sure that your cat is on their best behavior inside an Apple Store as an energetic cat may end up causing damage to very expensive products and equipment.\n\n3. Barnes & Noble\n\nSome Barnes & Noble stores allow leashed dogs and cats inside, so it\u2019s important to first check with your local store\u2019s individual pet policy. If your local Barnes & Noble does allow cats, make sure to avoid going near the caf\u00e9 as an act of courtesy. People may not prefer having cats near them while they\u2019re eating, especially if it\u2019s not in an outdoor space.\n\nRemember also to be respectful of the furniture and not have your cat sit on it and leave hair behind.\n\n4. Bass Pro Shops\n\nBass Pro Shops is a privately held retail chain that sells all sorts of fishing, hunting, and camping equipment. All Bass Pro Shops are pet-friendly unless they\u2019re located in a state or town with laws and regulations that restrict pets in public spaces.\n\nBass Pro also owns Cabela\u2019s, which is also an outdoor gear and equipment store. Since Cabela\u2019s is under the same ownership, the same pet rules apply to all Cabela\u2019s locations.\n\n5. DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods\n\nDICK\u2019S Sporting Goods sells all sorts of athletic equipment and outdoor gear. Most locations welcome leashed pets and pets in carriers but make sure to check the store\u2019s individual pet policy before bringing your cat. A nice thing about DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods is that most of the stores have large venues.\n\nSo, it\u2019s easy for you to walk around with your cat, and you don\u2019t really have to worry about bumping into too many people while you shop.\n\n6. Half Price Books\n\nHalf Price Books is a chain that sells new and used books, movies, and music. It\u2019s also a great place to look for discounted textbooks. In general, Half Price Books is pet-friendly, unless the store is located in a town that has more restrictive pet regulations. So, if your local Barnes & Noble doesn\u2019t allow cats, you can always try seeing if the Half Price Books nearest you welcomes pets inside.\n\n7. Hobby Lobby\n\nHobby Lobby is generally pet-friendly, but it\u2019s important to check with the specific store location before bringing your cat. Each store can have individual pet policies, so some may only allow dogs, while others will welcome other kinds of pets.\n\nIt\u2019s best to keep your cat in a carrier at all times in Hobby Lobby since it has many small items your cat may want to play with. It can easily get into some trouble if it gets caught up in yarn or starts batting small craft supplies, like pom poms and beads.\n\n8. Home Depot\n\nHome Depot officially only allows service dogs inside its stores. However, many Home Depots, especially ones located in pet-friendly communities, don\u2019t mind having leashed dogs and cats in carriers inside. Home Depot stores may also be more lenient about having leashed cats walk around their outdoor garden and patio areas.\n\nJust keep in mind that since Home Depot has a formal pet policy, the store managers have the right to refuse entry if you try to go inside with your cat.\n\n9. JOANN Fabric and Crafts\n\nJOANN Fabric and Crafts is a great location for creative individuals looking to start their next craft project. Fortunately, this chain has a pet-friendly policy. It does request pet owners to ensure that their pets are leashed or in a carrier bag and that they\u2019re on their best behavior.\n\nAll its requests are reasonable and in place to help pets and all customers enjoy a safe and undisruptive time while shopping.\n\n10. L.L. Bean\n\nL.L. Bean gladly welcomes pets at all its locations and just requests that they remain leashed or in a carrier at all times. So, your cat can accompany you as you shop for outdoor recreational equipment and apparel. The only exception to this rule is L.L. Bean\u2019s flagship store in Freeport, Maine.\n\nThis location has an indoor caf\u00e9, and L.L. Bean wants to keep pets away from caf\u00e9 food and drinks.\n\n11. Lowe\u2019s\n\nMost Lowe\u2019s locations welcome cats that are leashed or in a carrier and are well-behaved. So, if your local Home Depot is strict about restricting pets, you can try contacting your local Lowe\u2019s to see if they allow cats inside.\n\nHowever, Lowe\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a formal pet policy that welcomes pets, so some may only allow service dogs to enter.\n\n12. Marshall\u2019s/TJ Maxx/HomeGoods\n\nMarshall\u2019s is a pet-friendly department store. Just make sure to keep your cat in a carrier and in a calm state as you walk through the aisles. Marshall\u2019s is owned by TJX Companies, which also owns HomeGoods and TJ Maxx. All these stores have the same pet policy, so you\u2019re able to bring your cat to any of these locations as long as it\u2019s leashed or in a carrier. T\n\nhe only exception is if the store is located in a town with more rigid pet regulations.\n\n13. Michaels\n\nMichaels is a craft supply store that leaves its pet policy up to each individual store. Some stores will welcome pets while others have every right to refuse them. So, make sure to call your local Michael\u2019s before bringing your cat.\n\nMichaels is often a good location for cats that are new to shopping indoors. These stores are often much quieter and have less foot traffic than other stores, so it\u2019s a good location to get your cat acclimated to being outside of the home.\n\n14. Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom has been pet-friendly for decades and welcomes leashed dogs and cats of all sizes in its locations. Cats are also welcomed in Nordstrom Rack, which is Nordstrom\u2019s off-price department store. Just make sure that your cat is on their best behavior as Nordstrom carries many luxury brands, and you\u2019ll be responsible for any damages caused by your cat.\n\nIt\u2019s often best to keep your cat in a carrier just to be safe.\n\n15. Orvis\n\nOrvis is a family-owned retail chain that sells outdoor sporting goods and fly-fishing goods. Orvis has an official dog-friendly statement that welcomes leashed dogs in all its stores throughout the country. You can check with your local Orvis to see if it also welcomes cats.\n\nJust keep in mind that Orvis stores tend to attract a lot of dogs, so your cat may not enjoy accompanying you if you bump into a lot of dogs while you shop.\n\n16. Patagonia\n\nPatagonia lets its individual store locations determine if they\u2019ll be pet-friendly or not. Keep in mind that some stores are dog-friendly, but they may not be cat-friendly. So, make sure to call your local Patagonia to ask about its pet policy and specifically ask if cats are allowed inside.\n\n17. Pottery Barn\n\nPottery Barn is known for allowing pets in most of its locations. However, it doesn\u2019t have a formal pet policy, so some locations may not allow pets indoors. Since Pottery Barn often sells fragile items that can easily break, it\u2019s best to keep your cat in its carrier at all times while you shop.\n\nIt\u2019s also better to keep your cat at home if it tends to get easily excitable or frightened.\n\n18. Sierra\n\nSierra is a retail store that offers off-price active and outdoor apparel and equipment. Sierra is a brand that\u2019s operated by TJX Companies, so it has the same pet policies as TJ Maxx, Marshall\u2019s, and HomeGoods.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that dogs are more commonly seen at Sierra. So, if your cat doesn\u2019t like dogs, it\u2019s probably best to leave them at home rather than risk exposing them to a stressful situation.\n\n19. Tractor Supply Co.\n\nTractor Supply Co. sells farm supplies, pet and animal feed, clothing, and other outdoor goods. Tractor Supply Co. has a pet-friendly policy, and all of its stores welcome pets unless they\u2019re located in a more pet-restrictive neighborhood. Make sure to keep your cat leashed or in a carrier at all times, and keep an eye out for dogs, as this location is a popular spot for dogs accompanying their owners while they shop.\n\n20. True Value Hardware\n\nTrue Value Hardware is a home improvement brand, and each of its stores is independently owned and operated. Since the stores are independently owned, they\u2019ll have their own pet policies. Most True Value Hardware stores are pet-friendly and welcome cats in carriers. However, there are a few that don\u2019t allow pets.\n\nSo, make sure to call beforehand for accurate and updated information on your local True Value Hardware\u2019s pet policy.\n\nConclusion\n\nShopping with your pet can be a fun experience, and many retail stores allow cats and dogs on their premises. Just keep in mind that even if a company has a pet-friendly policy, local laws and regulations can prevent cats from entering stores. So, make sure to call a store beforehand to ensure that your pet is allowed inside.\n\nIf the store allows pets, do your best to follow their pet rules to keep them from having any reasons to discourage pets from shopping with their owners.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Eric Isselee, Shutterstock",

            "content": "At 100 years old, JoCleta Wilson still works and drives herself to her job \u2014 just the latest career path for the former dancer and business owner. She\u2019s Home Depot\u2019s oldest employee in the U.S., the company says, working as a cashier in a store in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nWilson, who works two mornings a week, from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., sought out the job to be around other people and talk with customers.\n\n\u201cI retired three different times \u2014 10 years each time in retirement, and it is not what it\u2019s cracked up to be. I got so tired of myself,\u201d Wilson tells TODAY.com.\n\n\u201cI had to get out of the house and come back to work and see what was going on in society. \u2026 I have a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nMost customers probably have no idea the vivacious, energetic woman at the register is 100 years old. She celebrated the milestone birthday last October with a big party at her home, complete with two piano players and 80 guests.\n\nHome Depot also threw her a \u201chuge party,\u201d she says.\n\nWilson lives independently in her house, drives her car to commute to work and go shopping, and cooks for herself. She hires people to clean her house and do her yard work \u2014 \u201cI could do it, but I don\u2019t want to. By getting this old, I got a little smart, too,\u201d she explains, laughing.\n\nWilson still dances and says she feels decades younger than her age.\n\n\u201cI feel like 39 having to go into 40 years old. It\u2019s that kind of step,\u201d Wilson notes about turning 100.\n\nJoCleta Wilson celebrates turning 100 with a party at Home Depot in October 2024. She's the company's oldest employee in the U.S. Courtesy Home Depot\n\nShe\u2019s a breast cancer survivor, has emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and has a pacemaker, \u201cbut everything else works,\u201d she says, noting she feels and moves fine.\n\nHere are her simple tips for a long, healthy life:\n\nKeep moving your body\n\nWilson is a former professional dancer, so she\u2019s had movement built into her daily routine much of her life. She began studying dance as a child and worked through high school, ultimately joining the June Taylor dancers and performing rhythm tap.\n\nShe later owned the Louisville Dance Academy for 37 years, teaching others to dance. Good posture is a priority, so she stands with her back against the wall once a week to see how she\u2019s doing and fix any slouching.\n\nWilson calls movement \u201cvery important\u201d to longevity and she\u2019s still dancing at 100.\n\n\u201cI have the radio everywhere. Thank goodness for Alexa. I tell her to play something that\u2019s really good to jump to, and I have at it,\u201d she says. \u201cI let go and move and do what I want to do and it feels good. That\u2019s my exercise.\u201d\n\nWilson likes to stay creative: She has performed on stage in recent years, written a cookbook and paints. Courtesy Home Depot\n\nBe willing to change your diet to stay healthy\n\nTwo different health issues prompted Wilson to change her diet.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed with cancer, an oncologist nurse told her \u201ccancer feeds on sugar\u201d and recommended avoiding it. \u201cI said, I can handle that,\u201d Wilson recalls.\n\n(There\u2019s no evidence sugar will make cancer worse or that a tumor will shrink or disappear if a patient stops eating it, according to current guidance from the National Cancer Institute. But eating lots of sugar can lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for cancer.)\n\nWilson stopped eating bacon and cheese years ago when she was diagnosed with very high cholesterol. After working with a nutritionist, she focuses on eating lean protein like chicken, fish and steak, and avoiding white flour.\n\n\u201cI eat well. I don\u2019t eat out a lot. I do my own cooking and enjoy it,\u201d she says.\n\nHave pleasures to look forward to\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t shun sweets altogether.\n\n\u201cI always have a chocolate cake in my freezer,\u201d she says. \u201cI take a slice but maybe once a week.\u201d\n\nShe also keeps ice cream in the freezer and has a tablespoon once in a while. When she gets a gift of candy, it lasts her for months because she cuts the pieces in half and eats half a piece a week.\n\nThe key is to indulge occasionally, but not overdo it, which takes a lot of discipline, Wilson advises.\n\nWilson celebrates her 100th birthday. Courtesy Home Depot\n\nStay creative\n\nBesides dancing, Wilson likes to sing, and has performed on stage in recent years. She\u2019s written a cookbook, paints and has an Instagram page devoted to her artwork.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\n\nThe centenarian credits \u201cstubbornness and determination\u201d as well as common sense for getting through tough times and living a long life.\n\nShe also tries to release negative feelings and stay optimistic \u2014 a trait linked with longevity.\n\n\u201cI always say, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t let everything make you angry. Anger takes a lot of muscle and a lot of good out of your life,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to think positive than to think negative. It takes a lot less effort. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d",

Taking simple steps now can protect vulnerable areas of your home from the chill that\u2019s expected to settle in.\n\nKey Winterizing Tips:\n\nDisconnect Hoses- Outdoor hoses should be removed from faucets before the cold sets in. Attach faucet protectors to help prevent damage to pipes.\n\nInsulate Pipes- Pipes in areas like attics, garages, or crawl spaces should be wrapped in heat tape or pipe insulation to prevent freezing. These areas are particularly vulnerable during cold weather.\n\nCover Outdoor Faucets- Faucet covers provide a quick and simple way to shield pipes from the cold. Insulate or cover outdoor faucets to keep them safe.\n\nCheck Your Water Meter- Take time to locate your water meter and ensure it is properly insulated. This small step can prevent potential damage in the event of a burst pipe.\n\nExposed pipes in unheated areas like attic, garages and crawl spaces are especially vulnerable to freezing. Without insulation or protection, those pipes can burst, leading to costly repairs and water damage.\n\nIn an emergency situation, knowing where your water meter is and how to shut off the water can create less of a headache.\n\nCopyright 2025 KCBD.

Support City Bureau\u2019s Civic Reporting fellowship by becoming a recurring donor.\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 On a cold, snowy morning in mid-March, Marielis Yepez, 30, and Adriana Valencia, 32, search for one particular contractor in a sea of customers loading their cars at a Southwest Side Home Depot. The pair are the only women among a group of more than two dozen men hoping to find a day\u2019s work near the parking lot\u2019s western entrance.\n\nListen \ud83c\udfa7 The Never Ending Line\n\nThe contractor had promised the women $200 each, approximately $5 per hour, for a week\u2019s worth of construction work, they said.

They are only able to look for work within a 20-foot-radius area within the parking lot, they said.\n\nAny day laborer seen outside that area is intimidated by security, the workers say, making it impossible for Yepez and Valencia to search more broadly for the contractor who owes them their wages.\n\nCity Bureau spoke with more than a dozen migrant day laborers who said wage theft, sub-minimum wage rates and clashes with Home Depot security personnel \u2014 including off-duty Chicago Police Department officers \u2014 have made it precarious for them to look for work.\n\nFor decades, Chicago immigrants have turned to informal gigs, often solicited on street corners or in Home Depot parking lots, in hopes of earning money to survive.\n\n\u201cDay laborers are crucial to the functioning of the building and the beauty of our city,\u201d said Miguel Alvelo Rivera, executive director of Latino Union of Chicago, a community-based worker center that organizes day laborers and household workers.\n\n\u201cA lot of what makes Chicago the city it is has been done by day laborers, who have to seek work at corner hiring sites where they expose themselves to 100-degree-plus weather, negative-20-degree weather, rain storms [and] snow, because we currently do not have a system to ensure that work can be guaranteed as a right,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike publicly funded hiring halls in California and Texas, where day laborers can safely connect with contractors and negotiate pay rates, Chicago\u2019s day labor industry is rife with wage theft, unsafe working conditions, physical violence and exploitation, City Bureau found.\n\nPeople entering the day labor sector don\u2019t always know about minimum wage laws. Some get paid far less than they were promised at the start of the day, while others might finish a full day of work and end up with no pay at all, organizers and workers said.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways to really prevent and reduce these abuses in these situations is if you regulate and formalize day labor work,\u201d Alvelo Rivera said. \u201cAnd if you connect people and create spaces for them to safely seek jobs.\u201d\n\nRecent national data on day labor work is hard to come by; a rare national study on the topic took place in 2006 and surveyed 2,660 day laborers. The study found that nearly half of all day laborers had experienced wage theft in the two months prior to being surveyed. Nearly half, 48%, had experienced underpayment by employers during the same time period, according to the study.\n\nA 2021 survey of 411 day laborers in Denver found that 62% of those workers had experienced wage theft.\n\nAdriana Valencia, left, and Marielis Yepez, are some of the only women looking for work as day laborers outside a Home Depot in New City. Credit: Talia Sprague/For City Bureau\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t feel safe when we go out to work\u2019\n\nYepez and Valencia began working as day laborers as soon as they arrived in Chicago last year.\n\nYepez left her 10-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 13 and 4, behind in Venezuela. Valencia came to the United States with her daughters, ages 1 and 11.\n\nYepez and Valencia don\u2019t qualify for Temporary Protected Status, a federal immigration program that allows people to stay in the United States and get work permits when it\u2019s unsafe for them to return to their home countries. For Venezuelans to qualify, they must have arrived in the United States on or before July 31, 2023.\n\nNeither woman has a work permit, which takes an average of six months to receive when applying for Temporary Protected Status, according to guidance from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWith no legal work authorization, they seek out day labor jobs to get by.\n\n\u201cWork here is tough,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel safe when we go out to work. You have to be alert all the time.\u201d\n\nYepez and Valencia have seen contractors who arrive early and only take women with them, they said. They are afraid of being trafficked.\n\nThey also worry about being injured doing construction work, with which they have little experience.\n\nBoth women have done plumbing, electrical work, drywall installation and roofing \u2014 all requiring new skills they\u2019ve learned on the job, they said. This type of work usually pays them around $80 per day. Much of the work is supposed to be restricted to workers who are licensed in their respective fields after documented training and certification, according to Illinois law.\n\n\u201cWhen we do roofing, they do not give us any safety measures,\u201d Yepez said. \u201cWe are not protected. We need to go up to the roofs, and we do not have harnesses.\u201d\n\nWhile they are aware of the dangers, their need to make a living outweighs the risks, they said. Recently, both did demolition work on a house where they had to unload 50 bags of concrete.\n\n\u201cWe feel helpless. But what can you do?\u201d Valencia said. \u201cWe need to keep coming because I have two daughters, and I need to provide for them.\u201d\n\nOn top of the strain and uncertainty, Yepez is apart from her children for the first time. They are living with her mother in Venezuela, and she sends money home every week, she said.\n\n\u201cBeing without them has been too hard, too hard,\u201d Yepez said. She stays in touch over video calls, but \u201cmy heart breaks listening to them tell me that they miss me,\u201d she said.\n\nAdriana Valencia, center, attempts to flag down a passing driver for work. Credit: Talia Sprague/For City Bureau\n\nRough Conditions\n\nEduardo Cisneros, a senior attorney at Legal Aid Chicago, said contractors take advantage of workers slowly, using tactics such as force and coercion.\n\n\u201cFor the first week \u2026 everything\u2019s fine. They\u2019re being paid,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cThey keep going back. They\u2019re being asked to work more. And then they get the end of the week \u2014 maybe they worked overtime, or just 40 hours \u2014 but then they don\u2019t get paid.\u201d\n\nThe contractor keeps promising them they will get paid, so the workers keep going back.\n\nJeison Rend\u00f3n, 24, has firsthand experience losing out on promised pay.\n\nHe came to Chicago in November 2023, and quickly began picking up day work from the Home Depot parking lot, he said.\n\nWage theft happens frequently, Rend\u00f3n said. There have been days when he works at least eight hours and ends up getting paid the equivalent of $5 an hour \u2014 well below the state\u2019s $14 minimum hourly wage. (Beginning Jan. 1, the state minimum wage will go up to $15 per hour.)\n\n\u201cThere are bad people that hire you, but they don\u2019t tell you how much you will get paid,\u201d Rend\u00f3n said. \u201cYou trust they will pay you $120 to $140, but they only give you $40 or $50.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Vargas, former organizing director at Latino Union of Chicago, said \u201cit is very, very uncommon for folks to fight\u201d wage theft. Vargas\u2019 work for the union included educating migrants about labor rights.\n\n\u201cThere is fear of physical and bodily harm that occurs,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThere is also a feeling of \u2018I don\u2019t know how,\u2019 and, \u2018I don\u2019t know where to begin.\u2019 It is too overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAlong with labor exploitation, elements of fraud, force or coercion escalate the situation into cases of human trafficking, Cisneros said. Threats of physical or legal harm also play a role.\n\n\u201cUsually the threat of deportation is what keeps them in that situation to keep working,\u201d Cisneros said.\n\nMarielis Yepez, center-left, and Adriana Valencia, center-right, walk away from the entrance to a Home Depot in Chicago\u2019s New City neighborhood after securing a temporary job for the day on Tuesday, April 23, 2024. Credit: Talia Sprague/For City Bureau\n\nOptions For Workers\n\nThere are three avenues for day laborers to file complaints against employers: Through the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, the Illinois Department of Labor, or the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nDepartment officials have tried to make it easier for day laborers and migrant workers to file complaints about wage theft and other abuses, said Jason Keller, assistant director at the state labor department. That includes not requiring people to disclose their immigration status; providing worker rights resources in several languages; conducting worker outreach; and reaching out to advocacy organizations to assist in complaint filing, Keller said.\n\nOfficials also have partnered with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights to create education and outreach programs specifically for migrants. Topics in these workshops included child labor and worker protection laws.\n\nDespite that, the number of complaints filed by day laborers is not rising, Keller said. Between 3-4% of the complaints received by the department were regarding the Day and Temporary Labor Services Act, Keller said.\n\n\u201cDay laborers can be afraid to file a complaint and, as is the case with many of our laws, workers don\u2019t want confrontation,\u201d Keller said. \u201cMany of the workers are in vulnerable positions due to immigration status or desperately needing their jobs.\u201d\n\nJane Flanagan, director of the Illinois Department of Labor, recommends day laborers record basic information about their gigs to ward off potential abuses such as wage theft and make reporting any violations easier. For example, workers could log information like the name of the contractor who hired the worker, the location of the job and the license plate of the contractor\u2019s vehicle, she said.\n\nIf a worker does have a wage claim from that work, the Department of Labor can use that information to track down contractors who break the law, Flanagan said.\n\nOrganizations such as Latino Union of Chicago and Raise the Floor Alliance routinely connect with migrant workers to give them resources about their rights.\n\nLatino Union of Chicago organizers have been going out to Home Depots throughout the city to share information about labor rights to asylum-seekers working as day laborers. With options such as a group chat for migrants to share job leads and contractors to avoid, the organization seeks to build pathways for communication between workers.\n\nRend\u00f3n is part of the Latino Union group chat and said it helps him feel safer, and as if others have his back.\n\nRend\u00f3n has also made friends at Home Depot. Together, they inform newcomers about labor laws and keep each other alert about contractors who pay less than the minimum.\n\n\u201cAfter a couple of bad experiences, now we first ask how much we will get paid,\u201d Rendon said.\n\nAfter a year of day labor, Yepez said she remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cI thank God, because, despite everything, I\u2019ve learned a lot of things,\u201d Yepez said. \u201cI know someone will come and will give us work the way it should be.\u201d\n\nAs for Rend\u00f3n, he isn\u2019t planning to stay if the outlook doesn\u2019t improve, he said.\n\n\u201cI am here with my wife and two kids, but I will stay here only until year\u2019s end,\u201c he said. \u201cIf nothing happens, then I will go to Colombia.\u201d",

            "content": "Core to the Biden administration\u2019s economic policy was an attempt to rebalance the power between workers and employers through labor and employment regulations, from the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ban on non-compete clauses to the Department of Labor\u2019s expanded overtime protections.\n\nAt the center of this effort was the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency charged with protecting workers\u2019 rights to organize and combating unfair labor practices. Led by general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, the board took an active stance in interpreting and enforcing labor law, generating new precedents that reduced barriers to worker voice and unionization.\n\nWe reached out to Abruzzo to discuss takeaways from the NLRB\u2019s efforts, as well as advice for how policymakers and business leaders should move forward under a new administration. Here are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nSign up for Charter's newsletter to get the handbook for the future of work delivered to your inbox.\n\nWhat do you see as the most important achievements of the Biden NLRB? What has been the impact on workers and organizations?\n\nWe\u2019ve made great gains in enforcing labor law in the way Congress intended\u2014to protect the rights of workers to organize, engage together to improve their wages, benefits and working conditions, collectively bargain through representatives of their free choosing, or refrain from these activities.\n\nWe\u2019ve won transformative Board decisions, such as: Miller Plastics and American Federation for Children, which better defines protected concerted activities; Home Depot, which protects workers engaged in social, racial, and economic justice advocacy to improve their workplaces; Stericycle, which ensures employers\u2019 work rules do not restrict employee statutory rights; McLaren Macomb, which precludes broad confidentiality and non-disparagement language in severance agreements; Lion Elastomers, which better addresses employee conduct during union and protected concerted activities; Cemex, which better protects workers\u2019 rights to organize a union; Amazon Logistics, which prohibits employers from coercing employees in captive audience meetings, and many more.\n\nWe\u2019ve obtained robust and impactful remedies for workers and their families when statutory rights have been violated\u2013in settlements and in litigation. And we\u2019ve achieved significant progress in making the NLRB more accessible and ensuring that all workers know their rights and can safely participate in our processes\u2014no matter the language they speak, their immigration status, or their identity.\n\nWhat did you see during the last Trump NLRB that has informed your strategy during the Biden administration? Given the back-and-forth nature of presidential transitions, are there ways that the NLRB has sought to protect progress against future reversals?\n\nEvery NLRB board member and general counsel is charged by Congress with fully effectuating the National Labor Relations Act. That is what I\u2019ve tried to do and what I expect that every future board member and general counsel will do. My hope is that they will act in their respective positions keeping in mind why the NLRA was enacted in the first place, which was to address industrial instability caused by workers\u2019 lack of sufficient channels of communication with their employers by leveling the playing field between employers and employees and giving workers the right to organize, collectively bargain, and act together to improve their workplace circumstances.\n\nWith the constitutionality of the NLRB under attack from some employers and anti-labor activists, how do you make the case for the continued relevance of the NLRB in today\u2019s economy?\n\nIn today\u2019s economy, workers\u2019 rights to organize and join together are more important than ever and the NLRB is the protector of those rights at the federal level. As for the NLRB being under attack, it is nothing new for big companies to challenge the authority of the NLRB to enforce workers\u2019 rights so as not to be held accountable for their violations of the National Labor Relations Act. In 1937, the Supreme Court made it clear that the NLRA is constitutional, and the NLRB will continue to do what Congress has mandated it to do, despite the continued challenges. While the current challenges require the NLRB to expend scarce resources defending against them, we\u2019ve seen that the result of these kinds of challenges is ultimately a delay in justice, but that ultimately justice does prevail.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role of the c-suite in preserving and reaffirming workers\u2019 rights? Are there ways that leaders can actively cultivate more democratic workplaces even as some prepare for a less active enforcement in the next administration?\n\nManagement can make an enormous difference in the lives of their workers and communities by respecting their workers\u2019 rights, including ensuring managers and supervisors understand what they can and cannot do under labor law, and engaging in good faith collective bargaining where employees have chosen to be represented by a union. The Small Business Administration has a really helpful Digital Toolkit to Empower Workers and Promote Benefits of Equitable Labor-Management Partnerships and I\u2019ve put out resources for employers on collective bargaining as well: GC Collective Bargaining Resources | National Labor Relations Board.\n\nWhen workers have a voice at the table and when their concerns are considered and addressed, it makes businesses more productive in innumerable ways.\n\nFor more coverage on how to navigate the presidential transition, check out our transition policy tracker.",

            "content": "It's challenging to find dividend-paying stocks with attractive growth prospects. That's because a company should have enough free cash flow (FCF) to support business opportunities and pay dividends.\n\nWhen you find these companies, it's a good idea to periodically examine them to determine what you should do with the stocks. While you can do this throughout the year, January is a convenient time to do it.\n\nWalmart (WMT -0.82%) and Home Depot (HD -4.19%) have long histories of raising payouts and should continue providing capital appreciation opportunities. That makes them ideal candidates for current investors to buy more shares.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nWalmart has become a household name with its widespread namesake stores and Sam's Club stores. It currently serves 255 million customers every week. Its focus on keeping costs very low to keep prices down has clearly attracted shoppers.\n\nWhile this core philosophy hasn't changed, management has been investing in technology to create a better experience for customers, such as ordering online and picking up in the stores, including same-day delivery in many locations.\n\nPeople continue to see Walmart as a place to shop and spend money. The core Walmart U.S. segment had a same-store sales (comps) increase of 5.3% in the fiscal third quarter. More than half of the increase was attributable to e-commerce. This covered the period ended on Oct. 31, 2024.\n\nThe quarter's adjusted operating income for the entire company grew 6.2% when excluding foreign currency translation effects. Management expects at least an 8.5% increase in profitability for the entire year.\n\nWalmart initially declared a dividend in 1974, and has raised it annually. That makes the company a Dividend King. Its FCF of $6.2 billion during the first nine months of the year comfortably covered the $5 billion in dividends.\n\nThe company's strong business hasn't gone unnoticed by investors, of course. The stock gained over 71% over the past year through Jan. 2, handily beating the S&P 500's 23%. Walmart shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37, versus 30 for the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, given the company's performance and prospects, it seems reasonable that the stock has a higher valuation.\n\n2. Home Depot\n\nFounded in the late 1970s, Home Depot has grown to become the largest home improvement retailer by revenue. The company has more than $150 billion in annual sales.\n\nIts results fluctuate with the economy. That's because people buy homes and undertake major construction projects when they feel good about their personal financial situation.\n\nRecently, Home Depot's results have been weighed down by larger economic forces, such as elevated interest rates, that made it more expensive to buy a home and finance projects. Additionally, higher prices for basic items like food and housing made homeowners more reluctant to fund construction.\n\nComps have been dropping, including by 1.3% in its fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 27, 2024. Management expects comps to fall 2.5% for the year.\n\nHowever, there have been positive developments that should help boost Home Depot's sales. Existing home sales have reversed declines, increasing 4.8% in November. The Federal Reserve has been cutting short-term rates, affecting rates on home equity loans and lines of credit that are popular to finance construction.\n\nHome Depot has increased dividends every year since 2010. While earnings have been dropping lately, its 60% payout ratio indicates that the payment remains safe.\n\nThe shares gained 12.7% over the last year, but they have badly lagged the S&P 500. However, when economic conditions improve, Home Depot remains in a strong position to benefit, which should propel sales and earnings increases.\n\nHome Depot's shares trade at a P/E of 26, a discount to the S&P 500.",

            "content": "A Biden administration ban on certain natural gas water heaters as part of the lame duck president\u2019s climate agenda could send prices soaring for the elderly and the poor.\n\nUnder the policy, new non-condensing, natural gas-fired water heaters will be prohibited for sale starting in 2029 due to concerns about carbon-dioxide emissions. The policy comes during President Biden\u2019s twilight days in the White House and was quietly announced without a press release.\n\nIf the policy takes effect, as it is slated to on March 11, a little less than 40% of the tankless water heaters currently on the market would be banned, according to an estimate from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.\n\n4 President Joe Biden speaks at the Department of Labor on Dec. 16, 2024. Getty Images\n\nThe new rules, which were published by the Department of Energy just after Christmas, also stipulate that new tankless gas water heaters must rely on 13% less energy than the least efficient comparable model on the markets today.\n\nWhile the restrictions don\u2019t outright ban non-condensing models, only condensing models have been able to meet the new ratcheted-up energy efficiency requirements, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cWhen the rule goes into effect, all that manufacturing will basically be irrelevant,\u201d Frank Windsor, president of Rinnai America, a water heater manufacturer, told the outlet.\n\n4 A natural gas water heater sits on display at a San Rafael, Ca. Home Depot on March 15, 2023. Getty Images\n\n\u201cA lot of the major equipment that we\u2019ve invested in will basically have to be scrapped.\u201d\n\nRinnai had just finished up a roughly $70 million factory in Georgia to produce non-condensing gas water heaters in the US.\n\nCustomers will be pushed towards buying models that are more expensive or lean on non-instantaneous storage tank water heaters, which are generally cheaper but tend to be less efficient than the ones that are facing a ban, per the report.\n\nFor example, a Rinnai America tankless non-condensing natural gas water heater goes for roughly $1,000 at Home Depot, while a comparable condensing tank goes for about $1,800.\n\nTankless technology is frequently used in smaller apartments or housing spaces, which means that a lot of lower-income and elderly people tend to use those types of water heaters.\n\n\u201cForcing low-income and senior customers to pay far more upfront is particularly concerning. DOE\u2019s decision to go ahead with a flawed final rule is deeply disappointing,\u201d Matthew Agen, the American Gas Association\u2019s chief counsel for energy, told the outlet.\n\nBy the Department of Energy\u2019s estimate, the costs saved over the long run by the new rules will be about $112 over a roughly 20-year stretch, Agen emphasized.\n\n\u201cThe final rule is a violation of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which prohibits DOE from promulgating a standard that renders a product with a distinct performance characteristic unavailable,\u201d he previously said.\n\n4 Workers remove a damaged hot water heater from a Houston home on Feb. 27, 2021. Houston Chronicle via Getty Imag\n\n4 Biden sits in the Oval Office of the White House during a meeting on Oct. 22, 2024. Getty Images\n\nNot everyone is up in arms about the new rules. The Appliance Standards Awareness Project cheered the development, claiming it will help reduce 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions related to water heaters over the course of about three decades.\n\nThat group had advocated for the new rules.\n\n\u201cThis is a commonsense step that will lower total household costs while reducing planet-warming emissions,\u201d Andrew deLaski, the firm\u2019s executive said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese long-awaited standards will ensure more families save with proven energy-efficient technology already used in a majority of tankless units.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on Jan. 20 and has expressed interest in reversing some of Biden\u2019s climate change policies.\n\nTrump has tapped Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright to serve as his secretary of energy.",

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology. 20 Years\n\nHelping You Live Richer Reviewed\n\nby Experts Trusted by\n\nMillions of Readers\n\nWhile many people have the urge to ride that new year energy into a home refresh or update, you\u2019ve also probably spent a significant amount of money on the holidays, which may leave your DIY home budget in the red.\n\nThe good news is that a lot of things that can significantly refresh the look and feel of your home don\u2019t actually cost that much money if you are strategic in your updates.\n\nHere are six of the best ways to spend $20 at Home Depot in the New Year that will have a refreshing feeling on your home and mood.\n\nInterior Paint\n\nPerhaps the most significant way to transform $20 into a whole new look in your home is through paint. Paint can literally change the look, feel and even lighting of a room with the swipe of a brush. While $20 won\u2019t get you enough paint for a whole house, pick the room that you spend the most time in or that people gravitate toward, such as a living room or kitchen. For example, one quart of Home Decorators satin enamel interior paint is just $17.98.\n\nLighting\n\nAnother wonderful way to change the look and feel of a room is to change out lighting. If you\u2019ve been relying on old incandescent bulbs, too, you\u2019re spending way too much money on lighting and now is a great time to shift to LED bulbs, which last much longer and produce far fewer watts of energy. You can get a pack of eight 60-Watt equivalent A19 dimmable LED light bulbs for just under $20 at Home Depot.\n\nCabinet Fixtures\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the littlest things that can keep a room from looking modern and updated. Kitchens, for example, can be transformed by some paint and new cabinet fixtures. For example, replace cabinet handles with these Liberty classic satin nickel cabinet drawer pulls at just over $5 each or these Harmon classic bronze cabinet knobs with copper highlights for $3.27 each.\n\nHouse Plants\n\nIf you\u2019d like to bring a natural touch that no paint or hardware can add, look to Home Depot\u2019s vast supply of indoor and outdoor house plants. Whether you prefer some dainty hanging plants, such as a variety of philodendrums or something more robust like this Maranta red prayer plant, you\u2019ll find a huge variety for $20 and under.\n\nFresh Grout\n\nOne of the simplest and most affordable ways to refresh tiles of any kind \u2014 be they in the bathroom or a kitchen backsplash \u2014 is not to replace them altogether, but to replace or refresh the grout that runs in between them. Grout can get dark, dirty and old over time. Pick up a quart of SimpleGrout\u2019s bright white pre-mixed grout (or select from other colors) for under $20.\n\nWall Art\n\nYou can brighten up a room with even less effort than any of the previous items on this list by adding some simple wall art. While prices vary, you can find some pieces at Home Depot like this reproduction of Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night painting in the form of an LED lighted canvas for $21 or this canvas wall image of a cow for under $20.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Pricing and availability may vary depending on location.",

ProblemSolved, Reviewed\n\nStarting this weekend, millions of Americans across more than a dozens states are expected to feel the coldest and most persistent blast of Arctic air reaching the Central, Southern and Eastern parts of the country.\n\nA winter storm emerging from the Rockies is forecast to bring rain, snow and ice to a large part of the U.S., the National Weather Service said Friday, bringing below freezing temperatures with it, creating hazardous travel conditions and possible power outages. Meteorologists said the cold high pressure will move east to the South and Central Appalachians by Sunday.\n\nIf you're planning to stay inside for the incoming cold blast, experts say failure to prepare at home when the temperature dips below freezing can cause major damage to houses and apartments and cost thousands of dollars in repairs.\n\nHere's how to to prepare for your home during cold weather and how to keep your pipes from bursting.\n\nCheck the weather forecast daily\n\nFreeze and cold weather warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nTo find out when temperatures are likely to dip below freezing, visit the weather service's website at weather.gov.\n\nUSA TODAY also tracks weather watches and warnings nationwide, which you can check anytime here.\n\nThermostats matter\n\nBeing prepared is key to preventing frozen pipes, Prime Drain Cleaning and Plumbing Owner Brycen Sperlich told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Open cupboards and vanities to warm pipes,\" said Sperlich, whose company is based in Middle Tennessee. \"That is something I've done before when temps are getting into the teens. Open up a cabinet (and that) allows more heat to get to the pipes.\"\n\nHe also recommends setting home thermostats no lower than 60 degrees.\n\nAvoid thermostat wars: What should you set your heat to in the winter?\n\nDrip your faucets\n\nWater expands when it freezes, Sperlich said, so people should drip indoor facets when temps dip below 32 degrees.\n\nJust make sure you drip the farthest faucet from your main valve.\n\n\"You don't have to drip them all,\" he said. \"One or two is fine.\"\n\nCover outside water spigots\n\nBefore the temperature drops below 32 degrees, outdoor water spigots attached to homes should be opened to allow to drain water out, closed and then covered.\n\nFaucet covers are fairly inexpensive and can be found at retailers including Amazon, Walmart and various home improvement stores like Home Depot or Lowe's.\n\nThey are simple and quick to attach. In a financial pinch? Cover one with a thick, waterproof insulated item like a glove or wool sock.\n\nIs snow in your forecast? Shop the best deals on snow blowers, space heaters, shovels\n\nWhich pipes freeze the most?\n\nAccording to The Red Cross, these pipes freeze most often at home:\n\nPipes exposed to \"severe cold\" including outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, and water sprinkler lines. (If you have swimming pool or sprinkler supply lines, they needed drained too.)\n\nWater supply pipes in unheated interior areas including basements, crawl spaces, attics, garages and cabinets.\n\nThose running against exterior walls that \"have little or no insulation.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to fix a typo.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) required DHS to draft a list of \u201cbest practices\u201d for car and truck rental companies to report suspicious behavior by renters to law enforcement to help prevent vehicles from being used as weapons of mass destruction.\n\n3 Darren Drake died in an ISIS-related terror attack in 2017, inspiring Drake\u2019s law.

The product has a strong overall user score from Home Depot customers, with one of its most commonly praised features being its compatibility with several attachments sold by other brands. This is especially useful since, despite being a high-quality device like Milwaukee's top-rated M12 tools, it isn't sold with a lot of different attachments.\n\nMilwaukee also doesn't sell separate accessories, either, so if you really want to expand the versatility of the tool, you'll need to rely on other brands. Most attachments aren't sold individually but instead as components of larger accessory kits. The upside of this is that you often won't need just one specific attachment, and by having many other accessories on hand, you may be inspired to use the rotary tool in ways you hadn't previously considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are six useful accessories for Milwaukee's M12 Rotary Tool that are available for purchase, as well as various accessory kits that include them.

Born on August 4, 1940, in Lake Charles, Chuck lived a full life of adventure, kindness, and deep connections.\n\nChuck grew up surrounded by siblings and cousins, often reminiscing about running barefoot along the country roads of Pleasant Hill. He proudly served his country in the U.S. Army from 1958 to 1961, spending two Christmases stationed at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. While in Korea, he reunited with his brother Bernard, also serving there. Chuck earned his GED during his Army service and was proud to have received his first \"high and tight\" haircut in the same chair as Elvis Presley. He also participated in snow removal for John F. Kennedy's Presidential Inauguration and received recognition directly from the President.\n\nIt was during his Army service that Chuck met the love of his life, Elaine Louise Stahl, through letters. After meeting on a blind date, they fell in love and married on October 14, 1961. In 1962, while serving in Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Chuck welcomed his first child, Charles Jr., and met him shortly before being sent to Tin City, Alaska. In 1966, Chuck and Elaine celebrated the birth of their daughter, Melissa.\n\nChuck served in the U.S. Air Force until 1967, retiring as an Airman First Class. After his military career, he worked for 30 years as Day Foreman at Olin Chemicals in Lake Charles.\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Chuck loved fishing and won numerous tournaments at Toledo Bend, including the Louisiana/Texas HydroSport Connection in 1984. He fished during Toledo Bend's inception in 1967 and continued fishing until his health no longer allowed him to stand in a boat. One of his greatest loves was taking his first granddaughter fishing every chance of he could.\n\nChuck also had a passion for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, riding to Sturgis three times and celebrating his 70th birthday with his last ride to the Black Hills.

In 2019, White started a side hustle: Handy Famm, the brand behind a multifunctional STEM learning tool for kids that allows them to help with DIY projects around the house. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nImage Credit: Rose Tzur. Joshua White.\n\nWhat was your day job or primary occupation when you started your side hustle?\n\nI am the principal and creative director of OffWhite Co., a multidisciplinary design firm. My journey began in traditional design, where I honed my skills in branding and design. This foundation eventually led me into the world of 3D animation and storytelling, collaborating with industry legends like Christopher Reeve and other Hollywood A-listers to create compelling narratives.\n\nRelated: Dry January, Anyone? He Started a Side Hustle After a 'Scary' Night of Drinking \u2014 and It's Exceeded $50 Million Revenue With 0 Outside Investment.\n\nWhen the films I worked on needed products or promotional items, I expanded my expertise into manufacturing pipelines \u2014 developing everything from Cathay Pacific Flight Attendant Barbie dolls to rebranding the iconic coffee maker AeroPress. My approach has always been rooted in delivering 360-degree solutions that are brand-centric, inventive and seamlessly integrate marketing and go-to-market strategies.\n\nWhen did you start your side hustle, and where did you find the inspiration for it?\n\nI started Handy Famm in 2019 after a trip to Home Depot with my young daughter. We were looking for tools she could use, but quickly realized there was nothing on the shelves designed specifically for kids\u2014 nothing real, functional, safe and definitely nothing that wasn't just a toy. That moment sparked the idea for a better solution.\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy of Handy Famm\n\nWhat were some of the first steps you took to get your side hustle off the ground?\n\nHaving run a creative agency for over 25 years, I've been fortunate to work with iconic brands like Chobani, Maple Hill, Jordan and AeroPress, helping them transform ambitious ideas into industry-leading brands.\n\nThat experience taught me a crucial lesson: The best ideas solve real, relatable problems. As a dad of six, I know firsthand the challenges parents face \u2014 keeping kids off screens while fostering family connection. I set out to create something that wasn't just hands-on and engaging but also educational, fun and safe \u2014 a DIY solution that brings families together.\n\nI also knew the product needed to be versatile enough to evolve into a broader range of DIY tools and, as a branding expert, I wanted a strong, iconic element to tie everything together. That's how Handy Famm's first product was born: a playful bird character with a personality-packed design. It features a tape measure tongue, the Eye-conic\u2122 level built into its eye (both functional and visually fun) and a built-in angle finder protractor.\n\nRelated: These 3 Americans Turned to Side Hustles After Being Laid Off. Now They're All Making Between $200,000 and $3 Million a Year: 'Sweet, Sweet Irony.'\n\nTo get there, I spent hours with my team deconstructing tape measures, sketching ideas with my kids, 3D printing prototypes and refining the design until it felt right. We gave the bird unique color options, fun names and distinct personalities, which added depth to the brand. This became the foundation for Handy Famm's approach \u2014 blending practical tools with creativity to make everyday DIY projects approachable and enjoyable for kids and families alike.\n\nAlthough we began with a soft launch on Kickstarter, successfully raising our $10,000 goal, the real work happened during the COVID-19 lockdown. I used that time to refine the product, collaborating closely with the factory to perfect our multifunctional tape measures. It wasn't until October 2022 that I went full throttle, launching Handy Famm on Amazon and taking our mission to empower the next generation of doers to a wider audience.\n\nImage Credit: David Khabinsky\n\nWhat were some of the biggest challenges you faced while building your side hustle, and how did you navigate them?\n\nInventing and building a product from scratch is always challenging, but I've spent my career turning ideas into reality, so that was actually the \"easy part.\" The real challenge was sales: breaking into Amazon, securing retailer placements, driving traffic from social to our website and navigating brick-and-mortar retail. Each step came with a learning curve \u2014 finding the right team members, building partnerships and understanding consumer buying behaviors. These are challenges I'm still navigating, but staying flexible, embracing failures as opportunities to learn and pivoting quickly have been key to our growth.\n\nAnother big hurdle was logistics. Finding a 3PL partner who understands our growth needs and can deliver without constant issues is critical for smooth scaling. Unfortunately, we went through several vendors early on, making mistakes and learning as we went. We're actually in the process of transitioning again, and I'm optimistic this next step will set us up for long-term success.\n\nHow long did it take you to see consistent monthly revenue? How much did the side hustle earn?\n\nWe were fortunate to see revenue as soon as we launched on Amazon \u2014 it's been a great platform for us. However, it took about a year to achieve consistent results. In our first year, we generated $185,000 in sales, primarily through Amazon and our website.\n\nRelated: This 24-Year-Old's Creative Side Hustle Surpassed $1 Million in Sales: 'Definitely Doing Something Right'\n\nWhat does growth and revenue look like now?\n\nAt the end of 2023, I recognized the need to raise pre-seed capital to achieve explosive growth and fully realize my vision for the brand. This included developing additional character-themed tools and embracing social channels more effectively.\n\nIn 2024, we went full throttle \u2014 inventing, patenting and designing two years' worth of products in under six months. The rest of the year was spent traveling to China to set up factories, building our team across sales, social and operations, and ensuring everything was ready for scale.\n\nEven with just our bird and dog tape measures, we closed in on $500,000 in sales for 2024 \u2014 a testament to the strength of our mission and product. With a solid foundation and a growing team, we're on track to shatter those numbers in 2025 and continue empowering families through creativity and hands-on learning.\n\nImage Credit: David Khabinsky\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about this side hustle?\n\nAs someone who loves building businesses, it's incredibly rewarding to see how my simple stroll through Home Depot with my daughter evolved into a thriving business with an engaged community of customers and brand advocates. What excites me most is seeing parents, kids and even retail buyers resonate with our mission of powering the next-gen of doers. Knowing that we're ahead of the curve in championing the resurgence of skilled trades \u2014 carpenters, plumbers and creators unafraid to use their hands \u2014 is deeply satisfying.\n\nOn a personal level, I love dreaming up new tools and products to expand the Handy Famm experience. Bringing our 3D-animated characters to life, building their personalities and using them to breathe energy into the brand is endlessly exciting. Cracking the code on social media, growing our YouTube presence and optimizing the retail channel are the kinds of challenges that keep me energized and inspired every day.\n\nRelated: How to Start a Side Hustle With Facebook, From 4 People Who Did It and Are Earning More Than $1 Million a Year\n\nBut the coolest part? Knowing my six kids and two grandkids not only use these tools but are also proud of what their dad and granddad created. Watching them measure, build and create \u2014 with something I dreamed up \u2014 is surreal. Hearing them say, \"My dad made this\" or \"My granddad made this\" is what it's all about. That's the kind of legacy that makes every late night and early morning totally worth it.\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy of Handy Famm\n\nWhat's your advice for others hoping to start successful side hustles of their own?\n\nStart with a real problem you care about solving \u2014 something that genuinely excites you. Don't get stuck chasing perfection; just start, test and tweak as you go. And remember, a side hustle isn't just about extra income: It's about building something meaningful that energizes you, challenges you and adds joy to your life. Surround yourself with positivity, people you want to share your journey with, and make it something you're proud of.",

            "content": "January 3, 2025\n\nThe Home Depot and Lay\u2019s both recently signed on as sponsors of FIFA World Cup 2026, one of the most lucrative athletic events globally, which for the first time is being hosted across three countries \u2014 Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.\n\nThe men\u2019s soccer tournament, held every four years, will also feature 48 teams, an expansion from 32 teams qualifying to play since the 1998 games.\n\nAs the Official Home Improvement Retailer of the event, Home Depot will run on-site activations at stadiums and FIFA fan festivals. Through its retail media network, select supplier partners in exclusive categories will be able to participate in World Cup-themed activations alongside Home Depot.\n\n\u201cWe know our customers love sports and we love connecting with them through their passions,\u201d said Molly Battin, SVP and chief marketing officer at Home Depot. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to help build the FIFA World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. \u2014 the communities where we live and work.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay announced that its Lay\u2019s brand will serve as an official sponsor of the 2026 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2027 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Brazil, extending Frito-Lay\u2019s role as a regional supporter during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and as a tournament supporter at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup 2023.\n\nLay\u2019s will also be prominently featured on each pitch during every match through LED field board exposure, press conference backdrops, and products sold across concession stands. Beyond stadiums, Lay\u2019s and other PepsiCo snack brands, including Doritos, Cheetos, Tostitos, and Ruffles, will hold FIFA fan zones across hosting cities.\n\nJane Wakely, chief consumer and marketing officer and chief growth officer of international foods at Lay\u2019s, said, \u201cSoccer is one of the world\u2019s biggest passion points, and this historic partnership allows us to bring the excitement and reach of the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup together with the joy and fun of our iconic brands across the world.\u201d\n\nFIFA\u2019s top-tier partners include Aramco, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Hyundai and Kia, Lenovo, Qatar Airways, and Visa, while other sponsors include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bank of America, McDonald\u2019s, Mengniu Diary, Unilever, and Verizon.\n\nFor the first time in the tournament\u2019s history, the FIFA World Cup will feature a \u201cSuper Bowl-like\u201d halftime show during the final championship match to be held at the MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.\n\nFootball has been America\u2019s favorite sport since 1972. According to a Gallup poll taken in December 2023, 41% of respondents said their favorite sport was football, followed by 10% for baseball, 9% for basketball, and 5% for soccer.\n\nHowever, soccer continues to expand in popularity, with many fans increasingly playing in their youth (or watching their kids play). A recent report on the state of soccer fandom in the U.S. by marketing, media, and experiences company For Soccer shows that the number of people who have been soccer fans for five years or fewer is up 57% compared to last year, and the number of first-time fans is up 400% year-over-year.\n\nThe last time the U.S. hosted the FIFA World Cup was in 1994 when the country had only a handful of professional soccer leagues. With the current momentum behind the sport, many are predicting the FIFA World Cup 2026 could be a breakthrough event for the sport of soccer, with the marketing opportunity potentially rivaling the Super Bowl in the U.S.\n\nRay Major, chief deputy CEO and chief economist at SANDAG, told the San Diego Union-Tribune, \u201cSoccer fans continue to grow in the U.S., and around the world, making the World Cup more appealing than ever. More importantly, the 2026 World Cup will be held in North America at 16 locations, many of which will be in the U.S. One should not underestimate the impact of potential advertisers who are going to go all out to market and sponsor what is essentially 16 Super Bowls in one year.\u201d\n\nJessica Giordano, senior partnership and brand experience leader at marketing and sponsorship activation agency GMR Marketing, said on the Footballco Business Podcast, \u201cOne of my most favorite parts about the World Cup itself is just the fandom and the pure melting of culture, which you see in the World Cup. And so when we talk about, again, the biggest event, I think it\u2019s bringing all of those elements. And [it\u2019s] in the United States, which is the most commercially significant event as well.\u201d",

            "content": "Thursday, January 2, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE), as well as a micro-cap stock AMREP Corp. (AXR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+24.0% vs. +23.8%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance. (You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>> ) Shares of Home Depot have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+18.5% vs. +17.9%). The company\u2019s stock prices is driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. The company delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand. Home Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience. HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. (You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>> ) Pfizer\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-4.3% vs. +0.9%). The company\u2019s revenues from Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 products are declining due to lower demand. Pfizer also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products face patent expirations. However, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenue growth improved in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position, which is being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Seagen\u2019s acquisition has strengthened its position in oncology. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reducing measures should drive profit growth. (You can read the full research report on Pfizer here >>> ) Shares of AMREP have outperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (+44.3% vs. -8.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $166.03 million has achieved impressive financial growth in fiscal 2025, with fiscal second-quarter revenues up 34.5% to $11.9 million and net income soaring 264.8% to $4 million. First-half revenues rose 61.9% to $30.9 million, driven by operational efficiency and favorable market conditions. Strategic land holdings in New Mexico position AMREP to benefit from rising housing demand amid easing monetary policies, declining mortgage rates and limited supply, supporting long-term growth. Favorable macro trends and resilient housing prices drive profitability. Risks include geographic concentration, market volatility, affordability challenges, reliance on the real estate market and elevated input costs. Regulatory changes, competition and economic uncertainty could impact performance, but AMREP\u2019s operational efficiency and strong margins mitigate these risks.

That's how hot the flame was coming through. I was only about two feet away from it,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nHe says he hid in the back of his trailer waiting for firefighters to rescue him.

            "content": "A historic depot in an Indiana town of 400 is home to a new interurban museum\n\nAMO, Indiana \u2014 The Amo Interurban History Museum's initial plan was to fill just one area of the old depot with donations to illustrate the town's history. But the collection soon spilled into two additional rooms as word about the project spread among residents past and present.\n\nThe museum opened in September in a historic depot that the organizing committee hopes will reach new generations of admirers thanks to its close proximity to the Vandalia Trail, a path for runners, bikers and walkers that stretches through Hendricks county.\n\n\"It's not so much for us, but these small towns \u2014 most of them fold and dry out,\" said David Phillips, who grew up in Amo and now lives west of Danville. \"As industry changes and business changes, you lose the small-town atmosphere. ... So we felt that if we did something like this, at least those younger kids growing up in Amo know a little bit about the town.\"\n\nNow in and around rooms that once housed waiting passengers and train operations are displays largely dedicated to the town's train and school history. A replica of the Amo High School Gymnasium, built by museum committee member Darrell Mynatt and resident Greg Burch, stands as a tribute to the school that saw its last class in 1964.\n\nA 1950s Amo high school band uniform stands beside one that belonged to a cheerleader \u2014 both worn by a couple who began dating in high school and later married. Displays show class portraits, articles honoring champion basketball teams, and historic photos and artifacts that once belonged to the interurban trains that ran past the depot. Even more items, stored in boxes for now, will provide enough options so organizers can rotate the displays and encourage visitors to return, committee facilitator Becky Rhea said.\n\nThe interurban alone provides plenty of fodder for storytelling.\n\nIn 1907, the first car arrived at the Amo depot on the Terre Haute, Indianapolis and Eastern interurban line, known as THI&E. For the next 33 years, people used the electric railcars to visit family in neighboring areas, travel between larger cities and the countryside, and commute to college.\n\nAutomobiles' rising popularity contributed to the interurban's end in Amo in 1940. After that, the depot became part of a grain elevator operation.\n\nThe town of Amo bought the building in 2001 and renovated it so that its Victorian Romanesque attributes, including arched openings and decorative brick patterns, would shine once again. In 2007, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and reopened as the town's Reading Room.\n\nBut installing a museum in the building was a longtime dream for residents. Phillips and Mynatt, both 1963 graduates of Amo High School, helped spearhead the effort, which has been endorsed as a Hendricks County Bicentennial project this year.\n\nAlthough both men had grown up in Amo, they hadn't heard much about the interurban that had brought such prosperity to the town, which the 2020 census listed as having a population of just more than 400 people. The committee hopes to flesh out that story as the museum continues to receive donations. Adding technology to help tell Amo's history and inviting schools for field trips are part of future plans.\n\n\"This museum will be very meaningful to today's generation growing up because they'll know what an interurban was,\" Phillips said.\n\nFollow the Yellow Trail: A 100-year-old marketing scheme ties this Indiana town together, where all roads lead to Hope\n\nOne more bonus is that the museum will provide a permanent home for organizers' own memorabilia.\n\n\"I've got a lot of pictures in there that I saved from high school,\" Mynatt said. \"And I said, man, I want to get these out of the house, so I'd like to start a museum. And that's what we did.\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Amo Interurban History Museum\n\nWhen: The official open house will be in the spring. For now, people can visit when the reading room is open: 5 p.m.-7 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10 a.m.-noon Wednesdays and 10 a.m.-noon on the first Saturdays of the month\n\nWhere: 4988 Railroad St., Amo, Indiana 46103\n\nCost: Free.

            "content": "Improved Sales Trend and Expectations on Low Rates : Furniture and home furnishing store sales grew 0.3% in November 2024 compared to the prior month and 0.7% from last year, according to the Census Bureau's Advance Retail Sales Report for November 2024. An anticipated increase in home sales, given the lower rate environment, is expected to boost demand for home furnishings.\n\nThe Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry comprises retailers offering home furnishing products under various categories. The merchandise assortment includes furniture, garden accessories, framed art, lighting, mirrors, candles, tableware, lamps, picture frames, bathware, accent rugs, artificial floral products, and child and teen furnishings. The industry players also develop, manufacture, market and distribute bedding products. The companies provide home and security products for residential home repair, remodeling, new construction and security applications. They are involved in manufacturing, assembling and selling faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposal.\n\nCompanies like The Home Depot Inc. , Williams-Sonoma, Inc. , Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. and Tempur Sealy International, Inc. have been leveraging product reinvention, efficient cost management, exclusive collaborations, and innovative marketing strategies stand out as winners, as they capture market share while enhancing the customer experience. While concerns about consumer confidence and stiff competition persist, the industry's adaptability and focus on customer-centric strategies position it for success.\n\nThe growing consumer preference for sustainable and multifunctional designs aligns with evolving urban lifestyles, further fueling sector growth. E-commerce continues to be a game-changer, especially for millennial shoppers, with investments in digital platforms and supply chain optimizations promising to drive revenue growth.\n\nThe Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by improving sales trends, product innovation, and strong e-commerce growth. With interest rates expected to remain low, a rebound in home sales is anticipated, which should directly bolster demand for furniture and home furnishings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThere is a growing demand for sustainable and multifunctional furniture, reflecting environmental consciousness and urban living needs. Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has made online furniture shopping increasingly popular, especially among millennials. The U.S. home furnishing market is expected to experience growth in 2025, with the expectation of a rebound in home sales and a rise in consumer spending.\n\nStrong Digital Platform, Product Reinvention & Marketing Moves: The optimization of the supply chain and an improvement in e-commerce channels are expected to drive the top line. E-commerce will continue to play a major role as people find it more comfortable and safer to shop online. Product innovation plays a pivotal role in market share gain in this industry. Companies aim to come up with products and collaborate with celebrated brands and designers to maintain exclusivity. Also, customer experience is being enhanced by innovative marketing techniques, with an emphasis on digital marketing, better merchandising, store remodeling and loyalty programs.\n\nLow Consumer Confidence: In December 2024, U.S. consumer confidence dropped sharply, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index declining to 104.7 from 112.8 in November. Consumers became more pessimistic about the outlook of the economy amid uncertainty around the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Their views on current business conditions fell, and they expressed more concerns about future labor market conditions, business outlook, and income.\n\nStiff Competition: The home furnishing industry is highly competitive, with interior design trade and specialty stores, antique dealers, national and regional home furnishing retailers as well as department stores giving a hard time. Online retailers focused on home furnishing also pose a threat. Competitive product pricing has been eating into margins.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #67, which places it in the top 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates optimistic near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. Since November 2024, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for 2025 has increased to $11.61 per share from $11.59.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags the Sector & S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Retail-Home Furnishings industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&P 500 Composite over the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 15.6% compared with the broader sector\u2019s 30.8% growth. The Zacks S&P 500 Composite has gained 26.2% over this period.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio, which is commonly used for valuing retail home furnishing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.67 compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 25.08 and the sector\u2019s 27.4.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.03X and as low as 14.07X, with the median being 19.95X.\n\n4 Retail-Home Furnishings Stocks to Watch\n\nWe have highlighted four stocks from the industry that are capitalizing on fundamental strengths and have solid growth prospects.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma: This is a San Francisco, CA-based multi-channel specialty retailer. The company has been benefiting from its focus on digital initiatives, higher e-commerce penetration and product introductions. Williams-Sonoma is capitalizing on its strategic emphasis on broadening its product range and establishing a sustainable operational framework.\n\nBy adopting a digital-first approach without exclusively relying on digital-only channels, the company has gained a competitive edge. Its strong e-commerce platform and successful Business-to-Business segment position it for substantial expansion, overcoming ongoing consumer spending challenges. The company\u2019s portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages are tailwinds.\n\nThe WSM stock \u2014 currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2014 has gained 90.4% over the past year. This company surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 17.8%. The estimated figure for fiscal 2025 indicates 2.6% year-over-year growth. It has a ROE of 51.6%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nFloor & Decor: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, this company serves as a multi-channel specialty retailer, offering hard surface flooring, related accessories, and commercial surfaces across Georgia and Florida. The company\u2019s continued expansion underscores its growth strategy. In the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Floor & Decor opened 11 new warehouse-format stores, bringing its total to 241 locations.\n\nThis reflects its commitment to capturing market share, especially as weaker competitors, such as Lumber Liquidators, close stores. Also, its strategic focus on higher-margin product categories, coupled with disciplined cost controls, has been contributing to margin improvement. Again, its connected customer initiatives and robust engagement with professional (Pro) customers have been growth pillars.\n\nThe FND stock has lost 3.1% over the past year. This company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 12.2%. The estimated figure for fiscal 2025 indicates 18% year-over-year growth. It also has a favorable VGM Score of B, with a Growth Score of B, making it a potentially interesting investment opportunity.\n\nHome Depot: Based in Atlanta, GA, Home Depot is the world\u2019s largest home improvement specialty retailer (based on sales), with 2,335 retail stores across the globe as of the end of fiscal 2023. Home Depot has continued to demonstrate consistent growth, driven by its strong leadership in the home improvement market and strategic investments in technology, digital innovation, and supply chain optimization under its \"One Home Depot\" initiative. By catering to both DIY enthusiasts and professional (Pro) contractors, Home Depot has solidified its position as a preferred destination for homeowners and industry experts alike.\n\nThe HD stock has gained 15% over the past year. This company, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), surpassed earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 2.3%. The estimated figure for fiscal 2025 indicates 3.5% year-over-year growth. It also has a favorable VGM Score of B, with a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nTempur Sealy: Based in Lexington, KY, Tempur Sealy designs, manufactures, distributes, and retails bedding products in the United States and internationally. Improved operational processes (particularly in markets outside the United States) and a solid contribution from the international segment (driven by successful new product launches) have been driving growth. Continued investment in product innovation, talent, and marketing has fortified Tempur Sealy\u2019s global presence and helped capture market share, especially in international markets.\n\nOperational streamlining and cost control initiatives have enabled the company to grow earnings despite industry-wide sales pressures. While the global bedding market remains below historical trends, Tempur Sealy outperformed competitors in sales growth in the third quarter, demonstrating resilience and effective market strategies.\n\nThe TPX stock has gained 14.2% over the past year. This company, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met in one and missed on another, the average being 0.9%. The estimated figure for fiscal 2025 indicates 14.2% year-over-year growth. It also has a favorable VGM Score of B, with a Value Score of B and Growth Score of A.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "Paint-splattered pants, shoes help FBI crack armored truck heist but hunt is on for $360K\n\nFederal agents are hunting for about $360,000 they said was stolen during a rare, armored truck heist in Metro Detroit characterized by the FBI as an inside job.\n\nFederal court records detail a lucrative robbery solved thanks to paint-splattered pants and stick-up shoes worn by the accused thief, 47-year-old Redford Township resident Antoine Ward. Prosecutors said he used countersurveillance strategies to avoid a web of high-tech gadgets installed in the region that read and record license plates from passing vehicles. So instead of driving, the FBI alleges Ward walked three miles and rode a bus to the crime scene but left behind other digital clues.\n\nThe heist happened amid a nationwide resurgence of robberies targeting armored cars and trucks, a crime that provides a quick opportunity for thieves to steal large amounts of money while exploiting security weaknesses at businesses.\n\nFBI crime statistics show there were at least 43 robberies of armored carriers nationwide in 2023 \u2014 the most in a decade. In 2023, the heists involved at least 122 thieves but investigators only managed to identify 29 suspects, illustrating the challenge facing agents tasked with catching criminals and recovering loot.\n\nInvestigators believed they caught at least one of two men accused of orchestrating the robbery of a Brink\u2019s Armored Courier driver at gunpoint outside a Home Depot in Harper Woods on Oct. 25. Investigators arrested Ward on Dec. 10, said they found the shoes he wore to the heist and uncovered a digital trail he traveled with his phone from his home to the Home Depot and back.\n\n\u201cThey did not locate the $360,000 that the defendant got away with,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Micah Wallace said during a Dec. 12 detention hearing in federal court in Detroit.\n\nThe number of armored carrier robberies in 2023 was nearly twice as many as a decade earlier, according to FBI statistics. Of the 22 robberies in 2013, robbers stole $6.1 million and investigators recovered less than $1.7 million.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s inability to find most of the stolen money despite searching Ward's home in early December is a plus for Ward, his lawyer, Stacey Studnicki, said during the hearing.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a factor that weighs in favor of (Ward),\u201d Studnicki said. \u201cThey did an exhaustive search. But they have no fingerprints. They have no DNA. They have physical evidence that was taken from the house \u2014 allegedly \u2014 but there\u2019s no expert testimony; only the testimony of an assistant U.S. attorney that these things match what happened in the robbery.\u201d\n\nWhat happened during robbery\n\nWard had more than great odds in his favor when the government said he arrived at the Home Depot on Kelly Road, south of W. Eight Mile, on Oct. 25. He had inside knowledge, according to the FBI.\n\nAt 4:16 p.m., a Brink's truck driver was robbed at gunpoint outside Home Depot. The driver told investigators he was at the store picking up a deposit when he was approached by a man holding a revolver and demanding money.\n\nThe robber was wearing a Brink's jacket, a black baseball hat, sunglasses, black pants, dark tan/brown shoes and a black face covering.\n\nThe robber stole the driver's pistol and ordered the driver inside the armored truck.\n\n\"The robber ordered the victim to handcuff himself to the steering wheel of the truck, and the victim complied,\" FBI Special Agent Jeffrey Sokolowski wrote in an affidavit.\n\nWhile inside the armored truck, the robber opened the vault, grabbed a bag filled with money and fled with the driver's pistol.\n\n\"In total, the robber took approximately $360,000 from the vault of the Brink\u2019s truck along with the monetary deposit from Home Depot (just under $30,000),\" the FBI agent wrote.\n\nThe robber never asked how to open or access the vault. That led FBI agents to conclude the robber likely was a current or former Brink's employee.\n\n\"... Brink\u2019s staff, including the drivers, knew that this location was particularly vulnerable to theft because of the blind exit from the Home Depot,\" the FBI agent wrote.\n\nInvestigators reviewed the store's surveillance video. The footage showed the robber ambush the driver in a blind spot outside the building, steal the money and flee.\n\nAs he fled south along Kelly Road, the thief appeared to drop the victim's pistol.\n\nHow feds identified suspect\n\nSurveillance footage from neighboring properties revealed the robber arrived at Home Depot around 1 p.m. \u2014 more than three hours before robbing the Brink's driver.\n\nAfter the theft, the robber was last seen on video near Edmore Drive, a block west of Home Depot. Investigators searched the area and found clothes, including a Brink's jacket, behind a garage.\n\n\"In a neighboring yard, officers found two deposit bags of cash from Home Depot along with a cash courier bag and two crumpled up work gloves matching the ones worn by the robber,\" the FBI agent wrote. \"The bag contained $29,305.81, the same amount taken from Home Depot.\"\n\nVideo from the Detroit Department of Transportation showed the robber get onto a city bus along W. Eight Mile earlier in the day of the robbery. In the video, he was wearing the same clothes shown on Home Depot footage of the theft.\n\nOne month later, on Nov. 25, investigators reviewed a list of current and former Brink's employees who matched the description of the robber. The FBI agent cross-referenced that list with a law enforcement database and learned Ward lived in Redford Township just south of W. Eight Mile and one mile west of where the robber was last seen on surveillance video.\n\nInvestigators also compared Ward's driver's license photo with the image of the robber and decided they were a close match.\n\nWard worked for Brink's for six years and would have worked on several routes, including one that included the Harper Woods location, the FBI agent said.\n\n\"Ward, as a former Brink\u2019s employee, would also know the pattern of the cash drop-offs and pickups, the security procedures used by the victim, the security protections of the vault, and the vulnerability of that particular Home Depot,\" the agent wrote.\n\nAnother digital trail detected\n\nNext, FBI agents obtained Ward's cell phone number from Brink's and got court-authorized search warrants for the phone's location history.\n\nThe data showed Ward's phone near his home in Redford Township on the morning of the robbery, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"The phone then moves towards the area of the Home Depot for several hours leading up to the robbery, remains there through the robbery, and is in the area for approximately one hour after the robbery,\" the FBI agent wrote.\n\nThe phone connected to cell towers near Eight Mile, consistent with video footage showing the robber walking three miles and boarding a city bus headed toward Harper Woods.\n\nAfter the robbery, cell phone data showed Ward's phone moving west from Home Depot and connecting with a cell tower near a bus stop in Eastpointe, according to the affidavit. Then the phone returned near Ward's home.\n\nInvestigators raided the home Dec. 9. They found four handguns, including a .38-caliber revolver registered to Ward.\n\n\"When shown a picture of the .38 caliber revolver (the third gun shown), the victim immediately stated 'this one for sure' and pointed out specifics of the revolver that matched his memory of the robber\u2019s gun,\" the FBI agent wrote.\n\nInvestigators also found shoes and black pants with paint stains consistent with a pair seen on surveillance footage, he added.\n\n\"The shoes had paint stains consistent with the surveillance video and one of the shoes was missing its laces which is also visible in the video,\" the agent wrote.\n\nWard was arrested Dec. 10 in Dearborn. He was indicted Dec. 19 on charges of interfering with commerce by robbery \u2014 a 20-year felony \u2014 and a firearm crime, a five-year felony.\n\nJudge disagrees with prosecutor\n\nWallace, the prosecutor, revealed during a detention hearing that they searched Ward's phone and found texts with a co-conspirator, another former Brink's employee.\n\n\"But for some family issues,\" Wallace said, \"there would have been two robbers.\n\n\"They had a significant amount of planning pre-robbery,\" he added. \"They tracked the trucks. They took videos of the trucks. The discussed whether or not they wanted to use a stolen plate or to remove the plate from their vehicle.\n\n\"And they were also planning a second robbery,\" Wallace said.\n\nIn one text exchange from early October, three weeks before the Home Depot robbery, Ward makes an apparent reference to part of Metro Detroit being the \"Truck 61 area.\"\n\n\"The reason why that\u2019s important is that 'Truck 61' was the truck that Mr. Ward robbed,\" Wallace said.\n\nIn another exchange, Ward warned the co-conspirator to \"be ready to move\" and \"take your (license) plate off.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he knew that if he took his truck, his plate would be clocked and he would be an immediate suspect,\u201d Wallace said.\n\nThe prosecutor tried to keep Ward in jail while awaiting trial, arguing he is dangerous and a flight risk.\n\n\u201cHis dangerousness is evident,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe planned, ambushed and attacked a Brink\u2019s driver that he knew was armed. (Ward) has, somewhere around his life, $360,000, which means if he is released, he can hide that money, and he can use that money to get away.\u201d\n\nWard\u2019s lawyer pushed for bond. Ward is a high school graduate and a married father of four daughters with no criminal record, Studnicki noted.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Kimberly Altman released Ward on a $10,000 unsecured bond.\n\n\"There\u2019s no questions that the circumstances that have been alleged here are very serious. These are serious charges,\" Altman said.\n\nBut she noted Ward has \"virtually no criminal history,\" has family ties to Metro Detroit, family support and a history of employment.\n\n\"It was just a puzzle to me how this case even came about,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman placed Ward on house arrest and imposed \"very strict\" zero-tolerance bond conditions. Those included barring Ward from having any contact with the alleged co-conspirator, ordering him to wear a GPS tether and naming his wife as a third-party custodian.\n\n\"This is not just on you,\" Altman said. \"You're putting your compliance on her, too.\"\n\nrsnell@detroitnews.com",

            "content": "E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN -2.51%) trounced the market in 2024, with its share price climbing 45% compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC -1.39%) 24% gains (as of this writing). Meanwhile, Home Depot's (HD -4.19%) shares struggled, gaining just 12.4% for the year amid a slowdown in DIY home improvement spending.\n\nBoth of these consumer goods companies are leaders in their respective markets and, while their current share price gains don't compare, either could be great long-term investments. But which is the better buy right now? Let's take a look.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon is, of course, a dominant e-commerce company that also has its hands in a range of things from cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI). While not all of its endeavors are successful, many avenues Amazon pursues often work out well for the company, making the stock a no-brainer buy for many investors.\n\nConsider that Amazon has 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market, easily outpacing rival Walmart, which has just over 7% market share. This lead translates to massive sales, with North American revenue rising 9% in the third quarter (ended Sept. 30) to $95.5 billion.\n\nAmazon recently launched a new, lower-priced version of its marketplace called Amazon Haul to maintain its lead and fight off increasing competition. The mobile-only e-commerce platform is Amazon's answer to China-based Temu (owned by PDD Holdings) and gives U.S. customers access to items priced under $20.\n\nThat move should help Amazon stay even more competitive in e-commerce, but it's the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that is the true key to its success.\n\nAWS' operating income rose nearly 50% in the third quarter to $10.4 billion, and Amazon likely has many more years of AWS growth ahead of it. The company already holds 31% of the cloud computing market, and spending on cloud data centers is accelerating. Goldman Sachs estimates revenue from the entire cloud computing market will reach $2 trillion by 2030, thanks to a rapid increase in AI spending.\n\nSome investors may overlook Amazon because they believe its best days are behind it, but with the company's continued dominance in e-commerce and its expanding cloud operating income as AI investments accelerate, there's likely more growth ahead for Amazon.\n\nThe case for Home Depot\n\nHome Depot is the leader in DIY home improvement, with more than $40 billion in sales in the third quarter (ended Oct. 27), compared to rival Lowe's $20 billion in revenue. But despite its lead, Home Depot is struggling a bit.\n\nThe company's same-store sales fell 1.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, an indication that customers aren't as eager to walk through its doors and make purchases as they were this time last year. Home Depot management doesn't expect the remainder of the year to be much better, estimating a 2.5% decline in comparable sales for the fiscal year.\n\nThe North American home improvement market was worth $667 billion in 2023 and will reach an estimated $1.2 trillion by 2032. While Home Depot will benefit from this, the current slowdown in customer spending means the company will have to wait a little longer before customers are eager to jump into DIY projects again.\n\n\"We continue to see pressure on larger remodeling projects, driven by the higher interest rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said during the most recent earnings call. Decker is optimistic that demand will return to normal, but added, \"We just don't think we're quite there yet.\"\n\nThe verdict: Amazon is the better buy now\n\nHome Depot's shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.8, compared to Amazon's forward P/E ratio of 35.7. That makes Home Depot's stock less expensive than Amazon's, but I still don't think it's the better buy.\n\nIf the housing market has shown anything over the past few years, it's that no one can reliably predict where it's going. Home Depot's management doesn't seem confident that it's out of the woods just yet with comparable-store sales slowdowns, which means it might be better to put your money toward Amazon's stock for now.\n\nOf course, if you're willing to be patient for home improvement spending to increase again, adding some Home Depot stock amid its recent share price pullback probably isn't a bad idea either.",

            "content": "Home Depot navigated a challenging 2024 marked by elevated interest rates and a cautious consumer. But as the year progressed, signs of recovery emerged, setting the stage for a rebound in 2025, fueled by increased housing turnover and pent-up demand in the home improvement market. Year-to-date performance: up 12% Forward price-to-earnings multiple: 25 versus a five-year average of 21.5 Our rating: Buy-equivalent 1 Our price target: $440 a share HD YTD mountain Home Depot year to date performance. '24 look back Home Depot had a rollercoaster year in 2024, starting slow in a high-rate environment before finding momentum later in the year. The stock was subdued through the first half as elevated borrowing costs weighed on big-ticket home improvement projects. Things started to shift in March, when expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts lifted sentiment, pushing the stock higher. However, those gains were short-lived as investor expectations reset in May. The real turning point came in mid-September when the Fed kicked off its monetary easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point rate cut. This sparked optimism about the housing turnover, which hit a 30-year low earlier in the year. Home Depot shares climbed steadily, reaching an all-time intraday high of nearly $440 on Nov. 26. Since then, the stock has pulled back more than 11% as of Monday trading. Over that stretch, the S & P 500 has been relatively flat. Still, Home Depot is among Jim Cramer's 12 core holdings. We initiated our position in Home Depot in early September , betting that falling mortgage rates could spark activity in the languishing housing sector. Despite two more Fed rate cuts for a total of 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, of easing in 2024, the 10-year Treasury yield remained elevated. Mortgage rates take their cues from bond yields \u2014 so the cost of home loans also remained elevated, which has pushed out the expectations for a housing formation recovery and the subsequent business Home Depot would get to as a result. '25 look ahead Home Depot is gearing up for a comeback in 2025, with early signs of recovery already evident. The company's third-quarter results , reported in mid-November, hinted that its business is bottoming out and poised to inflect positively next year. As housing turnover picks up, driven by eventually falling mortgage rates, demand for home improvement projects is expected to rise. The Fed projected two more rate cuts in 2025. Since there won't be a huge ramp-up in new homes built next year, people will have to buy older U.S. homes, which need of upgrades and repairs. Whether it's contracting professionals or do-it-yourself shoppers, Home Depot remains the go-to destination for home renovation supplies. We prefer Home Depot to rival Lowe's because it is more exposed to the pro market. Home Depot beefed up its presence among professional contractors through its recent acquisition of SRS Distribution, a network of independent roofing and building supplies distributors. Rates remain the key to Home Depot's turnaround. If mortgage rates drop below 6%, the company's comparable sales should return to positive territory in time, reversing the weakness in big-ticket projects. The prospect of further Fed easing is likely to support the stock since home improvement stocks tend to rise as rates fall, given they're inversely related. This should be followed by earnings growth at Home Depot. But there is a risk that longer-term bond yields \u2014 which mortgage rates track more closely \u2014 will continue to rise. This could delay Home Depot's return to growth. While it is possible that Home Depot could have some tariff issues as it relates to its exposure to Mexico, Canada, and China, the retailer should be less vulnerable given over half of their portfolio is sourced from the U.S. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HD.
