            "content": "He adds, \u201cIn nephrology, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a fundamental aspect of our field. Currently, around 1 in 10 people are affected by CKD, and the incidence has significantly increased over time. Under standing the definition of CKD highlights the importance of early detection and appropriate testing, as managing CKD is essential to controlling the disease, as it cannot be reversed. This requires careful management of the available treatments and consistent monitoring\u201d.During his residency, Dr Gaurav gained extensive experience with kidney transplants, having observed around 100 to 200 procedures over three years. He possesses a strong interest in performing transplants and strives to continue to do so in his freelance practice. If a kidney disease patient\u2019s kidney has stopped functioning, a transplant is the best option in terms of treatment. One of the latest advancements in kidney transplantation is the ABO incompatible transplant.Dr Gaurav holds experience with such kidney transplants too, ie. involving different blood groups, for instance, facilitating a donation from a patient with blood group B to one with blood group O. These cases come with their own challenges, but it has been a rewarding experience for him and he is passionate about this aspect of his practice.It is often said that prevention is better than cure, and the same goes for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, initial prevention is crucial. The most important factor is diet and thus, all patients should follow a carefully considered eating plan. Dr Gaurav says, \u201cAs nephro -logists in Mumbai, we emphasize the principle of \u2018One teaspoon less\u2019, advocating for reduced salt intake to support kidney health. We recommend at least 30 minutes of daily exercise and a low-salt diet, favoring plant-based proteins over non-vegetarian options. It\u2019s also important to avoid over-the-counter painkillers and stay hydrated. By adopting these changes, patients can enhance their kidney health and overall well-being\u201d.Dr Gaurav\u2019s nephrology career has been enriching handling different critical and unique patient cases. Recently, he treated a patient who had acute kidney injury with creatinine of 11 secondary to over the counter drugs (acute kidney injury is reversible while chronic kidney disease is not). Another patient from Calcutta mentioned consuming a specific type of fish, leading Dr Gaurav and his team to suspicion of acute interstitial nephritis which was confirmed on kidney biopsy.After treatment with steroids, her creatinine levels successfully returned to normal.

Trackwise Manufacturing is one of the first in the life sciences industry to offer a revolutionary new approach to workflow management that bridges the gap between the digital and physical manufacturing environments.\n\nMost organisations in the life sciences manufacturing sector still rely on paper-based methods for workflow management, leading to errors and inefficiencies that cause data to go unused and can delay the introduction of new drugs, resulting in profit loss per drug. To address these challenges, TrackWise Manufacturing enables organisations to digitise operations and automate workflows through AI-assisted processes that can help companies to bring drugs to market faster and safer.\n\nThe solution is built on a new containerised platform that allows software applications to run consistently across different computing environments, eliminating the need for complex, siloed integrations. As a result, manufacturers can achieve greater flexibility and efficiency, allowing them to respond quicker to business needs and regulatory changes.\n\n\u201cTrackWise Manufacturing is designed to advance the industry\u2019s inefficient systems by leveraging Honeywell\u2019s extensive expertise in automation technologies and life science compliance,\u201d said Pramesh Maheshwari, President of Honeywell Process Solutions. \u201cBy embedding AI-assisted workflows, we are leveraging automation to help life science manufacturers reduce technology transfer times and get products to patients faster.\u201d\n\nBy harnessing the capabilities of TrackWise Manufacturing, organisations can not only optimise process execution but can also safeguard operational continuity. The platform\u2019s containerised architecture supports flexibility and adaptability, empowering manufacturers to adjust swiftly to evolving market demands while staying compliant with regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cIn the face of economic pressures, shifting market demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, the Life Sciences industry is at an inflection point,\u201d said Daniel R. Matlis, President and Founder at Axendia, Inc. \u201cIndustry leaders must seize the opportunity to transform and leverage technological advancements to unify digital quality and manufacturing. Embracing modern technologies, Industry can significantly enhance operational effectiveness, improve product quality, streamline regulatory compliance, and accelerate time to market.\u201d\n\nThe platform leverages Honeywell\u2019s established Unit Operations Controller (UOC) for critical control functions while seamlessly embedding an industry-first quality framework that promotes true quality-by-design manufacturing. By embedding quality metrics into the manufacturing process, this framework changes how manufacturers handle production and compliance, which can ultimately result in faster time to market for products.\n\nTrackWise Manufacturing expands on Honeywell\u2019s TrackWise platform and its 30-year quality management legacy that has helped life sciences organisations get safe products to market in a timely manner. The platform\u2019s launch marks a significant leap forward in the evolution of manufacturing technology, unifying various operational functions to streamline processes, enhance operational efficiency, and accelerate product time-to-market.",

Technologies based on Rydberg atomic vapors hold the potential to enable new capabilities in RF electrometry, imaging, and communications.\n\nRelated: Wanted: enabling technologies in atomic vapors for electric field sensing in electronic warfare (EW)\n\nStill, Rydberg-based technologies have high sensitivity, fragility, and technical complexities, and have problems that have impeded rapid maturation.\n\nInstead, the EQSTRA program seeks to enhance the capabilities of Rydberg-based technologies extending into the millimeter-wave domain; accelerate Rydberg-based technology development to high TRL and quantum-limited performance; and study Rydberg-based vapor technologies for U.S. military such as quantum-enhanced sensing, imaging, and communications.\n\nBuilding on SAVaNT\n\nEQSTRA seeks to build on the DARPA Science of Atomic Vapors for New Technologies (SAVaNT) program to advance the performance, capabilities, and application landscape of Rydberg-vapor technologies for QIS, quantum-enhanced electrometry, imaging, and communications.\n\nThe SAVaNT program, launched in August 2020, sought to develop techniques to mitigate the effects of thermal motion and decoherence within broad categories of vapor-based sensing technologies, and demonstrate new levels of sensitivity, accuracy, and detection bandwidth in vapor-based magnetometers and electrometers.\n\nRelated: ColdQuanta eyes quantum applications in electronic warfare (EW), sensors, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW)\n\nDARPA awarded a $3.6 million SAVaNT contract in April 2021 to ColdQuanta Inc. in Boulder, Colo., to advance the performance of atomic vapors for electric field sensing in applications ranging from airborne electronic warfare (EW) to naval anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The program aimed to advance the integration of Rydberg-based electrometers to demonstrate a tabletop physics package.\n\nNow researchers want to learn more, through four EQSTRA focus areas: developing atomically referenced tunable, narrow line-width sources of terahertz radiation; developing small and lightweight integrated Rydberg electrometers; developing wafer-scale vapor cells for wideband Rydberg electrometry; and studying Rydberg-based quantum technologies.\n\nFor more information contact Honeywell International online at https://automation.honeywell.com/us/en/products/sensing-solutions/sensors/gas-sensors, or DARPA at www.darpa.mil. Email questions or concerns to DARPA's Mukund Vengalattore, the EQSTRA program manager, at [email protected].",

            "content": "With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Honeywell Automation India (NSE:HONAUT). It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Honeywell Automation India is:\n\n14% = \u20b95.3b \u00f7 \u20b938b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every \u20b91 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20b90.14 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nHoneywell Automation India's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Honeywell Automation India's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 12%, we may spare it some thought. Having said that, Honeywell Automation India's net income growth over the past five years is more or less flat. Bear in mind, the company's ROE is not very high. So that could also be one of the reasons behind the company's flat growth in earnings.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Honeywell Automation India's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 29% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Honeywell Automation India's's valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Honeywell Automation India Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nHoneywell Automation India has a low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.\n\nIn addition, Honeywell Automation India has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 19%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 16%.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Honeywell Automation India's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

            "content": "AVALON AIR SHOW \u2014 Transferring defense technology from one country to another is typically a complicated affair. But a new pilot program Honeywell recently secured from the US Navy for one stage of the AUKUS program \u2014 the sale of Virginia-class submarines from the US to Australia \u2014 aims to smooth out the process to get the submarine industrial base stood up as quickly as possible, according to a company executive.\n\n\u201cWe have 200 factories around the world, and we produce over 160,000 parts,\u201d Lee Davis, Honeywell\u2019s senior director for defense and space in Australia, said in an interview today here at the Avalon Air Show just outside of Melbourne. \u201cSo we know how to manage security. We know how to manage supply chains. So the reason the US Navy picked us for this program was, how do you do the technology transfer of sensitive Virginia-class information to Australia?\u201d\n\nSpeaking over the roar of a Royal Australian Air Force jet performing aerial acrobatics at the show, Davis quipped, \u201cWe even have content in that F/A-18.\u201d\n\nThrough the pilot program, announced March 17, Honeywell is now tasked with helping establish an early industrial base to supply parts for the Virginias and to sustain them when they arrive down under, specifically by identifying local suppliers who could build parts and securely transferring requisite data and intellectual property through a digital cloud environment. In the longer term, those vendors would then be \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to support the eventual production of homegrown, SSN-AUKUS nuclear powered submarines that will be built in the Lucky Country and incorporate technologies from the US and UK, Davis said.\n\nThe two-year pilot initially aims to pick \u201caround\u201d five vendors to produce five parts, Davis explained, with a focus on \u201celectromechanical complex assemblies\u201d that can involve products owned by Honeywell, as well as those licensed by the US government and third parties. The company has identified over 1,500 suppliers so far and will now be tasked with whittling that number down. (Other government-led pilot programs, like the DIVQ and AUSS-Q efforts, will involve related AUKUS tasks like shipbuilding.)\n\n\u201cTo be effective in the Virginia program, we need to build a large number of suppliers, so we need to be able to do this technology transfer process securely and quickly. So that\u2019s the real driver behind the pilot, is quickly demonstrate a security framework through the program, which essentially harmonizes US security requirements, Australian security requirements, and applies those security requirements based on the level of classification of the part,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAs part of the AUKUS agreement, new laws and policies were issued to amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which governs most US defense exports. A system or component must be on the US Munitions List to be subject to ITAR; if they are, an arms export license must be obtained from the State Department\u2019s Political-Military Bureau. The legal presumption the bureaucracy operates under is that they should reject the license application by default and need a strong case made for why it should be approved \u2014 often a lengthy and complex process, one that companies large and small bridle at. Foreign countries are in the same position.\n\nBut under the new rule, \u201cmost military and dual-use goods\u201d can be shared between the three countries, an Australian defense official previously said.\n\nLeveraging that new arrangement can help shave off anywhere from three to six months of time, Davis added, though he noted not necessarily every part can be handed over through that arrangement and that required licensing work will need to be coordinated. Honeywell will help with the testing and qualification process for parts as well, Davis said.\n\nThe process can essentially drop the need for government middlemen that are often involved in tech exchanges. Instead of traditional approaches where a source supplier transfers their information to their host government, who in turn shares it with the receiving government that would then hand that data over to the company doing the work in the respective country, the pilot program intends to \u201cconnect the current producer and the end producer\u2026 so that transfer can happen business-to-business,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAlthough AUKUS pilot programs largely entail the transfer of US technical capabilities to Australia, the exchange isn\u2019t a one-way street, Davis said. Australia is accustomed to \u201cdo[ing] more with less,\u201d he said, whose skills in areas like additive manufacturing have garnered interest from the US Navy.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s just a pilot program, but Honeywell could be picked to scale that work up once AUKUS work kicks into higher gear. Virginia-class subs have over a million parts, Davis noted, \u201cAnd so, you know, I can see that we would need to scale this into the low 1,000s of parts and suppliers\u201d for the AUKUS program that is expected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of the effort.\n\n\u201cThe long-term play for Honeywell is, we want to be able to expand our capacity and meet demand with increased and resilient supply chains,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe organization sees Australia as a good place to invest in a secure, like-minded nation.\u201d\n\nStill, the new Trump administration that has led historical allies to question their relationship with Washington has raised concerns among some about the future of AUKUS.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of hearsay going around at the moment, but I think when you when you talk to the main players, I mean, the Australian government\u2019s being pretty clear that AUKUS is part of their defense strategy, and it\u2019s a critical piece moving forward, they\u2019re not making any signals in other areas to change that,\u201d Davis said, pointing to other frequently touted AUKUS benefits like the support of US deployed forces.\n\n\u201cSo, when you look at these things strategically, I personally think it makes a lot of sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everything I\u2019ve seen from governments so far aligns with that.\u201d",

In comparison, the S&P 500 has declined 3.3% in the same period. The company has also underperformed its key rivals like RTX and Griffon.

Softness in the warehouse and workflow solutions businesses, due to lower demand for projects, has been affecting the segment's performance. Also, the weakened demand for its products and solutions within the sensing and safety technologies business is worrisome.\n\n\n\nContinued softness in the warehouse automation business, owing to lower investments in the market, remains concerning for the segment. In fourth-quarter 2024, Honeywell\u2019s Industrial Automation segment\u2019s sales declined 1% on a year-over-year basis. For 2025, it anticipates the Industrial Automation segment\u2019s organic sales to decline in the low-single digits.\n\n\n\nHigh long-term debt remains a major concern for Honeywell.

HON is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.3X compared with the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s 16.67X. With a Value Score of D, HON stock may not present a compelling value proposition at these levels.\n\n\n\nThe current valuation is above its five-year median of 19.84X. In comparison with HON\u2019s valuation, its peers 3M Company MMM, RTX Corporation RTX and Griffon Corporation GFF are trading at 18.72X, 21.22X and 11.51X, respectively. The company\u2019s premium valuation compared with the broader industry raises concerns.\n\nValuation Remains an Overhang for Honeywell\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHON Stock\u2019s Price Performance\n\nYear to date, Honeywell stock has lost 5.2% against the industry\u2019s 1.8% growth. In comparison, the S&P 500 has declined 3.3% in the same period. The company has also underperformed its key rivals like RTX and Griffon. Over the same time frame, RTX and Griffon have returned 15.3% and 1%, respectively.\n\nHON\u2019s YTD Price Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOngoing Challenges Faced by Honeywell\n\nHoneywell has been witnessing persistent weakness in the Industrial Automation segment.

We're here to help you find the perfect fit for winter. Hector Roqueta Rivero/Getty Images Space heater price Most electric space heaters that operate solely in that function (and not as a dual air purifier) are priced below $150, with many models on this list costing less than $100. Several smaller, well-regarded budget models may even run you less than $50. The size of the unit, additional features, number of settings and heating element all contribute to the overall cost of a space heater. Space heater size There are no standard sizes or shapes for electric space heaters, and most of the space heaters I researched did not specify the square footage for coverage, other than to mention its capacity to heat a \"small to medium\" space or to specify room types such as a bedroom or office. Space heaters may be indicated as tabletop, floor or bathroom models and many also come as tall but narrow \"tower\" models, which may or may not oscillate, that have a smaller footprint and therefore a smaller horizontal space requirement. Types of space heaters While this list consists only of electric space heaters, (as opposed to water- or oil-heated models,) there are several different mechanisms that electric space heaters may utilize to create heated air. Fan-forced: Fan-forced space heaters circulate air by pulling it into the unit and passing it over a heating element, typically metal coils, expelling the heated air through exhaust vents in the unit. Infrared: Infrared bulbs are those which convert electricity into radiant heat. This is the least common type among the space heaters we included here, but no less effective. Ceramic: Ceramic space heaters utilize electricity to heat a ceramic plate within the unit, which then emits radiant heat into the air, with or without the additional use of a fan. Show more",

            "content": "India\u2019s aviation sector is soaring to new heights, as reflected in record-breaking aircraft orders and a surge in air travel demand. Recognizing this momentum, Honeywell Aerospace is deepening its presence in the country, leveraging its engineering expertise, expanding supply chain networks, and strengthening defence collaborations. With the government\u2019s push for self-reliance and the rapid expansion of the aviation sector, India presents a significant growth opportunity. In a recent conversation with Shereen Bhan, Managing Editor of CNBC-TV18, Jim Currier, President and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, outlined the company\u2019s ambitious vision for India\u2019s aviation future.India is fast becoming a key market for Honeywell Aerospace, both as a demand hub and a supply base. Currier highlighted two critical aspects of Honeywell\u2019s growing footprint in the country: technology and engineering, and supply chain localization.Engineering & Innovation: For over two decades, Honeywell has invested in India\u2019s engineering talent, establishing three Centers of Excellence (COEs) and employing more than 3,000 aerospace engineers. These centers play a crucial role in global product development, working on cutting-edge avionics, engines, and safety systems. \u201cThe innovation coming out of India is incredible. Indian engineers are at the forefront of developing cutting-edge aerospace technologies, from avionics to AI-driven automation,\u201d said Currier.Beyond R&D, India\u2019s expertise in software development, AI, and digital aviation solutions is transforming it into a strategic hub for Honeywell\u2019s next-generation aerospace initiatives. Advanced navigation systems, predictive maintenance software, and AI-powered automation are just a few of the breakthroughs being developed by Indian engineers, shaping the future of flight technology.Supply Chain & Localization: The Indian government\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative is accelerating localization efforts, encouraging global players like Honeywell to expand domestic manufacturing and supplier networks. \u201cWe are looking to quadruple our sourcing from India in the next few years. This will create immense opportunities for India\u2019s industrial supply base,\u201d Currier noted.The continued expansion of the aerospace sector is expected to integrate more local firms into Honeywell\u2019s supply chain, driving job creation and industrial growth. Strengthening domestic manufacturing not only enhances operational efficiency but also reinforces India\u2019s position as a reliable aerospace supplier on the global stage.With a rapidly growing aviation market, the demand for robust Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) infrastructure is more critical than ever. Airlines are keen to reduce maintenance costs and turnaround times by establishing in-country capabilities rather than relying on overseas repair facilities.To address this need, Honeywell is actively exploring investments in local MRO facilities to support the expanding aircraft fleet. \u201cWith over a thousand new aircraft expected in the Indian market, a strong MRO ecosystem is vital. We are in discussions about developing local capabilities to meet these demands,\u201d Currier confirmed. Strengthening MRO capabilities will not only support commercial aviation but also enhance India\u2019s defence aviation sector, creating a self-sufficient ecosystem for aircraft maintenance and repair.In addition to traditional MRO services, Honeywell is leveraging digital tools to improve predictive maintenance, helping airlines reduce unplanned downtime and optimize operational efficiency. AI-powered diagnostics and real-time monitoring solutions will be key differentiators, ensuring better aircraft performance and reliability.Opportunities in India\u2019s defence sector continue to grow, with the government\u2019s push for localization and self-reliance in defence technology aligning well with Honeywell\u2019s capabilities. \u201cMany of our products have dual-use applications for both commercial and military aircraft. As India transitions from a net importer to a net exporter of defence technology, we see strong opportunities to contribute through technology and local manufacturing,\u201d Currier explained.Honeywell is actively collaborating with Indian defence organizations to co-develop avionics, propulsion systems, and mission-critical technologies. Its expertise in defence avionics, tactical communication, and cyber-security solutions supports India\u2019s modernisation plans for its air force and naval aviation. Strengthening partnerships with Indian manufacturers and government entities will be crucial in helping India achieve self-sufficiency in defence aviation.While global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties pose challenges, Honeywell remains committed to long-term growth in India. As the aerospace industry evolves, adaptability and resilience are essential. The company is working closely with Indian suppliers to mitigate supply chain risks while ensuring quality and compliance with global aviation standards.Sustainability is another critical focus area. The rising demand for sustainable aviation solutions presents an opportunity for Honeywell to drive innovation. Investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electric propulsion, and hybrid aircraft technologies will see significant contributions from its India-based R&D teams, positioning the company at the forefront of the industry\u2019s shift toward greener aviation.As India solidifies its position in global aviation, Honeywell\u2019s deepening engagement in the country signals a dynamic and promising new chapter, both for the company and the Indian aerospace industry. \u201cIndia will play a crucial role in our global strategy, whether through engineering advancements, supply chain expansion, or defence collaboration,\u201d Currier emphasised.Through continuous investments in technology, workforce development, and infrastructure, Honeywell aims to be a key enabler of India\u2019s aerospace ambitions, supporting both commercial and defence aviation with world-class solutions.",

The mechanism aims to solicit new businesses by giving more play to leading investment banks, law firms, consulting firms, and companies taking core role in the industrial chain. This mechanism has been introduced to address the new trends in global economic integration and China's economic transformation and upgrading.\n\nAiming to attract 298 billion yuan ($41 billion) of investment in 2025, Pudong has managed to land over 100 billion yuan of investment in the first quarter. According to Wang Yihua, head of Pudong's investment promotion services center, projects concerning integrated circuit, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, culture and tourism have made up the most of the first quarter investment.\n\nWu Jincheng, head of Pudong New Area, said at the Thursday conference that continued efforts will be made to direct more market resources to the development of new quality productive forces.\n\nOn one hand, industrial parks should attract more industry leaders while seeking differentiated positioning. More intelligent manufacturing space should be promoted in Pudong, including creating industrial spaces in buildings and introducing more low-cost land and land for comprehensive purposes. While 7.44 square-kilometer of low efficiency industrial land was better used in 2024, another 4.96 sq km of such space will be revitalized this year, said Wu.\n\nAs of end 2024, Pudong is home to 1,285 private fund managers, with the asset under management exceeding 1.79 trillion yuan. The area's total balance of technology loans was more than 350 billion yuan at the end of last year.\n\nThe area's three State-backed fund of funds saw their combined value approaching 60 billion yuan.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, expressed his frustration on March 19 about how investors often get caught up in discussions revolving around the Federal Reserve, interest rates, and the President\u2019s trade policies, overlooking other important factors.\n\n\u201cEvery now and then, we want to make money in the worst way, and when I say the worst way, I mean the dumbest way. We wind up talking endlessly about the Fed and interest rates or the President\u2019s trade policy, whether it\u2019s punitive tariffs, reciprocal tariffs. Oh man, come on.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Talked About 7 Stocks & Stagflation Fears and Jim Cramer Recently Talked About These 12 Companies\n\nOn Wednesday, Cramer noted that investors reacted to the Fed\u2019s open market committee meeting results with the same old rhetoric. The Fed announced, without any surprise, that it was leaving rates unchanged, and the market responded positively to the news.\n\nCramer clarified, however, that he recognizes the significance of the Federal Reserve in influencing market trends. He acknowledged that any negative remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, like signaling that inflation is still out of control or that tariffs might lead to higher prices, pushing the Fed to raise interest rates, or eliminating the possibility of rate cuts, would indeed have a damaging effect. But, he emphasized, none of that came to pass on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s more to this market than the day-to-day action, which is why I want to focus on the bigger long-term themes for you.\u201d\n\nCramer argued that, even with changes in interest rates, these long-term stories will be what really matters. Among these enduring trends, Cramer spotlighted artificial intelligence. He called the cooling off in AI investments in recent months \u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nHe maintained that AI is a multi-trillion-dollar force that will continue to drive market growth and innovation. Cramer pointed out that the U.S. is grappling with a significant labor shortage, and robots, capable of handling tedious, hazardous, and undesirable tasks, are here to stay. AI\u2019s influence, according to Cramer, is unstoppable, unaffected by the Federal Reserve or even trade policies.",

Growing demand for dependable energy, integration of renewable energy, energy security, regulatory backing, improvements in energy storage technology, and the requirement for sustainable, decentralized power solutions are the main factors propelling the microgrid industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing Industry Infrastructure for Renewable Energy\n\n\n\nMicrogrids are being used by industries more and more to integrate renewable energy sources into their processes. These systems contribute to the achievement of sustainability goals by supplying dependable, clean energy for extensive industrial operations. In addition, microgrids' scalability enables them to meet the energy requirements of both ongoing operations and planned expansions. For instance, Precision Castparts Corp. established a titanium melt facility that runs entirely on renewable energy, while BHE Renewables announced plans in September 2024 to turn more than 2,000 acres in West Virginia into an industrial estate powered by a microgrid. Consequently, the market is experiencing notable economic growth.\n\n\n\nGrowing Funding for Sustainable Energy Initiatives\n\n\n\nAs part of broader initiatives to switch to sustainable energy, governments and private businesses are making significant investments in microgrid technology. The goal of these expenditures is to create energy systems that are more robust and efficient. They support the larger objective of lowering carbon emissions by promoting innovation in the production, delivery, and storage of renewable energy. For example, Alternus Clean Energy and Hover Energy formed a joint venture in August 2024 to offer next-generation microgrid solutions for commercial clients and data centers. With more than 60MW of developed project capacity, the partnership uses solar and wind technology to help achieve net-zero carbon emissions targets.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Attention to Energy Cost Reduction\n\n\n\nBy allowing towns and companies to produce and store their own electricity, microgrids lessen reliance on the main grid and cut long-term energy expenses. Additionally, by optimizing energy use through localized management and storage, they can effectively manage peak demand and save energy expenses. For example, Schneider Electric introduced an all-in-one battery energy storage system (BESS) in April 2024 that is intended to provide scalable and adaptable energy solutions. It complies with stringent safety regulations in international markets while integrating with microgrid systems to improve energy resilience, cost savings, and sustainability.\n\n\n\nHigh Initial Costs\n\n\n\nIn the microgrid sector, high initial costs pose a serious obstacle. Significant infrastructure investments are needed to create a microgrid, including energy storage devices, sophisticated management systems to oversee grid operations, and renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines. The requirement for specialist equipment and connection with the grid's current infrastructure also drives up costs. Especially for small firms, underdeveloped nations, and communities with little financial means, these large initial expenses may be a deterrent. The initial financial burden may postpone the adoption and growth of microgrids, even though long-term savings and the advantages of energy resilience may balance these costs.\n\n\n\nRegulatory and Policy Barriers\n\n\n\nThe microgrid market has a number of obstacles due to regulations and policies. Investors and microgrid developers face uncertainties due to regionally inconsistent legislation and a lack of common policies. Integration of decentralized energy sources with the wider grid is hampered in many places by antiquated legislation. Furthermore, lengthy and complicated permitting procedures might cause delays in project completion dates. Notwithstanding the potential advantages of microgrids for energy resilience and sustainability, the lack of clear incentives or support for adoption deters investments and further restricts the systems' widespread deployment.\n\n\n\nMicrogrid Market Overview by Regions\n\n\n\nDue to robust technology breakthroughs, energy security concerns, and supporting legislation, North America is dominating the world's microgrid market, which is expanding globally. Europe comes next, emphasizing the integration of renewable energy. The Asia-Pacific area is growing quickly due to rising infrastructure and energy demands.

Concerns about energy security, the need for grid upgrading, and the growing use of renewable energy sources are important growth drivers. The Department of Energy's funding programs are one example of the positive government policies and incentives that support the integration of renewable energy in the United States. The market is also developing as a result of the increasing need for microgrids in critical infrastructure, military installations, and isolated locations. The efficiency and feasibility of microgrids in a variety of U.S. sectors are being improved by technological developments in energy storage and management systems. The Los Angeles Transportation Department organized a new microgrid project in November 2021 to electrify EVs. It is anticipated that the microgrid, which has a solar and storage power supply system, will serve as the fleet's charging station. The California Energy Commission awarded a USD 6 million grant to Proterra Energy to develop the project. An estimated 7.5 MW of power generation is anticipated.\n\n\n\nGermany Microgrid Market\n\n\n\nGermany's strong commitment to renewable energy and energy transition goals is driving the country's microgrid market's expansion. Adoption of decentralized energy solutions is encouraged by the government's backing of renewable energy laws and programs like the Energiewende. In order to improve energy resilience and incorporate renewable resources like solar and wind, microgrids are being utilized more and more in distant locations, industrial sites, and energy communities. Microgrid expansion is further aided by technological developments in energy storage and grid management technologies, which foster a more dependable and sustainable energy infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIndia Microgrid Market\n\n\n\nThe demand for dependable electricity in rural and isolated locations is propelling the microgrid industry in India to rapid growth. Microgrids are a feasible option for decentralized electricity because of the nation's abundant renewable energy resources, especially solar power. Microgrid adoption is encouraged by favorable policies and government programs such as the National Smart Grid Mission. For instance, in four Indian states - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan - the Rockfeller Foundation set up about 160 microgrids. More than 70,000 people in isolated locations now have access to energy because to this program. Microgrids present India with a chance to expand energy access, incorporate renewable energy sources, and boost resilience, particularly in underserved areas, in light of rising energy consumption, grid dependability issues, and an emphasis on sustainability.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia Microgrid Market\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's drive to diversify its energy sector and increase energy reliability is driving growth in the microgrid market. Microgrids are a key part of the government's Vision 2030 plan, which prioritizes sustainability, the integration of renewable energy, and the modernization of energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia is investigating microgrids to maximize energy distribution, particularly in rural locations and for vital infrastructure, thanks to its enormous solar resources. Government incentives for renewable energy projects assist the market, and microgrids are being used more and more to improve resilience and energy security. Microgrids are anticipated to be essential to reaching sustainability targets as the country transitions to greener energy.",

Most importantly, it will increase efficiency in the repair pool and reduce turnaround times for maintenance and repair of the F-35 fleet in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with RFD Australia is a defining moment as we work together to strengthen the local F35 maintenance, repair and overhaul capabilities in Australia to support the Royal Australian Air Force and the APAC fleet,\u201d said Honeywell Aerospace\u2019s Lee Davis. \u201cThe activation of the RFD Australia depot will enhance mission continuity and improve F-35 sustainment activities across Asia Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cRFD Australia has a proud history of providing safety-critical solutions to the Australian Defence Force, and this partnership with Honeywell will further enhance our capabilities in support of the F-35,\u201d said RFD Australia MD Paul Sedgman.\n\nHoneywell has a longstanding track record of supplying advanced systems to an array of fighter jets. Each F-35 contains more than 100 unique Honeywell parts, including avionics systems, inertial navigation systems, engine fuel controls, wheels and brakes and the power and thermal management system.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s power and thermal management system combines all the functions of an auxiliary power unit, emergency power unit, environmental control system and thermal management system in one highly integrated package. The power and thermal management system from Honeywell is the only system of its kind in operation, with its operational performance and maturity proven throughout the more than one million flight hours of over 1,080 F-35 aircraft delivered to date.",

            "content": "Brent Honeywell made his debut with the Dodgers on July 14, when he pitched three scoreless innings to open the game against the Tigers. (Carlos Osorio / Associated Press)\n\nJarren Duran looked back at the mitt of Dodgers catcher Will Smith, where a funky 82-mph pitch from right-hander Brent Honeywell had just landed after breaking down and away from the left-handed-hitting slugger.\n\nThen the Boston Red Sox star shot a glance at home-plate umpire Laz Diaz, who rang up Duran on a called third strike that was outside of the zone to end the top of the ninth inning of an eventual 7-6, 11-inning Dodgers victory on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re fooling the umpires,\u201d Dodgers reliever Alex Vesia said, \u201cthat\u2019s a pretty good pitch.\u201d\n\nThe pitch in question was a screwball, once known as a \u201creverse curveball,\u201d a pitch that Fernando Valenzuela made famous in 1981, when the Dodgers left-hander went 13-7 with a 2.48 ERA and eight shutouts to win the National League Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards.\n\nRead more:Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez caps milestone day with heroic effort in thrilling Dodgers win\n\nIt was also a pitch that Mike Marshall used heavily in 1974, when the Dodgers right-hander went 15-12 with a 2.42 ERA and 21 saves and threw 208\u2153 innings in a major league-record 106 relief appearances to win the NL Cy Young Award.\n\nThe screwball is so rare that Honeywell is believed to be the only current major leaguer throwing the pitch, which left-hander Hector Santiago threw for five teams, including the Angels, from 2011-2019.\n\nAnd in another statistical oddity, a through line can be drawn almost directly from Marshall five decades ago to Honeywell, who was claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13 and has allowed only three hits in seven scoreless innings of his first three appearances with the Dodgers.\n\nMarshall, who died at the age of 78 in 2021, and Honeywell\u2019s father, Brent Sr., were cousins. Marshall, who played 14 years (1967-81) in the big leagues, was the head coach at Saint Leo University, a Division II school in the Tampa Bay area, from 1984-88. Brent Honeywell Sr. pitched for Saint Leo from 1985-88.\n\n\u201cMike Marshall taught my dad the pitch, and then my dad taught me the pitch when I was in high school,\u201d Honeywell said. \u201cI\u2019ve been throwing it my whole career.\u201d\n\nThe movement of the screwball, which breaks toward the arm side of a pitcher, is caused by an unorthodox motion that requires a pitcher to pronate his hand and forearm, the snapping of his wrist causing his palm to face away from his glove side.\n\nMany coaches believe the pitch puts too much stress on the arm, a notion Honeywell disputes even though he underwent four elbow surgeries, including a Tommy John procedure, that sidelined him for 3\u00bd seasons from 2017-2021.\n\n\u201cI think any pitches are taxing, so that's a full-blown myth,\u201d Honeywell, 29, said. \u201cIt's easy to say because no one else throws it, but it\u2019s just like driving a car that's faster than others. As soon as something goes wrong with it, it's like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s too fast,\u2019 and no one knows how to fix it.\u201d\n\nRead more:Former Dodgers star reliever Mike Marshall dies at 78\n\nThere is nothing fast about Honeywell\u2019s screwball, which averages 80.8 mph and, according to Baseball Savant, features an average drop of 44.4 inches and an average left-to-right break of 8.1 inches.\n\nIt is one of three secondary pitches, including an 85.6-mph slider and an 82.1-mph sweeper, that Honeywell uses to offset a four-seam fastball that averages 94.7 mph.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to catch hitters off-guard,\u201d said Honeywell, who was a second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Rays in 2014 and didn\u2019t make his big-league debut until 2021. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one pitch in a pretty wide repertoire.\u201d\n\nHoneywell came up through the Rays\u2019 farm system as a starter, and he showed in his first game with the Dodgers, when he threw 36 pitches over three scoreless innings in a 4-3 loss at Detroit on July 14, he can provide multiple innings.\n\n\u201cThat night he pitched in Detroit was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him,\u201d said Rick Honeycutt, 70, the former Dodgers pitching coach who transitioned to a special assistant role in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got my old number (40), and I didn\u2019t see the last four letters of his name on his jersey when he was pitching. I actually texted Orel [Hershiser, Dodgers broadcaster] and said we\u2019ve got another \u2018Honey\u2019 wearing No. 40.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHoneycutt, who spent five years (1983-87) of his 21-year career with the Dodgers, joined the team on this homestand and saw Honeywell blank the Red Sox on one hit in the eighth and ninth innings on Saturday and blank the San Francisco Giants on one hit in the sixth and seventh innings of Tuesday night\u2019s 5-2 win.\n\nHoneywell used an 80-mph screwball to induce an inning-ending double-play grounder from Rob Refsnyder to end his outing against the Red Sox.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that pitch a lot, but when you see the success Fernando had with it, and that was Marshall\u2019s No. 1 go-to pitch \u2014 he was a bull out there \u2014 you\u2019d think more people would have continued to throw it,\u201d Honeycutt said.\n\nDoes Honeycutt, who has spent more than five decades in the game, think the screwball is too taxing on the arm?\n\nRead more:Dodgers again fail to hold lead in ninth, dropping series to Tigers\n\n\u201cI couldn't give you a good estimation about that because Fernando obviously pitched a long time with it, and Mike Marshall was able to do it,\u201d Honeycutt said. \u201cYou could probably learn it, but you would have to have somebody who was somewhat of an expert at it to teach you.\u201d\n\nFor Honeywell, that expert was his father, who pitched for three seasons (1988-90) in the Pirates organization but never rose above the Class-A level.\n\nAnd for the elder Honeywell, that expert was Marshall, who went 97-112 with a 3.14 ERA during his 14-year career and went on to work as an independent pitching coach and consultant, teaching theories of kinesiology, mechanics and training techniques that many in baseball deemed too unorthodox for mainstream use.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty good at his job, and I think he was pretty good about everything else around baseball,\u201d Honeywell said. \u201cWhether he was liked or not, he moved the game forward, and that\u2019s all he wanted to do. He didn\u2019t have any skin in the game, other than wanting the game to be better.\u201d\n\nSign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAfter all, the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is in a correction -- which is a drawdown of at least 10% from a recent high. Tech-focused Dow stocks -- like Nvidia, Amazon, and Salesforce -- have been selling off, too.\n\nRead on to learn why changes to the Dow help the index better represent the U.S. stock market. I'll also discuss how to view the Dow, compared to the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow's major makeover\n\nAdding tech-focused companies has altered the composition of the Dow. But so has the outperformance of the financial sector.\n\nThe Dow is a price-weighted index -- meaning that stock prices, rather than market caps, impact the weightings. The stock prices of many financial stocks have gone up as the financial sector was one of the top-performing areas in 2024. But none of these companies have issued stock splits in recent years, giving financials a higher weighting the Dow.\n\nAt over $560 a share, Goldman Sachs is currently the highest-weighted Dow component. Visa is the seventh-highest weighted, American Express is 15th, Travelers Companies is 12th, and JPMorgan Chase is 14th. Combined, these five financial companies make up 23.9% of the index, which is higher than the combined weighting of Microsoft, Salesforce, International Business Machines, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Cisco Systems, which make up 22.2%.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia underwent stock splits before being added to the index. Although Nvidia and Amazon are two of the most valuable companies in the world, they both hold below-average weightings in the Dow.\n\nStill, there's no denying that the Dow is more growth-focused than in years past. The strong performance of financial stocks has stretched their valuations, so the Dow isn't as value-focused, either.\n\nThe Dow's growth focus could make it more volatile\n\nDuring a growth-fueled stock market sell-off, investors would typically expect the Dow to hold up a lot better than the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite. This is because during market sell-offs, investors are more likely to scrutinize valuations and pay less for potential earnings growth, especially if an economic downturn may delay that growth.\n\nFor example, in 2020, the Dow fell less than 10%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite had far worse sell-offs, as you can see below.\n\nHowever, so far this year, the Dow is down, even though sectors typically associated with the Dow (like healthcare, financials, consumer staples, and industrials) are all up in 2025.\n\nThe Dow and the broader economy\n\nWhen scanning the stock market, it's easy to get bogged down by sector labels or classifying a stock as growth, income, or value. The same can happen with indexes. In the past, the Nasdaq was typically seen as the tech-focused growth index, the S&P 500 was the balanced index representing large-cap companies across all sectors, and the Dow was all about value and income.\n\nThat mentality made more sense when the largest U.S.-based companies by market cap were names like General Electric and ExxonMobil. But today, 9 out of the 10 largest U.S.-based companies by market cap are tech-focused. The only one that isn't is Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nTechnology has become a bigger part of the U.S. economy, so it makes sense that the S&P 500 and Dow are becoming more tech-focused. Apple is arguably a modern-day consumer staple company since smartphones are integral to everyday life. Similarly, advertisers are spending more and more on Alphabet's Google search and YouTube or Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, which have taken market share from more traditional outlets.\n\nIn many ways, changes to the Dow merely reflect how the economy is evolving. Nvidia is worth nearly 30 times more than Intel, which is why it's a better fit to represent the semiconductor industry. Amazon represents e-commerce in a way that a brick-and-mortar retailer could not.\n\nIn sum, it's a good idea to continue modernizing the Dow. However, investors need to be aware of index changes so they don't assume the Dow is immune from a growth-stock-led sell-off in the broader market.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "For investors in Nigeria\u2019s consumer goods sector, Honeywell Flour Mills (HONYFLOUR) has been the standout performer over the past 15 months; currently, the best-performing consumer goods sector and the fourth best on the NGX.\n\nIn 2024, Honeywell Flour Mills\u2019s share price jumped by 95%, significantly outperforming the consumer goods sector index, which rose by 54.44% over the same period.\n\nThe strong momentum has continued into 2025, with the stock gaining another 95% so far this year, reaching a 52-week high of N14 on February 14 before pulling back slightly.\n\nThe broader sector has also improved, with 14 gainers, two unchanged stocks, and four decliners as of the close of trading on March 18, 2025; an improvement from 2024\u2019s nine gainers, four unchanged, and seven decliners.\n\nFor investors, this 95% gain means that an initial investment at the start of the year would have nearly doubled in value.\n\nFor instance, a N1 million investment in HONYFLOUR would now be worth N1.95 million.\n\nWhy is HONYFLOUR surging?\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills\u2019 stock rally appears to be underpinned by its financial turnaround. After recording pre-tax losses of N9.54 billion in the 2023 financial year and N8.60 billion in the 2024 financial year, the company has returned to profitability.\n\nIn the first nine months of the 2025 financial year, which ends in March 2025, it reported a pre-tax profit of N12.28 billion a sharp reversal from the N8.83 billion loss in the same period the prior year\n\nWhat changed? A steep drop in net finance costs. In the 2024 financial year (ended March 31, 2024), FX losses of N25 billion and interest expenses of N11 billion wiped out operating profits, resulting in another loss.\n\nHowever, in the first nine months of the 2025 financial year, FX losses narrowed to N8.56 billion, while interest expenses declined further. This allowed N27 billion in operating profit to flow through to the bottom line, marking a significant turnaround.\n\nRevenue growth has also been a catalyst. Sales surged 123% YoY to N277.06 billion in the first nine months of the 2025 financial year, already 47% higher than full-year 2024 revenue of N188 billion, driven more by Apapa manufacturing activities.\n\nThe Apapa segment manufactures Flour, Semo and Wheat meal, while Sagamu segment manufactures Noodles and Pasta respectively.\n\nAreas of concern\n\nDespite the financial recovery, investors should be mindful of risks, especially the stock\u2019s low free float.\n\nOut of 7.93 billion total shares, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc (through its subsidiaries) controls 85.54% (6.87 billion shares). This leaves only 1.15 billion shares available for public trading.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nWith fewer shares available for trading, even small buy orders can push prices higher, increasing volatility.\n\nThe stock\u2019s low beta of 0.4130 suggests it does not move in sync with the broader market, which aligns with the fact the share price rally could be influenced by other factors like the relatively free float.\n\nAdditionally, entry and exit could be challenging, particularly for investors trading in large volumes.\n\nWhat should investors do?\n\nFor existing shareholders, holding makes sense given the company\u2019s turnaround and strong price momentum.\n\nFor new investors, buying at current levels carries risk, as the stock\u2019s rally appears driven more by supply constraints than pure fundamentals.\n\nMinority shareholders, in particular, should be mindful of their position. With Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc controlling 85.54% of the company, decision-making power is highly concentrated. This means strategic moves, such as a potential buyout or delisting, could happen with limited influence from minority investors.\n\nOverall, if the stock price remains elevated without matching earnings growth, locking in some profits (partial sell) could be a smart move. However, if the company sustains its recovery, holding long-term may still offer value.\n\nGiven Nigeria\u2019s dynamic market, momentum can shift quickly. Investors should carefully weigh the opportunities against the risks and remain prepared for sudden changes.",

This partnership aims to enhance inventory tracking and case counting in warehouses and distribution centers (DCs), improving stock visibility while reducing labor costs.\n\nEnhancing Automation in Inventory Management\n\nSwiftDecoder software enables drones to scan barcodes efficiently, even in complex and fast-moving warehouse environments. By combining Honeywell\u2019s scanning technology with Corvus Robotics\u2019 proprietary case-counting artificial intelligence, the system can decode numerous cases at once.\n\nJackie Wu, CEO at Corvus Robotics, emphasized the benefits of this collaboration: \u201cWe selected Honeywell\u2019s SwiftDecoder software for our cutting-edge drones due to the company\u2019s long-standing expertise in the warehousing sector and the software\u2019s ability to efficiently and reliably acquire data, even in complex and fast-moving DC environments.\u201d He further noted that integrating Honeywell\u2019s software with Corvus Robotics\u2019 technology enables warehouses to manage inventory more effectively, reduce operational costs, and improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nAutonomous Drones for Real-Time Inventory Audits\n\nThe Corvus One\u2122 Autonomous Inventory Management System, powered by SwiftDecoder software, is designed to navigate through DCs and conduct inventory audits faster than human workers. Traditional inventory counting can be challenging in large warehouse spaces, especially when dealing with high shelves, difficult-to-reach racks, and low-light conditions.\n\nUnlike conventional scanning methods, Corvus One drones use computer vision to navigate, scan, map, and count inventory without relying on GPS, Wi-Fi, wireless beacons, or human operators. By providing real-time insights, this system allows warehouses to allocate their limited workforce to other high-value tasks.\n\nDavid Barker, president of Honeywell Productivity Solutions and Services, highlighted the importance of automation in addressing labor shortages: \u201cAs the labor shortage continues to plague the supply chain, we know that companies are looking for solutions to supplement their human workforce. By automating inventory counting and providing real-time data, the Honeywell-Corvus Robotics solution will help retailers keep up with growing demand and complexity, reduce inventory discrepancies and errors, and improve overall supply chain performance.\u201d\n\nFaster and More Accurate Barcode Scanning\n\nSwiftDecoder software is capable of batch scanning, which allows drones to capture multiple barcodes simultaneously. This technology enhances the Corvus One system\u2019s ability to count individual cartons in a single location, providing warehouse operators with instant stock level data.\n\nThe ability to gather and process inventory data in real time helps businesses make informed decisions quickly. This capability allows companies to react to supply chain disruptions, maintain operational continuity, and optimize inventory levels to meet changing demands.\n\nFor more information about Honeywell\u2019s supply chain automation solutions, visit Honeywell\u2019s website.\n\nWant DRONELIFE news delivered to your inbox every weekday?

The company today trades at 24 times earnings, about the same valuation as 2020 and 30% below the company's multiple in 2021. The stock has been largely flat during that time.\n\nManagement is aware of the disconnect, and has big plans to address it.\n\nWhat's wrong at Honeywell?\n\nHoneywell is a conglomerate focused on manufacturing highly engineered components for high-growth industrial end markets. But the business has been stuck in neutral. In February, Honeywell guided for first-quarter and full-year earnings significantly below Wall Street expectations.\n\nCritics, including activist Elliott Management, have concluded Honeywell suffers from a so-called \"conglomerate discount.\" The fear is that with Honeywell's different businesses obscured under one holding company, investors don't appreciate the strengths of each individual unit. That, in turn, causes the market to undervalue the stock.\n\nHoneywell's plan to fix its flailing stock price\n\nIn February, Honeywell said it would split into three independent companies focused on advanced materials, automation, and aerospace.\n\nAs independents, the hope is the units will not have to compete for capital and other resources. And each business will be free to pursue mergers and pay dividends based on the norms of their industries.\n\n\"The distinct investment profile of each company and an improved ability to customize capital allocation strategy will unleash the full potential of each company's strong balance sheet, creating the best path forward for an enhanced commercial success, faster-paced technological innovation, and increased customer intimacy,\" CEO Vimal M. Kapur told investors.\n\nIt's worth noting that Honeywell has tried this before, with uninspiring results. The 2018 spinoffs of Resideo Technologies and Garrett Motion have underperformed, along with Honeywell.\n\nThere's a key difference between then and now: Back in 2018, Honeywell shed underperforming units to focus on growth-focused businesses. If the planned breakup clears the fog around Honeywell and allows investors to focus on the strength of the individual businesses, today's buyers could be rewarded in the years to come.",

            "content": "Investors are usually happy when a company can pull off one big goal and do it well. So Wall Street was almost certainly expecting Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) to focus all of its attention in the immediate future on what amounts to a massive corporate restructuring. Then management threw a wrench into the works by announcing plans for a $2.16 billion acquisition. What is going on?\n\nHoneywell is feeling the zeitgeist\n\nWall Street tends to go through periods when companies buying up other companies to create ever-bigger conglomerates is seen as the natural path to success. Then, the script flips and investors start pushing for massive companies to spin units off and \"unlock value,\" under the theory that the various business units would perform better as focused, standalone entities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nRight now, it seems like there's a general desire among investors for companies to break themselves apart. The biggest recent story in this vein was probably General Electric, which is General Electric no longer. It is now GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE), GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), and GE Healthcare (NASDAQ: GEHC).\n\nBut that industrial giant was not the only iconic company to slim down recently. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), for example, spun off its consumer healthcare business as Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE), leaving the parent company able to focus all of its attention on its drug and medical device businesses.\n\nHoneywell, a diversified industrial conglomerate, started down this same path by announcing plans to spin off its advanced materials business into a standalone entity. Then it went a step further when it announced, just before releasing its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings last month, that it was actually going to break up into three businesses: advanced materials, Honeywell Automation, and Honeywell Aerospace.\n\nIt is complicated to spin off one business unit. It is even more complicated to break a massive public company up into three new ones. General Electric's path to do the same thing was a multiyear affair. Often companies in the middle of transformative actions like this end up in something of a stasis mode on other fronts, given all of the work that goes into managing a breakup. Any thoughts of acquisitions usually get put on the back burner since they are kind of antithetical to the idea of breaking up and slimming down.\n\nHoneywell isn't giving up on growth through acquisitions\n\nHoneywell is not content to do things the easy way and simply go from point A (conglomerate) to point B (three smaller companies). It has announced that it will buy Sundyne from a private equity firm for $2.16 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. Sundyne makes and provides aftermarket support for highly engineered pumps and gas compressors.\n\nWhile the acquisition should be a good fit for Honeywell, the most important aspect of the deal is probably management's statement that it's doing this deal while still moving forward full speed on its break up and other streamlining efforts. As for the other streamlining efforts, Honeywell is expected to complete the sale of its personal protective equipment business in the first half of 2025. The conglomerate has a lot on its plate.\n\nThere's good news and bad news here. Unlike GE, which was essentially forced to break up because of the weakened condition of its business following the Great Recession, Honeywell is breaking up while it is in a position of strength. Its sales rose 5% in 2024, and adjusted earnings grew by 4% -- not massive growth, but a pretty solid performance for a $130 billion market cap company. Further, its fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings exceeded its guidance, so the year ended on a particularly strong note. While the planned breakup is big news, management clearly isn't easing back on the accelerator.\n\nThe bad news is that management's plan to keep operating in some ways as if Honeywell wasn't splitting apart increases uncertainty. It is purposefully making a complex situation even more complex. If it can execute everything well, that won't be a problem, but the risk of missteps increases with every additional corporate transaction.\n\nHoneywell is a special situations stock right now\n\nIf all Honeywell was doing was selling off some of its smaller units while simultaneously making bolt-on acquisitions to bolster the core company, there would be no problems. But its actual strategy has made it something of a special situations stock. There's probably no reason to sell Honeywell shares now if you already own them (unless you hate the idea of this breakup, of course), but buying the stock today is probably something that only more aggressive investors should do, given the number of balls management is juggling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Honeywell International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Honeywell International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Honeywell International wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "In a significant move towards supporting retailers and supermarket owners, Honeywell has announced the commercial availability of its A2L refrigerants for the North American market. These innovative refrigerants are compatible with new equipment from Heatcraft Refrigeration Products and can help customers improve efficiency, reduce operating expenses, and comply with evolving environmental regulations.\n\nHeatcraft is the first commercial refrigeration manufacturer in North America to offer equipment that uses A2L refrigerants, which includes Honeywell Solstice\u00ae L40X (R-455A). A2L is a safety classification for hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) refrigerants that indicates low toxicity and low flammability. These new A2L refrigerants provide a safe and efficient option for retailers, supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and refrigerated transport companies that rely on refrigerants to keep their food and products fresh.\n\n\u201cOffering equipment that is compatible with A2L refrigerants is crucial for retailers in North America as new government regulations take effect and commonly used high global warming potential refrigerants are phased out,\u201d said David Bola\u00f1os, director of marketing and product management at Heatcraft. \u201cWe recognized the need for this equipment years ago and worked closely to develop a solution that benefits our wholesaler customers, as well as contractors and end-users.\u201d\n\nHoneywell and Heatcraft have worked together since 2023 to optimize the low-global warming potential (GWP) solution for Heatcraft\u2019s condensing units and evaporators for walk-in coolers and freezers.\n\nRefrigeration typically represents a significant portion of retailers\u2019 overall energy consumption, so many are looking to move away from high-GWP HFC refrigerants like R-404A and R-507 and adopt more efficient alternatives. Honeywell's A2L/HFO refrigerants, including Solstice\u00ae L40X (R-455A), Solstice\u00ae R-454A, and Solstice\u00ae R-454C provide cost-saving benefits by reducing energy consumption and maintenance requirements. Research from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory also shows that HFO solutions offer greater energy efficiency when compared to CO 2 and propane/hydrocarbon options.\n\nThe innovations from Honeywell in refrigeration have been supported by more than 10 years of research and development into the Solstice product line, which includes A2L refrigerants. Exact cost-saving benefits can vary, but some stores have seen lifetime cost savings that exceed $260,000.1\n\nHoneywell has led the way in developing HFO technologies and is a prominent player in the creation and supply of low-GWP refrigerants, along with other products like blowing agents for thermal insulation and solvents for cleaning solutions. Honeywell also offers A2L training programs, workshops and technical support for HVACR technicians to ensure a smooth transition to new refrigeration solutions.\n\nLearn more about Honeywell Solstice\u00ae A2L Refrigerants.\n\n1The MD Discount Store in San Giovanni, Persiceto, Italy, Honeywell Solstice L40X is projected to support a lifetime cost savings of approximately \u20ac260,000. Results are based on data input from MD and specific analyses using Honeywell\u2019s Eco-Efficiency model, which has been independently validated by Cemafroid.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\n3M named Torsten Pilz, SVP and chief supply chain officer at Honeywell, to lead its supply chain, CEO Bill Brown said during a Feb. 26 investor day conference.\n\nPilz is slated to start his new role in the next couple of months, the CEO said.\n\nHe will succeed 3M Group President of Enterprise Supply Chain Peter Gibbons, who will retire from his role April 2, according to an 8-K form filed Feb. 18. Gibbons has been with the company since 2021, and Brown credited him with being \u201cinstrumental in building this combined, unified end-to-end supply chain organization.\u201d\n\nAs head of 3M\u2019s enterprise supply chain, Gibbons oversaw planning, internal and external manufacturing, procurement, logistics, engineering and quality.\n\nPilz currently holds a similar role at Honeywell, according to Brown, and has also served as VP of supply chain at SpaceX and VP of worldwide operations at Amazon.\n\nA supply chain priority for 3M lately has been to get its delivery service levels \"to where they need to be,\u201d Brown told analysts during a Q4 earnings call in January. In October 2024, Brown said the company's on-time in-full rate improved to 89% as it tackled supply chain inefficiencies. The company was targeting a goal of above 90%.\n\n\u201cWe're definitely losing business for sure, there. We are not delivering. When somebody needs something right now and we don't have it available, that is causing them to go someplace else, even though we have a better brand, sometimes a better product, and attractive price,\u201d Brown told analysts during the recent call.\n\nThe manufacturer\u2019s performance in Safety & Industrial, for instance, remains well below expectations with an OTIF rate in the low 80s. Brown emphasized the need for a \u201cfundamental shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're doing this by standardizing the demand planning process, using new algorithms to improve forecast accuracy, improving supplier delivery performance, and driving consistency and reliability in logistics,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nDuring the investors conference, Gibbons outlined the framework to link supply and demand across 3M\u2019s entire supply chain to deliver improved service and inventory, moving up from a high 80s on-time in-full rate, to above 90% OTIF rate. To achieve this, 3M will build out its capabilities, technical skills, as well as adding tools and technologies to its \u201ctoolkit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's clear there are fantastic opportunities to rewire our supply chain, product platforming, delving into tier two, tier three suppliers, looking at AI-powered planning and quality systems, all kinds of fabulous things we can do,\u201d Gibbons told analysts.",

Justice Aneke cited Section 396(2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, affirming that the accused must first take their plea before challenging the charges.\n\nThe EFCC's charge sheet details a staggering N12.3billion fraud allegedly executed through tranches of N5.2billion, N6.2billion, N6.1 billion, N1.5billion, and N500million.\n\nThe agency further alleges that the defendants forged documents to mislead a financial institution.\n\nThe alleged offences violate Sections 8(a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006, and Sections 15(2), 15(3), and 18(c) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011.\n\n\u201cIt is now a settled principle of law that the plea of a defendant must first be taken before any other application,\u201d the court ruled.\n\nIt continued: \u201cThe issue before the court is whether the processes before the court can be taken before the arraignment of the defendants.\n\n\u201cAny preliminary objection to the validity of a charge can only be heard after plea is taken; this is now a condition precedent and this court is bound by the decision.\n\n\u201cI agree with learned counsel for the prosecution, no preliminary objection can be taken without arraignment of the defendants,\u201d the judge held.\n\nIn the charge marked FHC/L/20C/2025,the EFCC alleged that the defendants fraudulently obtained N12.3bn in tranches of N5.2bn, N6.2bn, N6.1bn, N1.5bn and N500m, between 2013 and 2014 in Lagos,\n\nThe anti-graft agency further alleged that the defendants made and uttered forged documents to deceive the bank.\n\nThe prosecution said they acted contrary to the provisions of Section 8(a) of Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and Section 15 (2), 15(3), and 18(c) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011.",

            "content": "Brent Honeywell made his debut with the Dodgers on July 14, when he pitched three scoreless innings to open the game against the Tigers. (Carlos Osorio / Associated Press)\n\nJarren Duran looked back at the mitt of Dodgers catcher Will Smith, where a funky 82-mph pitch from right-hander Brent Honeywell had just landed after breaking down and away from the left-handed-hitting slugger.\n\nThen the Boston Red Sox star shot a glance at home-plate umpire Laz Diaz, who rang up Duran on a called third strike that was outside of the zone to end the top of the ninth inning of an eventual 7-6, 11-inning Dodgers victory on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re fooling the umpires,\u201d Dodgers reliever Alex Vesia said, \u201cthat\u2019s a pretty good pitch.\u201d\n\nThe pitch in question was a screwball, once known as a \u201creverse curveball,\u201d a pitch that Fernando Valenzuela made famous in 1981, when the Dodgers left-hander went 13-7 with a 2.48 ERA and eight shutouts to win the National League Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards.\n\nRead more:Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez caps milestone day with heroic effort in thrilling Dodgers win\n\nIt was also a pitch that Mike Marshall used heavily in 1974, when the Dodgers right-hander went 15-12 with a 2.42 ERA and 21 saves and threw 208\u2153 innings in a major league-record 106 relief appearances to win the NL Cy Young Award.\n\nThe screwball is so rare that Honeywell is believed to be the only current major leaguer throwing the pitch, which left-hander Hector Santiago threw for five teams, including the Angels, from 2011-2019.\n\nAnd in another statistical oddity, a through line can be drawn almost directly from Marshall five decades ago to Honeywell, who was claimed off waivers from the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13 and has allowed only three hits in seven scoreless innings of his first three appearances with the Dodgers.\n\nMarshall, who died at the age of 78 in 2021, and Honeywell\u2019s father, Brent Sr., were cousins. Marshall, who played 14 years (1967-81) in the big leagues, was the head coach at Saint Leo University, a Division II school in the Tampa Bay area, from 1984-88. Brent Honeywell Sr. pitched for Saint Leo from 1985-88.\n\n\u201cMike Marshall taught my dad the pitch, and then my dad taught me the pitch when I was in high school,\u201d Honeywell said. \u201cI\u2019ve been throwing it my whole career.\u201d\n\nThe movement of the screwball, which breaks toward the arm side of a pitcher, is caused by an unorthodox motion that requires a pitcher to pronate his hand and forearm, the snapping of his wrist causing his palm to face away from his glove side.\n\nMany coaches believe the pitch puts too much stress on the arm, a notion Honeywell disputes even though he underwent four elbow surgeries, including a Tommy John procedure, that sidelined him for 3\u00bd seasons from 2017-2021.\n\n\u201cI think any pitches are taxing, so that's a full-blown myth,\u201d Honeywell, 29, said. \u201cIt's easy to say because no one else throws it, but it\u2019s just like driving a car that's faster than others. As soon as something goes wrong with it, it's like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s too fast,\u2019 and no one knows how to fix it.\u201d\n\nRead more:Former Dodgers star reliever Mike Marshall dies at 78\n\nThere is nothing fast about Honeywell\u2019s screwball, which averages 80.8 mph and, according to Baseball Savant, features an average drop of 44.4 inches and an average left-to-right break of 8.1 inches.\n\nIt is one of three secondary pitches, including an 85.6-mph slider and an 82.1-mph sweeper, that Honeywell uses to offset a four-seam fastball that averages 94.7 mph.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to catch hitters off-guard,\u201d said Honeywell, who was a second-round pick of the Tampa Bay Rays in 2014 and didn\u2019t make his big-league debut until 2021. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one pitch in a pretty wide repertoire.\u201d\n\nHoneywell came up through the Rays\u2019 farm system as a starter, and he showed in his first game with the Dodgers, when he threw 36 pitches over three scoreless innings in a 4-3 loss at Detroit on July 14, he can provide multiple innings.\n\n\u201cThat night he pitched in Detroit was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen him,\u201d said Rick Honeycutt, 70, the former Dodgers pitching coach who transitioned to a special assistant role in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got my old number (40), and I didn\u2019t see the last four letters of his name on his jersey when he was pitching. I actually texted Orel [Hershiser, Dodgers broadcaster] and said we\u2019ve got another \u2018Honey\u2019 wearing No. 40.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHoneycutt, who spent five years (1983-87) of his 21-year career with the Dodgers, joined the team on this homestand and saw Honeywell blank the Red Sox on one hit in the eighth and ninth innings on Saturday and blank the San Francisco Giants on one hit in the sixth and seventh innings of Tuesday night\u2019s 5-2 win.\n\nHoneywell used an 80-mph screwball to induce an inning-ending double-play grounder from Rob Refsnyder to end his outing against the Red Sox.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see that pitch a lot, but when you see the success Fernando had with it, and that was Marshall\u2019s No. 1 go-to pitch \u2014 he was a bull out there \u2014 you\u2019d think more people would have continued to throw it,\u201d Honeycutt said.\n\nDoes Honeycutt, who has spent more than five decades in the game, think the screwball is too taxing on the arm?\n\nRead more:Dodgers again fail to hold lead in ninth, dropping series to Tigers\n\n\u201cI couldn't give you a good estimation about that because Fernando obviously pitched a long time with it, and Mike Marshall was able to do it,\u201d Honeycutt said. \u201cYou could probably learn it, but you would have to have somebody who was somewhat of an expert at it to teach you.\u201d\n\nFor Honeywell, that expert was his father, who pitched for three seasons (1988-90) in the Pirates organization but never rose above the Class-A level.\n\nAnd for the elder Honeywell, that expert was Marshall, who went 97-112 with a 3.14 ERA during his 14-year career and went on to work as an independent pitching coach and consultant, teaching theories of kinesiology, mechanics and training techniques that many in baseball deemed too unorthodox for mainstream use.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty good at his job, and I think he was pretty good about everything else around baseball,\u201d Honeywell said. \u201cWhether he was liked or not, he moved the game forward, and that\u2019s all he wanted to do. He didn\u2019t have any skin in the game, other than wanting the game to be better.\u201d\n\nSign up for more Dodgers news with Dodgers Dugout.

This acquisition follows Honeywell\u2019s recent announcements about the planned separation of its Aerospace Technologies business and spin-off of Advanced Materials.\n\nThese efforts are part of Honeywell\u2019s broader strategy to simplify its portfolio and drive organic growth, including a series of strategic acquisitions worth approximately $9 billion since December 2023. Honeywell anticipates the Sundyne acquisition to close by the second quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nHoneywell is a global technology company focused on automation, aviation, and energy transition, helping organizations solve complex challenges with innovative solutions.

This solution will be used within warehouses and distribution centres to make the process of tracking rapidly changing inventory quicker and more accurate for retailers, distributors and manufacturers at the case- and pallet-level.\n\nThe Corvus One Autonomous Inventory Management System, equipped with SwiftDecoder software, is able to fly through distribution centres to conduct inventory audits. It can accomplish this task more quickly than a human could in vast warehouse spaces that often have very high shelves, hard-to-reach racks or products and low-light conditions that can make traditional scanning a challenge.\n\nBy using computer vision to navigate, scan, map and count inventory in real time, the drones are able to operate without GPS, human operators, Wi-Fi or wireless beacons. This system not only helps warehouses get an accurate picture of inventory, but also enables companies to deploy limited labor resources in other ways that add greater value to the business.\n\n\u201cAs the labour shortage continues to plague the supply chain, we know that companies are looking for solutions to supplement their human workforce,\u201d said David Barker, president of Honeywell Productivity Solutions and Services. \u201cBy automating inventory counting and providing real-time data, the Honeywell-Corvus Robotics solution will help retailers keep up with growing demand and complexity, reduce inventory discrepancies and errors and improve overall supply chain performance.\u201d\n\nHoneywell\u2019s SwiftDecoder software can batch scan to capture many barcodes at the same time. This capability, coupled with Corvus One\u2019s onboard sensors and cameras, allows the inventory management system to count the number of individual cartons in a single location.\n\nThe real-time data that is captured and processed with the solution allows for immediate insights into stock levels and case counts, helping businesses make informed decisions quickly, respond proactively to any supply chain disruptions and maintain operational continuity.\n\n\u201cWith Honeywell\u2019s software and our in-house proprietary case counting AI technology, we can quickly decode many cases in one location, all at once. Together, Corvus Robotics and Honeywell are empowering warehouses and distribution centres to better manage inventory, reduce operational expenses and streamline the overall flow of goods throughout the supply chain,\u201d said Jackie Wu, CEO at Corvus Robotics.",

She leaves behind her children, Sharon, Tom (Judi), Rick (Judy), Nancy (Steve) MacDonald and Mike (Tonia); along with her grandchildren, Denise, Rachelle, Kevin, Matt, Tom, Niki and Neil and their families including their spouses; and 17 great and great-great grandchildren who will all miss her deeply. She will be greeted in death by her husband, Eddie; and grandsons, Nathan and Keith. Shirley was born in South Minneapolis on November 12, 1928 and was one of seven children born to Selma and Arthur Johnson. Shirley was preceded in death by all of her siblings. She is survived by many nieces and nephews and one remaining brother-in-law, Howie Schmitt. Shirley had fun as a teenager working as a \"soda jerk\" at a drugstore on Lake & Lyndale. Shirley was also proud of her full- time job at the Honeywell Stinson plant where she was in charge of payroll and other office duties. She met her husband, Edward (Eddie), at a dance at Marigold Ballroom in Minneapolis, and they were married on June 8, 1948. After their second child was born, she became a full-time homemaker and mother to their 5 children and supported her husband's business running Eddie's Transmission and Service Center. They spent most summer and fall weekends at the family cabin in northern Minnesota. Family was the center of her life. Shirley created a beautiful and loving home, and she made everyone feel special with her smile, humor and positivity. Shirley enjoyed socializing with her family and neighbors, spending time with her grandkids, and music and dancing. She was a hard worker, devoted wife, loving mother, excellent cook, pristine gardener and was always game for fun! She always looked on the bright side but was also very astute and never let anyone pull the wool over her eyes. Eddie passed away in 2002 and, in later years, Shirley lived with her daughter Sharon and enjoyed playing cards, going to restaurants and the casino, and time with family who will carry memories of the good times with her in their hearts. Memorial service will be held on Tuesday, March 25, at 1 pm at KOZLAK RADULOVICH BLAINE CHAPEL (1385 107th Ave, Blaine) with visitation starting at noon and time to socialize after the service.

As reported by Bloomberg, the acquisition could be financed through the duo's emerging private credit partnership. This initiative is expected to generate around $7 billion for Boeing, with debt financing potentially ranging between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, according to sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe financing proposal underscores a competitive landscape where both corporate and private equity buyers, including entities like RTX Corp. and Honeywell International Inc., are evaluating their options. Simultaneously, private equity firms such as Carlyle Group Inc., Thoma Bravo, and Warburg Pincus have expressed interest in Jeppesen. The offering marks a critical examination of Citigroup and Apollo's collaboration, established to support $25 billion in deals over a five-year horizon.\n\nAs private credit firms vie with traditional banks in the leveraged-finance sector, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. have also intensified their direct lending efforts. The rising demand for acquisition-backed financing illustrates the growing attractiveness of private credit solutions, which offer flexibility and expedited processing compared to conventional syndicated loans.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

The S&P 500 plunged from its February 19 high on the heels of stern tariff talk and phrases like \u201ca little bit of an adjustment period\u201d from President Trump and the economy entering a \u201cdetox period,\u201d as Treasury Secretary Bessent said last week.1\n\nWhile tariffs were certainly a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, the assumption was that his other pro-business policies\u2014loosening regulation, lowering taxes, and filling his cabinet with free-market advocates\u2014would overshadow any negative impacts from import duties.\n\nMoreover, the president going after Mexico, Canada, and Europe so aggressively was not anticipated, as China was generally seen as the primary trade-war \u201cenemy\u201d.\n\nThe political chess game has seemingly never been so intertwined with markets. Investors have come to expect daily updates from the White House on tariff tweaks, while members of Trump\u2019s cabinet make news in TV interviews, ultimately driving price action.\n\nSign up for our FREE newsletter\n\nand receive our best trading ideas and research\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\n2025 Turns Red, Particularly for the Mag 7\n\nComing into this week, stocks had been working lower, led by losses among the Magnificent Seven. Monday\u2019s steep selloff included a VIX spike to almost 30 as Tesla (TSLA) had its worst session since September 2020, at one point falling 56% from its all-time high less than three months ago. NVIDIA (NVDA) was off by more than 30% from its peak, and the other Mag 7 stocks were in drawdowns of 18% or more (sans Apple (AAPL) last Monday night.\n\nIt has the feel of both late 2018 and the first half of 2022 all over again. For some once-high-flying-momentum stocks, you might even draw parallels to February-March 2020 in terms of the speed and magnitude of losses.\n\nInternational Alpha\n\n2025 has underscored the value of going global, though. Low-P/E nations like Germany, Spain, Italy, and France have posted impressive gains year to date. As of Tuesday, the euro (EUR) trades at $1.09 against the greenback (USD), and fiscal expansion is now seen in the Euro Area while the US perhaps undergoes austerity, care of DOGE amongst other factors.\n\nCan AI Get Its Groove Back?\n\nThe macro backdrop is stark. Earnings season is over, key macro data is on tap, and the March Fed meeting comes closer into view. Conference season is also active\u2014we\u2019ll see if some shine returns to the AI trade next week at NVIDIA\u2019s GTC AI event and Game Developer\u2019s Conference (anything to distract investors from tariff chatter).\n\nWho Knows\u2026\n\nWith so much policy uncertainty, maybe the best thing for a CEO to do is just focus on their business and maximizing shareholder value rather than trying to predict tariff policy. In a CNBC interview last week, Brown-Forman CEO, Lawson Whiting, told Carl Quintanilla and Sara Eisen, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know any more than you all know. That\u2019s what\u2019s difficult about this\u2026 Every day it seems like the story changes.\u201d2\n\nGetting Down to Business with Spinoffs\n\nOne way to potentially boost value is by re-jiggering the corporate structure. A spinoff happens when a parent company separates a business unit into a standalone entity, and it commonly involves distributing shares of a new company to existing shareholders. Spins are strategic moves to boost total value, allowing the new firm to focus on its specialization, and hopefully unlock hidden value. The parent company may benefit similarly as it can return to its roots.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen successful spinoffs in recent years. The most prominent being General Electric when it spun out into three businesses: GE Aerospace (GE), GE Healthcare (GEHC), and GE Vernova (GEV).3\n\nGE Aerospace, the parent, has performed very well since the spinoff initiatives began some three years ago, soaring more than 400% from its September 2022 low to its high last month. GEHC steadily rallied from its December 2022 IPO through today, returning better than 40%. The wild child is GE Vernova, an energy-focused firm in the Industrials sector, which had more than doubled in its first 10 months of trading, before dropping from $447 in late January (after China\u2019s DeepSeek AI announcement)4 to $270 earlier this week.\n\nKellanova (K), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Baxter International (BAX), Danaher (DHR), and 3M (MMM) have all completed spins in the last three years. The latest blue chip to try its hand at uncovering shareholder value via this corporation action is Honeywell (HON).\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Plan\n\nLike GE, Honeywell is a conglomerate in the Industrials sector. According to Wall Street Horizon data, the Charlotte-based $139 billion market cap company intends to split into three entities: Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and an already-in-motion spinoff of its Advanced Materials division. It aims to streamline operations and sharpen its focus, increasing shareholder value.\n\nOn February 6, Honeywell announced its intent to separate Automation and Aerospace. The move, according to the firm, enables the creation of three industry-leading companies. Per the press release, Honeywell Automation will be a pure play automation leader with global scale and a vast installed base and Honeywell Aerospace will be a premier technology and systems provider enabling the future of aviation globally. Advanced Materials, previously announced to be spun, will aim to be a leading provider of sustainability-focused specialty chemicals and materials. The separation of Automation and Aerospace is to be completed in the second half of 2026.5\n\nHoneywell hopes for a sweeter time ahead considering that its shares have underperformed in both the Industrials sector and S&P 500 since late 2022. The stock has been about flat since the bull market\u2019s early innings, losing more than 30 percentage points to its sector and the US large cap index.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict how the rest of the year unfolds, but investors should be on the lookout for strategic corporate actions that can work no matter what goes on policy-wise. Spinoffs have shown to be a potentially lucrative tool when used effectively. The focus spinoffs can deliver, and ensuing shareholder returns, could be quite appealing as the macro path turns rockier.\n\nSources:\n\n1 REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IN JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, The White House, March 6, 2025, https://www.whitehouse.gov\n\n2 Brown-Forman Posts Q3 EPS Beat, BlueSky, Carl Quintanilla, March 6, 2025, https://bsky.app\n\n3 GE Board of Directors Approves Spin-Off of GE Vernova; GE Vernova and GE Aerospace to Launch April 2, 2024, https://www.ge.com\n\n4 GE Vernova Inc.

            "content": "Opinion: Honeywell can redefine large-scale LNG projects\n\nKen West, President and CEO of Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) at Honeywell, outlines how the Air Products LNG process technologies acquisition creates a new industry execution model\n\nGlobal energy demand is expected to increase by up to 18% by 2050, according to industry analysts. The world is attempting to meet this growing need with an increasing mix of energy sources \u2013 from renewables to bio-based sources such as sustainable aviation fue, in addition to traditional sources.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming a key energy source for some countries to ensure energy security. Consequently, the global LNG industry is experiencing rapid transformation, and also faces several challenges including project bankability, execution risk, and emissions reduction.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s 2024 acquisition of Air Products\u2019 advanced LNG Process Technology business means we have a solution to overcome many of those challenges. The integration of the two operations since has gone well beyond expanding Honeywell\u2019s capabilities. It represents a fundamental shift in developing and executing LNG projects. By leveraging modularisation, digitalisation, and automation, Honeywell can expedite bringing LNG projects to market and enhance peak asset performance. In the process it can redefine the economics of large-scale LNG projects.\n\nAccelerating the timeline\n\nOne of the main challenges in LNG project development is the cost and complexity of execution. Traditionally, the model involves a web of different suppliers for pretreatment, liquefaction, and automation. This mix can result in extended timelines, increased costs, and uncertainty regarding accountability.\n\nNow Honeywell\u2019s acquisition, combined with our pretreatment solutions, has created a new execution model for the industry. By consolidating expertise and establishing a single point of accountability, we mitigate project and interface risks, increase reliability of outcomes, and expedite the timeline from contract signing to project delivery.\n\nAt Honeywell, we are already witnessing these benefits through:\n\nOptimised design resulting from reduced scope fragmentation\n\nThree to six months of time saved through standardized engineering\n\nMore secure financing, as bankers prefer projects with a clear pathway to execution and reduced risk\n\nToday some customers still prefer a more traditional path, collaborating with various industry partners throughout the process, and Honeywell also supports its customers with this model.\n\nThe digital edge\n\nBy integrating our licensor expertise, advanced automation and digital tools into the process, Honeywell can also provide end-users a comprehensive view of the project. Additionally, the incorporation of digital twins and predictive analytics directly into the LNG value chain enables operators to identify issues faster, predict maintenance needs, and increase output.\n\nFor Honeywell, this approach is anticipated to improve LNG production efficiency by 1% to 2%, which is a substantial gain in a sector where even minor improvements can result in millions of dollars in value.\n\nClearing the air\n\nWhile incorporating LNG as an energy source brings significant benefits in emissions reduction, there is pressure to minimise methane leaks and reduce LNG\u2019s overall carbon footprint.\n\nThrough end-to-end process integration, Honeywell can more effectively implement carbon capture strategies. Additionally, automation-driven leak detection enables operators to monitor and address methane emissions in real time.\n\nTruly a new era\n\nHoneywell\u2019s integration of the LNG process technology business represents a strategic shift that transforms the design, execution, and optimisation of LNG projects. By consolidating key capabilities under one umbrella, we are enhancing the bankability, efficiency, and sustainability of LNG projects.\n\nWith global LNG demand expected to grow by over 50% by 2040 \u2013 according to Shell\u2019s LNG Outlook 2024 \u2013 the need for faster, more efficient, and lower-carbon LNG solutions will only intensify. With its expanded capabilities, Honeywell is at the forefront of this evolution. We are demonstrating, in the process, that energy security and low-carbon energy are not mutually exclusive \u2013 rather, they are two sides of the same coin.",

            "content": "Investors in Honeywell International Inc (Symbol: HON) saw new options become available today, for the May 2nd expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HON options chain for the new May 2nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $205.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $205.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $200.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of HON, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $207.34/share today.\n\nBecause the $205.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.44% return on the cash commitment, or 17.80% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Honeywell International Inc, and highlighting in green where the $205.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of HON stock at the current price level of $207.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $210.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.98% if the stock gets called away at the May 2nd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if HON shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Honeywell International Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing HON's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $210.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.70% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.72% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $207.34) to be 19%.

It\u2019s still very non-robust,\u201d Jim Currier, president and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace Technologies, said March 11 at the JPMorgan 2025 Industrials Conference. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of lack of resiliency in the mechanical supply base. It\u2019s an ongoing issue. It will be an ongoing issue for some time.\u201d\n\nCurrier pointed out that Honeywell Aerospace has for 10 straight quarters increased its output despite the supply-chain snags. The business, which will be spun out as an independent company next year, last year produced organic growth of 11% that was fueled by strong demand for its products from the commercial and defense sectors.\n\nHe added that the situation with various parts makers and other suppliers is improving\u2014albeit because Honeywell is pitching in through \u201cinvestments that we\u2019re making in buying tooling for them and the like.\u201d On top of that, Honeywell is following the playbook of many other manufacturers since the COVID-19 pandemic and broadening the base of companies from which it buys.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work in terms of dual-sourcing [and] multi-sourcing many of our products to kind of unlock the capacity that exists there,\u201d said Currier, who has led Honeywell Aerospace since the summer of 2023 after being president of Honeywell\u2019s electronic solutions group.\n\nOn the topic of supply chains, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa asked if tariffs the Trump administration has put in place have the potential to raise component costs and dent Honeywell\u2019s margins.

            "content": "In addition to the following models, we have reviewed and dismissed hundreds of purifiers since 2013 based on their specs, features (or lack thereof), livability, and price. Some well-known brands that have never made our cut include Alen, Bissell, IQAir, Rabbit Air, and TruSens, generally based on their elevated up-front and running costs relative to those of our picks.\n\nWe have also removed from this list many since-discontinued models we tested.\n\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 511i Max is a solid purifier for spaces up to about 200 square feet, but it\u2019s no more powerful than the plain 511 and costs considerably more. It\u2019s slightly more energy-efficient, but both models consume so little electricity that the practical difference is almost nil. We think you\u2019re better off spending slightly more on a much more capable purifier, like the Coway Mighty or Winix 5500-2, or a pair of Blue Pure 511 units to protect two separate small rooms.\n\nPuroAir\u2019s 240 and 400 are highly regarded, and deservedly so. They\u2019re competitively priced, and they performed extremely well against particulate pollution in our tests, rivaling (respectively) the Coway Mighty and the large-space Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max. These PuroAir models use H14 filters, which are marginally more efficient at capturing particles than true HEPA/H13 filters, but we consider that to be merely academic: In real-world use (versus controlled lab testing), there\u2019s no practical difference between 99.995% and 99.970%. A handful of livability factors kept these purifiers off our list of picks. Neither model lets you shut off the display except in Sleep mode, when the fan is barely moving and filtration is minimal. And both are available only in black.\n\nThe Windmill Air Purifier performed well in our tests, but you\u2019re paying mostly for its good looks. It\u2019s comparable in performance to the Coway Mighty and our other picks for living-room-sized spaces. It has the display-shutoff feature that we consider invaluable, and it is particularly attractive in the optional bamboo finish. But it costs $300 in the black and white versions, and $400 in bamboo. It also lacks a carry handle, which makes lifting and placing its 21-pound bulk challenging and even precarious.\n\nSans is guilty of some of the most egregious marketing overstatements we\u2019ve ever seen. Its \u201cwhole home\u201d model, with \u201ccoverage up to 1,560 square feet,\u201d has a CADR of just 207 cubic feet per minute, considerably less than our picks. At our recommended 4 air changes per hour, it would max out at less than 400 square feet. The \u201clarge room\u201d model (\u201cup to 490 square feet\u201d) is worse, with a CADR of just 65 \u2014 half of what our small-space pick offers. It would struggle to hit 4 ACH in a child\u2019s bedroom. Factor in their grossly inflated prices \u2014 $480 and $200 \u2014 and Sans purifiers are the pinnacle of a bad deal.\n\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 311 Auto and 211+ are former also-great and upgrade picks. They\u2019re excellent, and if you own one of them, there\u2019s no need to replace them. The 311i Max and 211i Max that now hold these spots are slightly higher performing and have improved energy efficiency and liveability features, but the older models are truly excellent in their own right.\n\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 411i Max, a small-space purifier, is physically similar to but less capable than the also-great 311i Max. Given the minor difference in price, we think the 311i Max is the better buy, since it will excel in both bedroom-size rooms and large living areas. The older Blue Air 411 machines (the 411, 411 Auto, and 411+) are former small-space picks, but they are more expensive than the similarly performing current pick, the Blue Pure 511.\n\nThe Clorox Medium Room is a former budget pick. It\u2019s an excellent performer with features we like, including a display shutoff. But the Blueair Blue Pure 511 is smaller, quieter, less expensive, and just as effective.\n\nWe tested the Coway Airmega Icon purifier in April 2020. It\u2019s an interesting machine, straddling the line between appliance and furniture, and it incorporates a second function: It has a built-in, 20-watt wireless device charger. Though it is an excellent performer, we\u2019ve concluded that a standalone (and far less expensive) purifier and a separate wireless charger are more practical for most homes.\n\nThe Mila air purifier became a special-case pick in 2020, as a truly smart purifier that was also a great performer. But since then, decent smart functionality has become commonplace in the purifier category. And after our long-term tester\u2019s Mila inexplicably died, we discovered that her experience was not unique; one Reddit user experienced six failures. Mila\u2019s response\u2014\u201cThere are ~300 customers like you around the world that had 3+ failures. We call you our triple crowners and we wear that badge with shame\u201d\u2014helped convince us to pull them as a pick.\n\nThe Levoit Core 300, a former budget pick, is far less energy efficient than the current pick, the Blueair BluePure 511.\n\nThe Oransi Mod+ is an impressive purifier meant for large spaces. It\u2019s exceptional at capturing particles\u2014on a par with our large-space pick, the Blue Pure 211i Max\u2014and competitively priced, but it lacks some of the livability features we value. It\u2019s louder than the 211i Max, consumes considerably more electricity, and lacks smart capability.\n\nThe Winix 9800 is a solid purifier meant for large spaces. Basically an oversize version of our also-great pick from Winix, the 5500-2, it\u2019s a terrific performer but lacks an important usability feature: Its display only goes dark when it\u2019s on its lowest fan setting, so if you don\u2019t want to sleep in the glow of multiple bright LEDs, you have to give up any meaningful overnight air cleaning.\n\nThe T810 is yet another impressive purifier from Winix, closely resembling the Blueair Blue Pure 311i Max in its form, performance, and sleep-friendly display shutoff. It\u2019s slightly louder, however, and considerably less energy efficient.\n\nThe Dreo Macro Max S is a high-performing purifier with a major flaw: an enormous, bright air-quality indicator lamp that shuts itself off only in night mode, in which the fan is locked on its lowest, least effective setting. The lamp can be shut off at other fan speeds via the app, but, as with virtually all smart purifier apps, this one has many reports of connectivity issues. A manual shutoff option would be an improvement.\n\nBlueair says its DustMagnet machines \u201cpowerfully attract airborne dust particles like a magnet before they settle on floors and surfaces.\u201d But those claims refer to a certain size range of particles, from 0.5 to 3.0 micron\u2014smaller than the human eye can see\u2014so you\u2019d have no way of knowing. In our testing with a professional particle counter, the Blueair DustMagnet 5440i performed no better than the much less expensive Coway Mighty.\n\nLevoit\u2019s Core 600S is a powerful machine designed for use in spaces up to about 700 square feet, at four air changes per hour, and it performed very well in our tests. However, on its medium-high and high speeds, it produced a persistent rattle that we could not ignore nor fix by repositioning the machine and confirming that the filter was properly seated.\n\nThe Honeywell InSight HPA5300B, a large-space model, likely performs well, but after measuring its electricity demands, we dismissed it. It\u2019s an absolute power hog, drawing 33, 60, 94, and 117 watts on its four (low to turbo) speeds, respectively.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s HPA300 performed well in our tests but was also extremely loud, topping out at 62 decibels on its highest setting and measuring 53 decibels on the higher of its two medium speeds. It\u2019s large and visually intrusive, too: a black tower that\u2019s almost 2 feet tall, 18 inches wide, and 10 inches deep.\n\nThe Coway Airmega 150 is the first small-space machine from that company. It\u2019s sharp-looking, with a clean rectangular form and a muted, matte finish available in several colors. But at its typical price of $190, it\u2019s too pricey for a machine made for spaces no larger than a bedroom.\n\nThe Coway Airmega 250 is the larger, more powerful sibling of the Coway Airmega 150. It\u2019s equally attractive, but it\u2019s only slightly more powerful than our top pick, the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty, yet it costs $200 more.\n\nThe Coway Airmega 240, a former pick for special cases, performs on a par with the top pick Coway Mighty and has a sleek design that our staff universally loved. But with more companies paying attention to their purifiers\u2019 appearance, it\u2019s no longer unique in combining form and function at a reasonable price.\n\nThe IKEA F\u00f6rnuftig is neither a true-HEPA purifier nor an especially powerful purifier, period. It\u2019s designed to capture PM2.5\u2014particles 2.5 microns in diameter and above, in contrast with the 0.3-micron HEPA standard. That means it\u2019s optimized for larger airborne particles, such as pollen and mold spores, rather than for very fine particulates, like wildfire smoke (as HEPA filters are). We tested the F\u00f6rnuftig in a 200-square-foot room, focusing on how well it removed 3-micron particles from the air. It disappointed, removing just 85.2% of 3-micron particles in 30 minutes on high and 73.6% in 30 minutes on medium. Its performance on 0.3-micron particles was, as expected, worse: 64.5% removed on high and 53.5% on medium. Compared with other small-space purifiers we\u2019ve tested in the same space, that\u2019s very poor.\n\nWe tested the tower-style Coway AP-1216L in 2017. Despite its decent-to-solid performance, we don\u2019t recommend it. The small footprint of 10 by 8 inches belies the fact that it\u2019s 32 inches tall\u2014the height of a kitchen counter\u2014and so it takes up a huge amount of visual space. You\u2019d never forget that you have a purifier in the room.\n\nThe AirSoap uses washable, electrically charged plates to capture airborne particulates. Our top pick Coway Mighty performed far better in our tests. AirSoap\u2019s claim that it will save you \u201cthousands\u201d in the cost of replacement filters is ridiculous\u2014you\u2019d have to replace the filter on the Coway Mighty 20 times to reach even $1,000, which means you\u2019d have to run it for two decades.\n\nThe Aeris Aair 3-in-1 Pro performs similarly on particulates to our pick for large spaces, the Blueair Blue Pure 211i Max, and it contains a large VOC filter composed of 2.2 pounds of activated carbon and alumina, which should make it far better at capturing VOCs. But it\u2019s expensive, the filters last only six months, and replacements cost about $200.\n\nAir Doctor markets its trademarked UltraHEPA filters as capable of removing \u201c99.99% of particles as small as 0.003 microns\u2014that\u2019s 100 times smaller than the HEPA standard!\u201d Which is factually true, but not unique to their filters. All HEPA filters capture virtually all particles that fall below the 0.3-micron HEPA standard; the standard is set at 0.3 micron precisely because that\u2019s the most difficult particle size to capture.Air Doctor sells four models, the 1000, 2000, 3500, and 5500, which deliver our recommended four air changes per hour in rooms of about 285, 305, 630, and 1,043 square feet, respectively. They cost two to three times as much as our picks for medium and large rooms, while providing no appreciable performance gains.\n\nWe\u2019ve tested many Dyson purifiers over the years, most recently (2019) the Pure Cool TP04 and Pure Hot+Cool HP04. Neither model measured up well against our top pick, the Coway Mighty. We have also found no evidence that the fan function on Dyson purifiers makes them superior to other purifiers in the distribution of filtered air throughout a room. In fact, our years of testing have shown that any appropriately sized purifier will deliver filtered air rapidly into the farthest corner of a room.\n\nThe Medify MA-40 performs similarly to the top-pick Coway AP-1512HH Mighty, but it\u2019s much louder, at 52 decibels (above our 50-decibel definition of \u201cquiet\u201d) on its medium setting and 42 on low. The Coway measured 39 decibels and 31 decibels (nearly inaudible), respectively.\n\nThe huge and exceptionally powerful Medify MA-112 is surprisingly easy on the ears, registering as \u201cquiet\u201d on its low, low-medium, and high-medium speeds (39, 42, and 47 decibels). But at 28 inches tall and 15 inches wide, it\u2019s best suited to large commercial or public spaces\u2014like casinos, which Medify says use the MA-112 to counter the effects of cigarette smoke.\n\nThe GermGuardian AC5900WCA was a star performer in our 2019 test, but we also found it to be much louder than the top-pick Coway Mighty, measuring 47 decibels versus 39, on its quiet/medium setting. And the quality of the sound was rough and whooshy, versus the Mighty\u2019s steady white noise. It\u2019s far more expensive to maintain, as well.\n\nThe Levoit LV-H133 is another competitor to the Coway Mighty. But it\u2019s more expensive up-front as well as over the course of five years of upkeep. And its taller form and higher noise output make it visually and audibly intrusive.\n\nThe Levoit Vista 200 is a small-space machine, and it\u2019s one of the best-selling purifiers on Amazon. However, it\u2019s much weaker in its CADR specs than our small-space pick, the Blueair BluePure 511.\n\nA budget pick contender, the Levoit LV-H132 performed poorly in our tests, reducing particulates in our 200-square-foot test room by just 60% on high.\n\nOur previous top picks among large-space purifiers, the Coway Airmega 400 and Coway Airmega 300, are impressive performers. The same is true of the Coway Airmega 400S, a smart version of the 400. But the Blue Pure 211i Max, our equally capable current pick, comes out on top on price: It typically sells for several hundred dollars less.\n\nWinix\u2019s HR900 Ultimate Pet Air Purifier has lower specs than our less expensive top pick from Coway.\n\nThe Hathaspace Smart True HEPA Air Purifier has solid reviews and typically costs a bit less than the top-pick Coway Mighty. For that price, though, you get a machine that\u2019s barely a third as capable: The Hathaspace purifier can produce, at most, two air changes per hour in a 350-square-foot room, whereas the Mighty purifier can deliver 5.7.\n\nThe GermGuardian AC4825 has been around for years and is, up front, cheap. But because of its higher energy consumption, it costs more to maintain than many more-capable purifiers, and it\u2019s a tall, garish device that won\u2019t blend into any decor outside of an Alien set.\n\nIn addition to the above models, we looked at and dismissed multiple purifiers from the growing crowd of knockoff brands. It\u2019s plainly a Duff Dry situation, and there\u2019s no reason to doubt that these suspiciously similar knockoffs would perform all that differently from the originals. But we place a premium on long-standing companies with a record of customer service\u2014and these pop-up brands lack both attributes. Rather than address them individually, we turned them into a poem, since their names (and this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list) are quite lyrical:\n\nSumgott, Koios, UNbeaten, Zibrone;\n\nAfloia, Aviano, Mooka, Keenstone;\n\nPartu, Geniani, KeenPure, Hauea;\n\nCisno, Druiap, iTvanila, Secura.\n\nThis article was edited by Harry Sawyers.",

HON has failed to impress investors with its recent operational performance due to weakness across its businesses, high long-term debt and escalating operational expenses.\n\n\n\nBased in Charlotte, NC, Honeywell\u2019s diversified portfolio of solutions serves customers globally with aerospace products and services, energy efficient products and solutions for businesses, and process technology, specialty chemicals, and electronic and advanced materials for refining and petrochemicals.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that continue taking a toll on the firm.\n\nFactors Affecting Honeywell\n\nBusiness Weakness: Persistent weakness in the warehouse and workflow solutions businesses due to lower demand for projects has been affecting the Industrial Automation segment's performance. The soft demand for its products and solutions within the sensing and safety technologies business is worrisome. Weakness in the warehouse automation business, owing to lower investments in the market, also remains a concern for the segment. For 2025, Honeywell anticipates that the Industrial Automation segment\u2019s organic sales to decline in the low single digits.\n\n\n\nHigh Long-Term Debt: Exiting 2024, the company\u2019s long-term debt was $25.48 billion, significantly higher than $16.56 billion at 2023-end. The increase in its debt level was primarily attributable to the funds raised for the Civitanavi Systems, CAES, Global Access Solutions and LNG acquisitions. Considering its high debt level, its cash and cash equivalents of $10.6 billion do not look impressive. Also, interest expenses and other financial charges in the fourth quarter of 2024 remained high at $291 million, reflecting an increase of 44.1% year over year. High debt levels can increase its financial obligations and prove detrimental to profitability in the quarters ahead.\n\n\n\nRising Operating Expenses: Honeywell has been dealing with the adverse impacts of the high cost of sales and operating expenses. In 2024, its cost of sales rose 3.7% year over year to $23.8 billion, while selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.6% to $5.5 billion. The company incurred high costs and expenses related to investment in digital infrastructure and business integration activities. Escalating expenses if not controlled are likely to hurt the bottom line in the quarters ahead.\n\nHON Stock\u2019s Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nYear to date, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company\u2019s shares have lost 5.3% against the industry\u2019s 0.8% growth.\n\n\n\nForeign Exchange Headwinds: Given HON\u2019s extensive presence, its businesses are exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations. For instance, foreign exchange had an adverse impact of 1%, each on the Industrial Automation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nDownward Estimate Revisions: In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2025 earnings per share has trended down from $10.70 per share to $10.34 on five downward estimate revisions against none upward. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share decreased from $11.57 per share to $11.21 on three downward estimate revisions against none upward.",

            "content": "Honeywell recently announced that it has agreed to acquire Sundyne from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $2.16 billion in an all-cash transaction. This deal represents approximately 14.5x 2024 EBITDA on a tax-adjusted basis. Sundyne is a leader in the design, manufacturing, and aftermarket support of highly engineered pumps and gas compressors used in process industries.\n\nAdding Sundyne\u2019s differentiated equipment will enhance Honeywell\u2019s Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) business segment\u2019s ability to drive innovation and efficiency while supporting critical energy security needs worldwide.\n\nSundyne\u2019s deep customer relationships, sophisticated products, and technology will unlock strategic growth potential for Honeywell UOP\u2019s value chains in refining and petrochemicals, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and clean and renewable fuels. And the combination will result in an improved product offering for customers as Honeywell Forge, a leading IoT platform, will enable the digitalization of Sundyne\u2019s equipment to enhance reliability and predictive maintenance. Utilizing Honeywell\u2019s advanced R&D capabilities, the combined company will also be able to accelerate further new product development in the pumps and compressors space.\n\nBased in Arvada, Colorado with additional locations around the globe, Sundyne brings approximately 1,000 skilled employees and a significant recurring aftermarket revenue generated from an extensive installed base. And the integration is expected to generate material run-rate revenue synergies with Honeywell UOP process licensing and modular capabilities, as well as a global sales reach.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to immediately accretive to Honeywell\u2019s sales growth and segment margin and to adjusted EPS in the first full year of ownership.\n\nThis acquisition follows Honeywell\u2019s recent announcement of the planned separation of its Aerospace Technologies business along with the previously announced spin of Advanced Materials, which will result in three publicly listed industry leaders with distinct strategies and growth drivers. And throughout the separation execution process, Honeywell intends to continue its portfolio transformation efforts to enhance the value proposition of its businesses.\n\nSince December 2023, Honeywell announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio. And this includes approximately $9 billion of accretive acquisitions: the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems and the LNG business from Air Products. Plus, Honeywell entered into an agreement to divest its Personal Protective Equipment business, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025. Honeywell remains on pace to exceed its commitment to deploy at least $25 billion toward high-return capital expenditures, dividends, opportunistic share purchases and accretive acquisitions through 2025.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s acquisition of Sundyne is expected to close in Q2 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\u201cBy combining Honeywell\u2019s top-tier technology with Sundyne\u2019s leading process industry solutions, this acquisition will further enhance our dynamic Honeywell UOP business and create strategic growth opportunities in attractive verticals. Sundyne\u2019s vast installed base of top-of-the-line pumps and compressors will further strengthen Honeywell\u2019s brand in the process industry and create significant opportunities for us to continue expanding our aftermarket services business.\u201d\n\nVimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell\n\n\u201cThrough the integration of Sundyne\u2019s differentiated suite of products and equipment, combined with the process automation capabilities of our Honeywell Forge technology, we will be able to offer our customers a more comprehensive portfolio of solutions to meet their evolving needs.\u201d\n\nKen West, President and CEO of Honeywell\u2019s ESS segment\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud to have partnered with the talented leadership team at Sundyne over the past five years. Sundyne\u2019s focus on diversifying its end markets, investing in innovative products, and optimizing its operations has set a solid foundation for sustained, above-market growth.\u201d\n\nDan Zamlong, Managing Director, Warburg Pincus\n\n\u201cThe combination of Sundyne and Honeywell will add significant value for our customers, channel partners and employees\u2014and we\u2019re honored to join the Honeywell family. There are numerous benefits that we can achieve together with Honeywell that will accelerate growth and improve efficiency for customers.\u201d",

            "content": "Production in Okinawa, Japan to be the first in Asia Pacific, targeting 200 million liters of ETJ SAF annually\n\nTOKYO, March 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced that Taiyo Oil Co., Ltd. has chosen the Honeywell UOP Ethanol to Jet (ETJ) technology to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Okinawa Operations in Japan. This facility will be based on Honeywell UOP's first ETJ license and basic engineering design in the Asia Pacific region with a production target of 200 million liters per year.\n\nTaiyo Oil Selects Honeywell Ethanol To Jet Technology For Production Of Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nExpected to begin operation in 2029, the facility becomes the fifth of its kind in the world and will provide a vital supply of SAF to both domestic and international markets, contributing significantly to the growing demand for SAF driven by the aviation industry's efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\"For more than 40 years, Honeywell has provided Taiyo Oil with key major refining process units for its Shikoku operations, and we are honored to continue this trusted relationship to help the company advance its decarbonization initiatives,\" said Barry Glickman, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. \"As demand for SAF continues to increase, the aviation industry faces challenges posed by the limited availability of conventional SAF feedstocks like vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste oils. Honeywell's ETJ SAF technology broadens the available feedstock options to help overcome these challenges.\"\n\nHoneywell's innovative ETJ technology helps enable the conversion of ethanol derived from diverse feedstocks\u2015including corn, sugar, and cellulosic materials\u2015into SAF. This fuel meets the rigorous standards of the aviation sector while demonstrating a significantly lower impact to the environment. Depending on the type of ethanol feedstock used, Honeywell's ETJ process provides a cost-effective path for producing lower greenhouse gas emission jet fuel on a total lifecycle basis, compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This technology demonstrates Honeywell's alignment to the global megatrends, including the energy transition.\n\n\"Taiyo Oil's initiative represents an important leap forward in increasing the production of sustainable aviation fuel,\" said Mr. Teruaki Sasaki, senior vice president, SAF Business Project, Taiyo Oil Co., Ltd. \"By leveraging Honeywell's ETJ SAF technology, we will be in a better position to help fulfill the global aviation sector's demand and contribute toward the overall decarbonization goals.\"\n\nThe rising demand in SAF aligns with Taiyo Oil's initiatives to produce ETJ SAF in support of global decarbonization goals. SAF produced from Honeywell's ETJ process can be used as a drop-in replacement that requires no modifications to aircraft technology or existing fueling infrastructure.\n\nAbout Honeywell\n\nHoneywell is an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world. Our business is aligned with three powerful megatrends \u2013 automation, the future of aviation and energy transition \u2013 underpinned by our Honeywell Accelerator operating system and Honeywell Forge IoT platform.

            "content": "Honeywell International recently announced a partnership with Taiyo Oil Co. Ltd. for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Japan using its UOP Ethanol to Jet (ETJ) technology. This significant development aligns with global environmental goals and may have supported Honeywell's 4% share price increase over the past month. Additionally, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share and continued its share buyback program, which could also have positively impacted investor sentiment. Despite the broader market facing declines, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq down 1% and 3%, respectively, Honeywell's strategic moves towards sustainability seem to have bolstered its share price. Furthermore, Honeywell's buyback strategy and the anticipated commencement of the Okinawa facility in 2029 reflect proactive steps in navigating current market uncertainties and future growth.\n\nSee the full analysis report here for a deeper understanding of Honeywell International.\n\nNasdaqGS:HON Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, Honeywell International (NasdaqGS:HON) has achieved a total shareholder return of 75.86%. This performance occurred amid diverse market conditions and strategic endeavors. In 2021, Honeywell's focus on innovative technologies, like the 1-Megawatt generator for hybrid-electric aircraft, underpinned its growth initiatives, alongside a $476 million contract to supply T55 engines for the U.S. Army. Additionally, the February 2021 announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program highlighted commitments to shareholder value.\n\nFurther bolstering financial performance, Honeywell expanded into cybersecurity via a reseller agreement in early 2025, indicating a proactive approach toward enhanced technological integration. The announcement to separate its Automation and Aerospace Technologies businesses by 2026, supported by Elliott Investment Management, suggests a forward-looking approach to value creation. Despite facing challenges, such as underperforming against the US Industrials industry in the past year, Honeywell's strategic adaptations in diverse sectors have influenced its robust long-term return.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 57.4x Honeywell Automation India Limited ( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in India have P/E ratios under 25x and even P/E's lower than 15x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nWith earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Honeywell Automation India has been relatively sluggish. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Is Honeywell Automation India's Growth Trending?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think Honeywell Automation India's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Honeywell Automation India would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 14% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 44% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next year should generate growth of 17% as estimated by the seven analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 25% growth , the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.\n\nWith this information, we find it concerning that Honeywell Automation India is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Honeywell Automation India's P/E\n\nWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nWe've established that Honeywell Automation India currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

Why Trust Us?\n\nWhen temperatures plummet, space heaters often become the go-to solution to the cold and uncomfortable. But these versatile appliances can actually be used beyond just the winter months. They can help take the edge off of a cool spring night, warm up a damp basement, or turn your drafty office into a cozy haven. Some can also even double as fans during the summer. Whether you need a model that can adapt to your needs, or an energy-efficient option to save on your electric bill, the right space heater can make all the difference.\n\nThe best space heaters run quietly, efficiently, and offer multiple heating levels, plus have safety features like automatic shut-off for accidental tipping. And, there are different types of space heaters to consider based on your budget and heating needs, including low-cost electric coil-fan models and heaters that burn propane or kerosene.\n\nWe researched and tested the most promising space heaters from brands like Vornado, Lasko, and Honeywell, highlighting picks we found most efficient, durable, and safe. Read on for our recommendations, along with everything you need to know when browsing options.\n\nBest Space Heaters\n\nBest Overall:\n\nBest Value: Vornado MVH Vortex Heater\n\nBest at Floor Level:\n\nBest for Tabletops :\n\n: Best Smart:\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nTypes of Space Heaters\n\nElectric-coil fan heater\n\nThe most straightforward and least expensive space heaters that blow air over an electrical heating element to produce warmth.\n\nIdeal use: Generating heat in a small area like a shed or office to allow occupants to move about in a small zone of warm air.\n\nCeramic heaters\n\nSimple, affordable, and versatile, these use an electrical resistance element encased in a ceramic block or a ceramic element that is itself semi-electrically conductive and produces heat. The block stores heat and radiates it out as infrared energy. Most of these space heaters have a fan, but a few primitive ones do not. The majority of the heaters on our list fall into this category.\n\nIdeal use: A better and quieter alternative to an electric coil fan heater. These are great for shared offices or wherever quiet heat is needed. Their simplicity makes them quite rugged; they have fewer parts to wear out or break.\n\nGas and liquid-fuel heaters\n\nThese appliances burn propane or kerosene to warm an infrared emitter that projects the energy to heat your workspace.\n\nIdeal use: Construction sites, garages, or work areas are the best places to use these heaters, since you want to place one at a comfortable distance and keep the work area unobstructed. Gas or liquid-fuel heaters direct the heat wherever you\u2019re working.\n\nTypes of Heat\n\nHeat is transmitted in three ways, and space heaters can use all methods or just two. Knowing how they heat is more than an exercise in physics; it can help you select the best appliance to suit your needs.\n\nRadiation\n\nA ray in the infrared (electromagnetic) spectrum travels through space, creating heat energy when it passes through a solid, such as you, furnishings, objects and equipment, or a structure (like your home).\n\nInfrared heaters help warm yourself and objects you come in contact with, like a chair, desk, or workbench. They also work well when aiming heat in a specific direction.\n\nConvection\n\nThis refers to the transfer of thermal energy through a fluid, either by a gas such as air or a liquid like oil or water. Convection heaters elevate the temperature of the air in certain spaces and are most suitable for delivering warmth in an area where you might walk around, like the surroundings of your desk or workshop.\n\nConduction\n\nConduction is the movement of heat energy within a solid by using direct physical contact. Heaters that use conduction have warm surfaces that emit heat in all directions (think of a wood stove). Again, these are another good option for efficiently heating up your space.\n\nSafety\n\nIf you have pets or young children, then choosing a space heater with safety features is especially important for avoiding accidental burns and fires. The majority of the heaters on our list (with the exception of the ) come with an automatic shut-off feature if it tips over. A good portion of our recommended heaters also include a timer to prevent the device from running for the entire day if you forget to shut it off.\n\nHow We Selected\n\nDuring our tests, we evaluated each space heater based on factors that matter most to customers like safety, variety of settings, and more. We paid attention to how efficiently the appliances were able to heat a space, using them around our homes and office. We also took note how many heatings levels each space heater offered and the range of temperatures available to see how much power it uses.\n\nWith this update, we replaced a few outdated or out-of-stock models with new picks that offer variety in the way they heat the space\u2014we included a remote-controlled desktop version and a smart space heater. For options that we haven't had the chance to test, we heavily vetted specs and evaluated each space heater based on the same factors our expert testers used in their initial testing, including safety features, product reviews, and noise levels.\n\nThomas Hengge\n\nThe new models include safety measures such as overheat protection, tip-over senors, and shock-resistant plugs. To evaluate the unit\u2019s heat capabilities, we took into account its temperature range and wattage and prioritized heaters that offered a wide temperature range (and control) and at least 1200 watts or more.\n\nFull Reviews\n\nBest Overall Lasko CW210 Bladeless Tower Space Heater $112 at Amazon$154 at Walmart Pros\n\n\n\nCons Key Specs Type Ceramic with fan Dimensions 7 x 9.2 x 28.05 in. Weight 9.5 lb Heat Output 1500W\n\nLasko calls the CW210 bladeless, because it doesn\u2019t really have a fan, per say\u2014it uses a multi-vane impeller instead. This fan-less design contributes to the appliance\u2019s quiet operation, as it pulls in air through its base and into its tower. It comes with a cleanable air filter, which is accessible via a tool-free hatch at the back of the heater. We also like the sleek touchpad on the front for controlling the wattage for the heating element, tower oscillation, and the eight-hour timer. The space heater only has two actual heat settings, high and low, but there is a manual thermostat for controlling temperatures which can help offset the lack of power options.\n\nThe large window of airflow and even heat distribution help bring a room to a comfortable temperature faster than most space heaters on this list. One gripe: The battery hatch cover on the remote is difficult to remove. It has a holster for that remote control, though, making for one tidy package.\n\nFor a low cost, the Vornado MVH Vortex Heater heats a surprisingly large area\u2014up to 256 square feet\u2014with minimal noise. We used this unit in a bedroom surrounded by outside on five sides, and it held up nicely during cold, overnight temps. We also liked how simple, compact, and lightweight this unit is, and the appliance case stays cool to the touch, allowing you to move it around without worry when its being operated.\n\nThe unit\u2019s controls are a miss for us, though. While we liked the simple on/off button and the three-position toggle for heat level (low 750 watts, medium 1,125 watts, and high 1,500 watts), the thermostat dial is vague. The numbers on this dial range from 1\u20137, which don\u2019t really show how warm each setting is.\n\nAs a result, we had to experiment with different numbers until we figured out a setting that worked best for us (you\u2019ll likely have to do the same). Despite this drawback, the thermostat feature is helpful for when temperatures dip or get too high, as this controls the unit\u2019s auto-shut off/on feature.\n\nThe HeatGenius employs two vertical heating elements, two fans, and a thermostat. Set the fan speed and temperature to heat up a room, or set it to heat just at floor level, mid-height, or in the head and chest area for more targeted heat. This design also has a timer that adjusts the heat over two hours, dropping its output every 30 minutes\u2014after two hours, the heater turns off. It also uses thermal insulated wiring and has a plastic casing to prevent the space heater from overheating.\n\nOne other feature that we like is the appliance\u2019s Quiet Mode which shuts off the lower fan, and runs the upper fan on low speed for almost noiseless heat. We wish Honeywell had equipped this with a cord wrap for better storage, but that\u2019s a design deficiency shared by most small space heaters.\n\nBest for Tabletops Lasko Ellipse Ceramic Space Heater $65 at Amazon$65 at Walmart Credit: Thomas Hengge Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons Key Specs Type Ceramic Dimensions 6 x 6 x 12 in. Weight 3.1 lb Heat Output 1500W\n\nIf your office is frequently cold, then a tabletop space heater might be just what you need to combat the frigid temperatures of your work building. The Ellipse ceramic heater from Lasko is truly a compact model\u2013it's only 12 inches tall, so we found it a rather discreet option for tucking into the corner of our desk or underneath our workspace.\n\nThe highest settings offers a max output of 1500 watts, which pumped out powerful heat in seconds. There are also low and medium power options, and you can manually change the temperature using the touch panel on the space heater.\n\nWe really appreciate that even though this is a smaller space heater, it comes with it's own remote. You can make the space heater oscillate and conveniently set a timer with the press of a couple buttons, and you can view everything from the LED panel on the front of the space heater.\n\nThe only thing we didn't particularly like is that the Ellipse turns on at the highest setting automatically, so you'll have to make adjustments almost immediately to find the ideal temperature and power.\n\nBest Smart Lasko AR122 Therma-Smart Oscillating Tower Space Heater $70 at Walmart Credit: Thomas Hengge Pros\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\nA tech-facing space heater certainly has its benefits. The Lasko ThermaSmart tower heater has Wi-fi connectivity, so you can pair it with the Aria home app for a virtual remote. Pairing the heater was fairly easy: you hold the Wi-fi button on the space heater for five seconds so it enters \"paring mode\", and then connect the device to the app. You can see wattage use and heat levels, and there's a temperature dial in the center of the page to adjust to your liking. The ThermaStart heater can also be paired with Google and Alexa if you prefer to use voice commands.\n\nOtherwise, the space heater has similar settings to other Lasko models that we recommend, like touch-sense controls and a digital window for viewing purposes. There are low, medium, and high heat settings, a max heat output of 1500 watts, and a 12-hour timer function so it can run for most of day. One thing we noticed is that the oscillating feature seems to move incredibly slowly, so you still might get hit with targeted heat if you're sitting directly in front of the heater before it starts the rotation again.",

            "content": "In a world where energy costs continue to soar and the pressure to operate sustainably intensifies, businesses face a significant challenge: the lack of visibility into energy consumption at the outlet level. Depending on the type of building, plug-in loads can account for around 25%-50% of total energy use, and this critical blind spot often leads to inefficiencies that not only inflate operational costs but also obstruct efforts to meet sustainability goals.\n\nImpulse Leisure, a charitable trust managing leisure centres and entertainment venues across Thurrock, Essex, addressed this challenge directly. Despite previous investments in solar panels, variable speed drives, and LED lighting upgrades, the organisation identified ongoing inefficiencies in its energy management approach. To address these operational blind spots, Impulse Leisure turned to Honeywell\u2019s Connected Power Solution for an innovative and transformative approach to energy optimisation.\n\nThe challenge\n\nImpulse Leisure had already implemented a range of energy-saving measures, yet gaps remained. In particular, the reliance on human intervention to switch off equipment in gyms and caf\u00e9s led to inconsistent results. Furthermore, the lack of detailed data made it difficult to assess the performance of aging equipment versus newer installations, inhibiting the ability to make informed future investment decisions.\n\nImpulse Leisure required a solution that offered comprehensive energy insights, minimised operational inefficiencies, and aligned with sustainability objectives, all without complicating daily operations.\n\nThe solution\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Connected Power solution improved energy management by precisely monitoring and controlling energy use at the outlet level. It allowed autonomous shutdown of unused outlets based on occupancy data, cutting waste and reducing manual intervention.\n\n\u201cThis solution has transformed how we manage our energy usage. Beyond the cost savings, it\u2019s given us the ability to make informed decisions that improve operations and reduce our environmental impact,\u201d explained Carl Hayes, Managing Director of Impulse Leisure.\n\nThe system also provided insights through its Map Out tool, which helped optimise equipment usage. For example, the underutilisation of gym equipment was identified, leading to better rotation to prolong product lifespan. Additionally, energy audits showed that bottle coolers with hinged doors used more energy than expected during events. These were replaced with more efficient sliding-door models, reducing energy consumption.\n\nThe outcome\n\nSince adopting Honeywell\u2019s Connected Power solution, Impulse Leisure has seen a 94-95% reduction in overnight energy usage at key sites, including gyms and bar facilities. This visibility and automation have not only reduced costs but also enabled the team to optimise operations and align with their sustainability goals. By automating manual processes and providing real-time insights, the solution has extended equipment longevity and eliminated waste.\n\n\u201cThese results highlight how Connected Power transforms energy management by delivering unprecedented visibility and automation,\u201d said Siddhartha Chatterjee, General Manager of Connected Power, Honeywell. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to support Impulse Leisure\u2019s sustainability journey.\u201d",

Paul was preceded in death by his eldest and beloved son, Douglas Paul Zintsmaster, and is survived by his dedicated wife of 69 years, E. Joann (Hively) Zintsmaster, daughter, Sheila (Chris) Doran of Westerville, Ohio, son Alan (Michele) Zintsmaster of Roann, son David (Irish) Zintsmaster of North Manchester, 13 grandchildren, and nine great grandchildren.\n\nAs a child, Paul enjoyed Saturday afternoon Westerns at the Old Colonial Theater in Wabash, farm life, and fishing in the Salamonie River. In 1949 he graduated as a Lincolnville High School Goldbug, where he played basketball and was one of five students in the last graduating class in the school\u2019s history. The school never had the luxury of a gymnasium, so the basketball team practiced in the school yard and traveled to Lagro High School for games.\n\n\n\nPaul then worked for the Wabash Spencer-Cardinal Corporation making phonograph, radio, and TV cabinets. After he saved up enough money Paul happily bought his first car, a black 1935 Ford Coupe with a rumble seat that was welded shut. In 1952 Paul proudly carried on family tradition when he was drafted by the U.S. Army and trained as a radio operator and Morse Code specialist for the Korean War, where his brother, Daniel, was also stationed. Paul\u2019s grandfather and uncle, Daniel and John Zintsmaster (respectively), both served in the Union Army during the Civil War.\n\nUpon his return from Korea, Paul returned to Wabash and worked at General Tire & Rubber Company, where he met and later married Joann on Apr. 6, 1956, at Friends Church. In addition, he moved to and began farming in Miami County on March 20, 1959, where he resided and worked for the remainder of his life. After 38 years of dedicated service to General Tire, Paul \u201cretired\u201d and worked another nine years for The Cleaning Company at the Wabash Honeywell Center.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Paul and Joann opened up their hearts and their home to 30 foster children and for another 12 adults who needed a temporary home. Paul was an active member of the Wabash Christian and Missionary Alliance Church and the Laketon American Legion Post #402. He served for several years on the Miami County 4-H Council, enjoyed helping people, contributed to the Roann Covered Bridge rebuild, and the annual Stockdale Mill spring clean-up. Paul was an avid gardener who loved to share his produce with family and friends and was affectionately known as \u201cThe Tomato Man.\u201d In his spare time, Paul gathered and cracked black walnuts and hickory nuts, enjoyed reading and eating popcorn.\n\nFuneral services will be 2 p.m. Monday, March 17, 2025 at Grandstaff-Hentgen Funeral Home, 1241 Manchester Ave, Wabash, Indiana, with Pastor Jody Tyner officiating. Visitation will be 2-6 p.m. Sunday, March 16 at the funeral home. Paul will be laid to rest with military honors at Memorial Lawns Cemetery in Wabash.\n\nPreferred memorials are to Roann Covered Bridge Association or Stockdale Mill Association.",

            "content": "Each week, Benzinga\u2019s Stock Whisper Index uses a combination of proprietary data and pattern recognition to showcase five stocks that are just under the surface and deserve attention.\n\nInvestors are constantly on the hunt for undervalued, under-followed and emerging stocks. With countless methods available to retail traders, the challenge often lies in sifting through the abundance of information to uncover new opportunities and understand why certain stocks should be of interest.\n\nRead Also: EXCLUSIVE: February\u2019s 20 Most-Searched Tickers On Benzinga Pro \u2013 Where Do Tesla, Palantir, Alibaba, Nvidia Rank?\n\nHere's a look at the Benzinga Stock Whisper Index for the week ending March 7:\n\nBarrick Gold GOLD: The gold company saw increased interest from Benzinga readers during the week. The biggest reason for the increased attention was likely a UBS analyst upgrade on the stock going from Neutral to Buy with a $22 price target. Benzinga recently shared that the company is getting closer to resolving a dispute in Mali, an item that has hurt the company's financials. Gold stocks could also be seeing increased attention from investors as a possible hedge against tariffs and growing macroeconomic concerns.\n\nThe stock was up 3% over the last week as shown on the Benzinga Pro chart below and shares are up 17% over the last year.\n\nAlamos Gold Inc AGI: Another gold stock seeing increased attention from Benzinga readers during the week was Alamos Gold. The company recently reported a record 2024 performance and predicted that production growth will grow 24% annually through 2027 with continued expansion. The company's fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue each beat Street consensus estimates. The company has now beaten earnings per share estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters and revenue estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nRealty Income Corporation O: The real estate investment trust saw strong interest from readers during the week. The company recently reported fourth-quarter financial results with adjusted funds from operations per share up 4% year-over-year to $1.05, falling shy of analyst estimates of $1.07. The company owns or holds interest in more than 15,000 properties and pays a monthly dividend, which could be a reason for the increased interest. Investors could be looking for investment income and high dividends to offset concerns from tariffs and macroeconomic concerns.\n\nHoneywell International HON: The industrial company saw increased interest from Benzinga readers during the week, which could be related to recent financial results and an acquisition. Honeywell announced a $2.2 billion deal to acquire Sundyne from Warburg Pincus. The acquisition will expand Honeywell's industrial equipment portfolio. Honeywell has now announced $9 billion in acquisitions since December 2023.\n\nThe company recently announced it would separate into three business units as part of a portfolio transformation. The move will include tax-free spinoffs for shareholders.\n\nHoneywell's fourth-quarter revenue and earnings per share beat analyst estimates. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in more than 10 straight quarters. Honeywell's revenue has beaten analyst estimates in four of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nThe stock traded flat on the week and shares are up around 6% over the last year.\n\nAccenture Plc ACN: The IT Services company saw strong interest from readers during the week, which comes after it announced acquisitions and ahead of quarterly financial results. The company announced the acquisition of Denmark-based AI company Halfspace. The acquisition is expected to boost the company's presence in the Nordic and European regions and boost the company's overall AI capabilities. Halfspace, which was founded in 2015, develops AI solutions and products that can be used by companies. Accenture is also acquiring Altus Consulting, a company that provides advisory services. The acquisition is expected to add to Accenture's insurance division and boost its presence in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccenture will report second-quarter financial results on March 20. Analysts expect the company to report revenue of $16.63 billion, up from $15.80 billion in last year's second quarter and earnings per share of $2.82, up from $2.77 in last year's second quarter. The company has beaten estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and seven of the last 10 quarters overall. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in two straight quarters and nine of the last 10 quarters overall.\n\nStay tuned for next week\u2019s report, and follow Benzinga Pro for all the latest headlines and top market-moving stories here.\n\nRead the latest Stock Whisper Index reports here:\n\nRead Next:",

This contract now provides the Kineco Group with the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to supplying premium-quality aerospace composite products,\u201d said Sardessai.GKN Aerospace makes wing structures, fuselages, empennage, and composite engine-housing components for helicopters and business jets. The company is a major supplier for Boeing, Honeywell, Safran, Lockheed Martin, Gulfstream and Airbus.While both companies have been tight-lipped about the details of the contract,understands that this contract could see carbon fibre and epoxy housings for aircraft engines being made in Goa.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nHoneywell plans to acquire heat pump maker Sundyne from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for approximately $2.2 billion, the manufacturing conglomerate announced Tuesday .\n\nThe company will be added to Honeywell\u2019s energy and sustainability solutions segment in an effort to boost innovation and efficiency as well as support security needs worldwide, according to the release.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close in Q2 and will add approximately 1,000 employees.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSundyne, established in 1905, is a leading manufacturer of centrifugal pumps and gas compressors used across process industries, according to a company handout. Outside of the U.S., the Arvada, Colorado-based company has sites in the UK, France, Spain, Japan and India.\n\nWith Sundyne\u2019s customer relationships, products and technology, Honeywell said the company will potentially grow its universal oil product value chains in the refining and petrochemicals, liquefied natural gas and clean and renewable fuels industries.\n\nThe acquisition will also lead to improved product offerings, the company said. It plans to use the internet-connected platform Honeywell Forge to facilitate digitizing Sundyne\u2019s equipment to improve reliability and predictive maintenance.\n\nHoneywell will also leverage its research and development capabilities to accelerate the creation of new pump and compressor space products.\n\n\u201cThe combination of Sundyne and Honeywell will add significant value for our customers, channel partners and employees,\u201d Sundyne's CEO Mary Zappone said in a statement. \u201cThere are numerous benefits that we can achieve together with Honeywell that will accelerate growth and improve efficiency for customers.\u201d\n\nHoneywell\u2019s latest acquisition aligns with its plans to streamline its portfolio as it shifts focus to automation, aviation technology and clean energy. The conglomerate\u2019s strategy includes spinning off its advanced materials, automation and aerospace businesses into three independent public companies by 2026.\n\nHoneywell also made several acquisitions over the past year with the goal of driving growth in those three priority areas. In September 2024, the company completed its $1.81 billion acquisition of Air Products\u2019 liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business. The portfolio is now under Honeywell\u2019s ESS business.\n\nA J.P Morgan global research report projects global LNG supply capacity to increase by 350 billion cubic meters by 2030, driven by increasing liquefaction capacity from North America and Qatar. The report also forecasts that the U.S. is set to become the largest LNG exporter in the world and will produce more than a third of the LNG supply by 2030.\n\nThe U.S. boom is attributed in part to low construction costs and skilled labor, favorable elements that help build out new LNG facilities.\n\n\u201cThe country has gone from effectively producing zero LNG in 2015 to 86 million tons in 2023, with more projects in various stages of construction underway,\u201d Tarek Hamid, head of North American Corporate Credit Research at J.P. Morgan, said in the report.",

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Honeywell International Inc. (HON) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nHoneywell International currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.96, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.96 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 52.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for HON\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HON\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Honeywell International here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Honeywell International, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.",

Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it\u2019s free.\n\nWe don't have much confidence in Honeywell. Here are three reasons why we avoid HON and a stock we'd rather own.\n\nWhy Is Honeywell Not Exciting?\n\nOriginally founded in 1906 as a thermostat company, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a multinational conglomerate known for its aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions.\n\n1. Slow Organic Growth Suggests Waning Demand In Core Business\n\nWe can better understand General Industrial Machinery companies by analyzing their organic revenue. This metric gives visibility into Honeywell\u2019s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, Honeywell\u2019s organic revenue averaged 3.4% year-on-year growth. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy, which can add an extra layer of complexity to its operations.\n\n2. EPS Barely Growing\n\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) because it highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s EPS grew at a weak 3.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. On the bright side, this performance was better than its flat revenue and tells us management responded to softer demand by adapting its cost structure.\n\n3. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping\n\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\n\nAs you can see below, Honeywell\u2019s margin dropped by 3.4 percentage points over the last five years. If its declines continue, it could signal higher capital intensity and investment needs. Honeywell\u2019s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 12.8%.\n\nFinal Judgment\n\nHoneywell\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. That said, the stock currently trades at 19.4\u00d7 forward price-to-earnings (or $211.08 per share). This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere. We\u2019d recommend looking at the most entrenched endpoint security platform on the market.\n\nStocks We Like More Than Honeywell\n\nWith rates dropping, inflation stabilizing, and the elections in the rearview mirror, all signs point to the start of a new bull run - and we\u2019re laser-focused on finding the best stocks for this upcoming cycle.\n\nPut yourself in the driver\u2019s seat by checking out our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week.

Throughout the separation execution process, Honeywell intends to continue its portfolio transformation efforts to enhance the value proposition of its businesses.Since December 2023, Honeywell has announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio. This includes approximately $9 billion of accretive acquisitions: the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems and the LNG business from Air Products. In addition, Honeywell entered into an agreement to divest its Personal Protective Equipment business, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025. Honeywell remains on pace to exceed its commitment to deploy at least $25 billion toward high-return capital expenditures, dividends, opportunistic share purchases and accretive acquisitions through 2025.Honeywell's acquisition of Sundyne is expected to close in Q2 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals.",

            "content": "Research carried out by Honeywell Aerospace has found millennials to be the demographic group most enthusiastic about flying by air taxi in the future.\n\nIn the survey of 1,000 US-based fliers, 65% of those born between 1981 and 1996 said they were keen to use an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, compared to 58% of overall respondents.\n\nRegular fliers, travelling by air ten or more times over the last year, were also shown to be enthusiastic about using air taxis to get around with 67% supporting the travel method.\n\nFor those who have flown ten times or under in the past 12 months, only 56% were eager to try what is considered to be the next significant evolution in travel.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, business travelers are more interested in eVTOL flights than those flying for pleasure.\n\nAeroTime\n\nWhen asked for their main reason for wanting to fly by air taxi, most respondents indicated travel between cities within 100 miles of each other (41%).\n\nBeyond traveling between cities, other desired uses include travel from a suburban airport to a city center (31%) or traveling to a connecting flight in a nearby city (28%).\n\nOverall, 98% of those surveyed would consider taking an eVTOL as part of their travel journey, with respondents citing \u201cnot having to sit in traffic\u201d as a key motivator.\n\n\u201cAnyone who travels regularly knows that the journey to and from the airport often adds unwelcome time, cost and hassle to the overall trip,\u201d said Dave Shilliday, Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Air Mobility at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. \u201cAir taxis can offer a safe, fast and innovative alternative to traditional transport methods.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur research indicates significant appetite for such services already exists \u2013 but like any new technology, consumers need to feel confident about safety, cost and reliability. Air taxis may sound like science fiction to some, but we\u2019re not far from a time when they could become a regular part of travel.\u201d\n\nIn addition to gauging consumer interest in air taxis, the research also highlighted safety as an understandable focus for all fliers, with almost two thirds (65%) indicating that this is an important consideration.\n\nEHang\n\nPublic acceptance of eVTOL is seen as an extremely important obstacle that air taxi developers need to overcome, with a negative opinion among people likely to scupper the new aircraft releasing their full potential.\n\nWhether flying by eVTOL aircraft becomes as normal as taking a bus or train remains to be seen, with critics of the industry adamant that only the very wealthy will be able to travel in this way.\n\nThe Honeywell Aerospace Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research among 1,000 US adult fliers who are ages 18+.\n\nFor the purpose of the survey, \u2018fliers\u2019 is defined as those who have taken at least five round-trip flights in the 12 months between December 5, 2023, and December 12, 2024.",

This includes approximately $9 billion in accretive acquisitions, such as Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, and the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business from Air Products. It also agreed to divest its personal protective equipment (PPE) business, and is scheduled to close that deal in the first half of 2025.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace\n\nHoneywell Aerospace\u2019s technology and solutions are used on virtually every commercial and defense aircraft platform worldwide and include aircraft propulsion, cockpit and navigation systems, and auxiliary power systems. With $15 billion in annual revenue in 2024 and a large, global installed base, Honeywell Aerospace will be one of the largest, publicly traded, pure-play aerospace suppliers, and will continue to increase electrification and autonomy of flight.\n\n\"As Honeywell Aerospace prepares for unprecedented demand in the years ahead across both commercial and defense markets, now is the right time for it to begin its own journey as a standalone, public company,\u201d adds Kapur. \u201cToday's announcement is the culmination of more than a century of innovation and investment in leading technologies from Honeywell Aerospace that revolutionized the aviation industry several times over.

It will also look to digitalise Sundyne\u2019s equipment using its industrial internet of things (IIoT) platform Honeywell Forge to boost reliability and predictive maintenance.\n\nHoneywell CEO Vimal Kapur said: \u201cSundyne's vast installed base of top-of-the-line pumps and compressors will further strengthen Honeywell\u2019s brand in the process industry and create significant opportunities for us to continue expanding our aftermarket services business.\u201d\n\nLast month, Honeywell announced plans to split into three firms. It revealed that its aerospace technologies business would also go, following the announcement in October that it would spin off its advanced materials business, which produces speciality chemicals.\n\nThe spin-offs will provide the individual firms with increased flexibility and position them to create greater long-term value for shareholders, Honeywell said. The separation is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026.\n\nOn the creation of a standalone Honeywell automation business, Kapur said: \u201cHoneywell Automation will create the buildings and industrial infrastructure of the future, leveraging process technology, software, and AI-enabled, autonomous solutions to drive the next generation of productivity, sustainability, and safety\u2026[it] will be better able to capitalise on the global megatrends underpinning its business, from energy security and sustainability to digitalisation and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nSince December 2023, Honeywell has spent around US$9bn buying firms to boost growth. This includes its US$1.8bn acquisition of Air Products\u2019 LNG technology and equipment business.",

Especially with losses of aerospace and terrestrial communications links, satcom networks can enable active troops and battlefield equipment to remain connected at critical times and during highly contested activities.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace has refined its Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency (PACE) approach to the modern connected battlespace to provide consistent and resilient backups for beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) communications under the most challenging conditions.\n\nWes Cook, Director of Technical Sales for the Honeywell Aerospace defense business unit, explains the significance of the PACE methodology: \u201cLosing connectivity in the middle of a flight simply isn\u2019t an option. In a military ecosystem that is more complex and contested than ever before, commanders need redundant, no-fail, BVLOS-capable communications capabilities to gain advantage over their adversaries. That\u2019s where the tried-and-true PACE planning concept shows its value.\u201d\n\nThe PACE method was developed so that a multiple-mission aircraft such as a C-130J can fly from its home base to a theater of operations and back without losing connectivity.\n\nSatellites within a PACE network act as nodes in the sky, moving data back and forth as needed. Honeywell recently demonstrated the PACE approach with its own test bed, based on a suitably equipped 757-200 aircraft from Boeing Co. and Forge software from Honeywell, with minimal loss of data during handoffs between communications methods.\n\nAs Cook noted, \u201cWe were able to aggregate connectivity from all satellite operators into a consolidated Enterprise Management and Control (EM&C) analytics stack, powered by Honeywell Forge, to provide real-time performance monitoring of the aircraft and onboard connectivity systems.\u201d The PACE solution included Honeywell\u2019s JetWave MCX broadband satcom equipment (see image above).",

            "content": "Honeywell released new survey results showing nearly all U.S. airline fliers (98%) would consider taking an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL, as part of their travel journey. Commonly referred to as air taxis, these piloted advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft are poised to enter passenger service in select overseas locations and then will take flight in the U.S. The survey of 1,000 U.S. adult fliers also found that almost 8 out of 10 respondents would travel more often if they could take an air taxi to the airport (79%).\n\nAcross travelers, Honeywell researchers determined that the possibility of reducing overall travel time was the biggest factor in their interest. Air taxis are seen as a much faster way to transition to and from busy airports or between nearby cities, with almost half of respondents citing \u201cnot having to sit in traffic\u201d as a key motivator (47%). Other factors include ease of use and convenience (61%), cost (61%), minimal environmental impact (44%) and the fun factor \u2013 with \u201cnovelty/curiosity\u201d cited by 44% of fliers.\n\n\u201cAnyone who travels regularly knows that the journey to and from the airport often adds unwelcome time, cost and hassle to the overall trip,\u201d said Dave Shilliday, vice president and general manager of Advanced Air Mobility at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies.\n\n\u201cAir taxis can offer a safe, fast and innovative alternative to traditional transport methods. Our research indicates significant appetite for such services already exists \u2013 but like any new technology, consumers need to feel confident about safety, cost and reliability. Air taxis may sound like science fiction to some, but we\u2019re not far from a time when they could become a regular part of travel.\u201d\n\nMillennials are most enthusiastic about flying in an air taxi (65%), compared to 58% of overall respondents, as are those who flew more than 10 times in the past year (67%), compared with those who have taken 10 or fewer roundtrips (56%). Business travelers are also more interested than those flying for pleasure (60% versus 45%).\n\nThe top reason for utilizing an air taxi is traveling between cities that are within 100 miles of each other (41%). For example, an eVTOL is expected to take well under an hour to travel from New York to Philadelphia, compared to two to three hours by car. Beyond traveling between cities, other desired uses include travel from a suburban airport to a city center (31%) or traveling to a connecting flight in a nearby city (28%).\n\nIn addition to looking at consumer interest in air taxis, the research also highlighted safety as an understandable focus for all fliers, with almost two thirds (65%) saying it is an important consideration. This is the case for all type of travelers \u2013 whether occasional or frequent, business or pleasure \u2013 and demonstrates that the industry must ensure that safety is the highest priority.",

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HON options chain for the new April 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $200.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $200.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $198.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of HON, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $209.12/share today.\n\nBecause the $200.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.57% return on the cash commitment, or 4.20% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Honeywell International Inc, and highlighting in green where the $200.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $215.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of HON stock at the current price level of $209.12/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $215.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.25% if the stock gets called away at the April 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if HON shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Honeywell International Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing HON's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $215.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $215.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.43% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.48% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 24%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $209.12) to be 19%.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily HR Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA Christian former employee of Honeywell alleged the company illegally discriminated against him on the basis of his religion when it fired him for refusing to retake a mandatory unconscious bias training, according to a lawsuit filed Feb. 28.\n\nIn Wright v. Honeywell International, Inc., the plaintiff said he completed the training in 2022 but claimed that it \u201cexemplified a belief system that divides human beings into discreet groups based on immutable characteristics,\u201d ideas that \u201cimplicitly and explicitly reject\u201d his sincerely held religious beliefs. He further alleged that Honeywell asked him to complete the training a second time in 2024 and would not grant his request for religious accommodation when he asked for an exemption or for alternative training.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that Honeywell\u2019s HR department threatened immediate termination over his refusal to complete the training in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Honeywell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nHoneywell previously faced a challenge to its mandatory unconscious bias training program from an Illinois employee who was allegedly fired for refusing to complete it. The plaintiff in the case, Vavra v. Honeywell International, Inc., alleged that his firing constituted race discrimination under state and federal laws. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Honeywell and agreed with a district court in holding that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal did not constitute protected activity.\n\nThere are some differences between the two cases\u2019 circumstances, however. Aside from the different categories of discrimination alleged by the plaintiffs, the employee in Vavra had never accessed the training or its contents. This undermined his claim, per the 7th Circuit, because an employee must have some knowledge of an employer\u2019s opposed conduct in order to show an objectively reasonable belief that such conduct violated Title VII.\n\nIn Wright, the employee requested an exemption after already completing the training once, per the complaint. He claimed that Honeywell \u201ccategorically denied\u201d his request without engaging in any interactive process or offering an alternative to the training.\n\nBut an employee\u2019s sincerely held religious belief may not necessarily be enough to exempt them from mandatory training. In 2022, a Maryland federal jury concluded that an employee\u2019s religious beliefs did not conflict with a mandatory ethics course that required him to answer questions about the harassment of a transgender co-worker.",

The deal value is equivalent to 14.5x 2024 EBITDA (tax-adjusted basis).\n\n\n\nBased in Arvada, CO, Sundyne is engaged in designing and manufacturing pumps and compressors for industries including energy, chemical and petrochemical as well as industrial sectors. The company currently employs 1,000 personnel.\n\nAcquisition Rationale of Honeywell\n\nThe latest buyout is in sync with Honeywell\u2019s policy of acquiring businesses to strengthen its business and expand its market share. The inclusion of Sundyne\u2019s advanced products with Honeywell Forge technology will boost HON\u2019s Energy and Sustainability Solutions (ESS) business. This acquisition will enable Honeywell to offer a comprehensive line of solutions in the pumps and compressors space for its customers\n\n\n\nThe acquisition will also create strategic growth opportunities in the process industries and expand Honeywell's global sales reach. Subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the second quarter of 2025. The company expects the buyout to be accretive to its sales, segment margin and adjusted earnings per share in the first full year of possession.\n\nOther Notable Buyouts\n\nAcquisitions are an essential aspect of Honeywell's growth strategy. In October 2024, the company closed the acquisition of Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. for about \u20ac200 million ($217 million) to boost its portfolio of aerospace navigation solutions. With the buyout, Honeywell expects to strengthen its foothold in the European Union. In September 2024, the company acquired CAES Systems Holdings LLC (\u201cCAES\u201d) from the private equity firm Advent. The transaction will augment its defense technology offerings across various domains, including land, sea, air and space.\n\n\n\nAlso, in the same month, the company acquired Air Products\u2019 liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion. The inclusion of LNG process technology and equipment business expertise in in-house design and manufacturing of coil-wound heat exchangers and related equipment portfolio will boost Honeywell\u2019s energy transition portfolio.\n\n\n\nIn June 2024, the company acquired Carrier\u2019s Global Access Solutions business for an all-cash deal of $4.95 billion. The inclusion of Global Access Solutions\u2019 expertise in advanced access and security solutions, coupled with its impressive growth and margin profile, will enable Honeywell to expand its security products portfolio and boost its building automation segment.\n\nZacks Rank and Price Performance\n\nHoneywell currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Throughout the separation execution process, Honeywell intends to continue its portfolio transformation efforts to enhance the value proposition of its businesses.\n\nSince December 2023, Honeywell has announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio. This includes approximately US$9 billion of accretive acquisitions: the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, and the LNG business from Air Products. In addition, Honeywell entered into an agreement to divest its personal protective equipment (PPE) business, which is expected to close in the 1H25. Honeywell remains on pace to exceed its commitment to deploy at least US$25 billion toward high-return capital expenditures, dividends, opportunistic share purchases and accretive acquisitions through 2025.\n\nHoneywell's acquisition of Sundyne is expected to close in the 2Q25, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals.",

            "content": "Airline passengers show widespread interest in piloted air taxis, as travelers embrace the prospect of speedy, convenient and safe advanced air travel\n\nPHOENIX, March 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today released new survey results showing nearly all U.S. airline fliers (98%) would consider taking an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL, as part of their travel journey. Commonly referred to as air taxis, these piloted advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft are poised to enter passenger service in select overseas locations and then will take flight in the U.S. The survey of 1,000 U.S. adult fliers also found that almost 8 out of 10 respondents would travel more often if they could take an air taxi to the airport (79%).\n\nAcross travelers, Honeywell researchers determined that the possibility of reducing overall travel time was the biggest factor in their interest. Air taxis are seen as a much faster way to transition to and from busy airports or between nearby cities, with almost half of respondents citing \"not having to sit in traffic\" as a key motivator (47%). Other factors include ease of use and convenience (61%), cost (61%), minimal environmental impact (44%) and the fun factor \u2013 with \"novelty/curiosity\" cited by 44% of fliers.\n\n\"Anyone who travels regularly knows that the journey to and from the airport often adds unwelcome time, cost and hassle to the overall trip,\" said Dave Shilliday, vice president and general manager of Advanced Air Mobility at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. \"Air taxis can offer a safe, fast and innovative alternative to traditional transport methods. Our research indicates significant appetite for such services already exists \u2013 but like any new technology, consumers need to feel confident about safety, cost and reliability. Air taxis may sound like science fiction to some, but we're not far from a time when they could become a regular part of travel.\"\n\nWho's looking to take an air taxi? Millennials are most enthusiastic about flying in an air taxi (65%), compared to 58% of overall respondents, as are those who flew more than 10 times in the past year (67%), compared with those who have taken 10 or fewer roundtrips (56%). Business travelers are also more interested than those flying for pleasure (60% versus 45%).\n\nThe top reason for utilizing an air taxi is traveling between cities that are within 100 miles of each other (41%). For example, an eVTOL is expected to take well under an hour to travel from New York to Philadelphia, compared to two to three hours by car. Beyond traveling between cities, other desired uses include travel from a suburban airport to a city center (31%) or traveling to a connecting flight in a nearby city (28%).\n\nIn addition to looking at consumer interest in air taxis, the research also highlighted safety as an understandable focus for all fliers, with almost two thirds (65%) saying it is an important consideration. This is the case for all type of travelers \u2013 whether occasional or frequent, business or pleasure \u2013 and demonstrates that the industry must ensure that safety is the highest priority.\n\nHoneywell's Advanced Air Mobility business unit develops nose-to-tail aviation technologies for the aircraft of today and tomorrow. The business unit also collaborates with AAM customers on several fronts, moving with the speed, efficiency and agility that new aircraft developers need. Honeywell's longstanding relationships with OEMs, regulators and partners helps AAM companies accelerate the integration, adoption and certification of next-generation aircraft.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Honeywell Aerospace Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) among 1,000 US adult fliers who are ages 18+. For the purpose of the survey, \"fliers\" is defined as those who have taken at least five round-trip flights in the 12 months between December 5, 2023, and December 12, 2024. The survey was conducted using an email invitation and an online survey.\n\nAbout Honeywell\n\nHoneywell is an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world. Our business is aligned with three powerful megatrends \u2013 automation, the future of aviation and energy transition \u2013 underpinned by our Honeywell Accelerator operating system and Honeywell Forge IoT platform.

With a focus on R&D, digital transformation, and sustainability, Honeywell continues to drive growth in high-tech, high-margin industries.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThis multi-industry giant is currently trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $242.77, reached on Nov. 12, 2024. Moreover, shares of HON have declined 6.6% over the past three months, underperforming the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s ($NASX) 5.8% fall during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, Honeywell has gained 6.7% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind NASX\u2019s nearly 12.8% return. Moreover on a YTD basis, shares of HON are down 6.1%, compared to NASX\u2019s 5% decline over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its bearish trend, HON has been trading below its 200-day moving average since early February, and is trading below its 50-day moving average since early January, with slight fluctuations.\n\nOn Feb. 6, shares of HON fell 5.6% following its Q4 earnings results despite delivering stronger-than-expected Q4 adjusted earnings of $2.47 per share and revenues of $10.1 billion. Moreover, the top line grew 6.9% year-over-year. However, earnings declined 8.2% from the prior-year quarter due to lower profitability across nearly all segments.\n\nWhat disappointed investors the most was Honeywell\u2019s fiscal 2025 guidance. The company expects sales between $39.6 billion and $40.6 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $10.10 to $10.50, both below Wall Street estimates, contributing to the stock's decline.\n\nOn that day, Honeywell also announced plans to fully separate its Automation and Aerospace Technologies divisions. The move is intended to streamline operations and create more focused, agile businesses, each positioned for stronger growth and innovation in their respective industries.\n\nHON\u2019s underperformance looks even more pronounced when compared to its rival, 3M Company (MMM), which rallied 100.4% over the past 52 weeks and almost 18.9% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite Honeywell\u2019s recent underperformance relative to the Nasdaq, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 22 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $240.25 suggests a modest 13.3% premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Honeywell has announced that it has developed a new technology, Digital Holographic Microscopy, that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help count and classify tiny particles or cells.\n\n\u00d7 Expand LookerStudio Shutterstock\n\nThis technology has the potential to be used across many industries where timely analysis and simplified operations are critical.\n\nWithin the healthcare industry, for example, Digital Holographic Microscopy can be used to shorten treatment time for patients receiving at-home peritoneal dialysis. These patients are susceptible to abdominal lining infections \u2013 due to the time it takes to send the samples to a lab with specialised equipment, today it can take 1-2 days to diagnose these infections, during which time the patient\u2019s condition can often worsen if not treated.\n\nTo help address this challenge, Digital Holographic Microscopy can capture images of the patient\u2019s dialysis fluid at the point-of-care by using a portable device with a laser, imager sensor and disposable microscope slide. These images are analysed by AI algorithms to rapidly determine if the number and type of white blood cells indicates an infection so patients can receive appropriate treatment more quickly and effectively.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a growing need for solutions that can provide results that are both rapid and precise, empowering healthcare professionals to make informed decisions quickly,\u201d said Sarah Martin, president of Honeywell Sensing Solutions. \u201cWe have invested in innovations like Digital Holographic Microscopy because of their power to make testing and analysis more accessible to patients while also improving patient care and efficiency across our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBeyond clinical care, Digital Holographic Microscopy can be used in environmental applications to analyse types and amounts of various air pollutants to help achieve safer indoor air levels. It can also monitor cells and other organisms in liquid samples for quality and safety.\n\nAdditional information on digital holographic microscopy\n\nDigital Holographic Microscopy produces high-resolution images without the need for expensive and complex lenses and opto-mechanical systems found in a traditional microscope. Instead, this technology uses light passing through a sample to generate unfocused hologram images, which are then processed by computational algorithms so they can be interpreted.\n\nThis novel technology has advantages over conventional microscopy, particularly because it allows for simple and portable instrument design, which facilitates testing and analysis at the point-of-use rather than requiring samples to be sent to a lab. By using machine learning algorithms to differentiate between types of cells, it also eliminates the need for staining, which simplifies biological sample preparation. In addition, it can replace or supplement sample analysis, enabling faster results with a simplified workflow.\n\nDeveloping solutions that leverage AI and machine learning to help expedite treatment for patients with chronic conditions and streamline laboratory analysis supports Honeywell\u2019s alignment of its portfolio to three compelling megatrends, including automation.",

            "content": "A few months back, we had reviewed Honeywell\u2019s Aviator Hi-Fi Speaker, a good mix of stylish aesthetics, powerful sound and versatile connectivity options. Secure Connections, an authorised global brand licensee of Honeywell, has now brought out the latest line up of Honeywell-branded TWS earbuds and headphones that look smart and sound good.\n\nTake for instance, the Honeywell Moxie V20 Bluetooth headphones. Available for a modest Rs 1,399 on Amazon, these hearables come with an on-ear design and adaptive, soft cushioned earcups ensuring all-day comfort. Thanks to their 40mm dynamic drivers, they produce stereo sound with a lot of clarity and detail. There\u2019s powerful deep bass that pulls users into every beat and sound detail.\n\nAdditionally, these headphones offer a stable connection with Bluetooth V5.4, hands-free voice assistance via the built-in microphone, easy control through user-friendly buttons, and the flexibility of a wired connection with an aux input for uninterrupted listening. There\u2019s also environmental noise-canceling (ENC) for reducing the background noise for those on-the-go calls. Its IPX4 water-resistant rating allows worry-free music enjoyment anywhere, making the Moxie V20 a good outdoor companion for music lovers.\n\nLikewise, the Suono P2200 Bluetooth TWS earbuds (Rs 1,899) come with IPX5 water-resistant technology. With dual 6mm dynamic drivers, these play bass and ultra-clear mid-tones separately. The Bluetooth v5.4 compatibility of these earbuds lends wireless audio comfort for up to 10 metres. There are two built-in microphones that enable users to enjoy clear calling. Moreover, there\u2019s 54 hours of playtime on these earbuds. Users can enjoy effortless control with intuitive touch controls to manage music, answer calls, and adjust the volume with ease. The more tech-savvy lot can even access the phone seamlessly through voice assistance.\n\nOn the other hand, there are dual 13mm dynamic drivers on the Moxie V1400 Bluetooth TWS earbuds. Priced at Rs 1,559, these produce nice stereo sound for calls, music and movies. There\u2019s powerful deep bass too; for an ordinary user, deep bass refers to the low-frequency sounds in music and audio recordings. These low-frequency tones add depth, richness, and intensity to the audio, creating a fuller and more immersive listening experience.\n\nThe Moxie V1400 earbuds come with 45 hours of playback. With its virtual mode, a user can immerse into the gaming world with low latency of up to 40ms. As such, this feature reduces audio latency, which synchronises audio with the device. I liked its seamless pairing with the mobile phone and laptop, also the connectivity is reliable and stable. Ideal for gaming, music and movies.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nHoneywell Moxie V20 Bluetooth headphones\n\n40mm dynamic drivers\n\nBluetooth V5.4, 10m range\n\n25 hours playtime\n\nEstimated street price: Rs 1,399\n\nSuono P2200 earbuds\n\nIPX5 (water resistant)\n\nDual mics & ENC\n\n54 hours playtime\n\nEstimated street price: Rs 1,899\n\nMoxie V1400 earbuds\n\nDual 13mm drivers\n\nFast charging via Type C charging port\n\n45 hours playtime\n\nEstimated street price: Rs 1,559",

            "content": "Honeywell (HON 0.17%) is a $130 billion market cap industrial Goliath. It operates businesses that span from automation to aerospace to advanced materials. The company is an icon on Wall Street today, but in a little over a year the situation is likely to be vastly different. Here's what you need to know if you're looking at Honeywell right now.\n\nWhat is Honeywell?\n\nAlthough correctly classified as an industrial company, Honeywell is really best thought of as an industrial conglomerate. That basically means the company operates in a number of different businesses, each with its own nuances. This isn't an uncommon practice, but there's a pendulum on Wall Street. Sometimes investors want to see companies grow larger through acquisitions, effectively creating conglomerates. And at other times investors want companies to slim down and specialize, which for existing conglomerates means breaking themselves apart.\n\nWall Street has recently been leaning toward the preference of breaking conglomerates up. Industrial peer General Electric recently completed the process, separating out into three different businesses: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, and GE Healthcare Technologies. And now Honeywell appears to be ready to do the same, announcing its breakup plans in early February.\n\nHoneywell had previously announced plans to spin off its advanced material business. But it updated the plan to include the separation of its aerospace operations and its automation business. So, like General Electric, Honeywell as it exists today will cease to exist and it will, instead, be three different companies. The goal is to complete the breakup sometime in the second half of 2026, a bit more than a year from now.\n\nWhat will investors own?\n\nSo the question for investors who own Honeywell today, or who buy it between now and the time of the breakup, is: What will they own after all of the technicalities are taken care of?\n\nFor starters, the process of breaking a giant company up isn't easy. So the technicalities are a big deal, and they need to be monitored. For example: Who's going to be on the different boards? Who will end leading the new companies?

The company is an icon on Wall Street today, but in a little over a year the situation is likely to be vastly different. Here's what you need to know if you're looking at Honeywell right now.\n\nWhat is Honeywell?\n\nAlthough correctly classified as an industrial company, Honeywell is really best thought of as an industrial conglomerate. That basically means the company operates in a number of different businesses, each with its own nuances. This isn't an uncommon practice, but there's a pendulum on Wall Street. Sometimes investors want to see companies grow larger through acquisitions, effectively creating conglomerates. And at other times investors want companies to slim down and specialize, which for existing conglomerates means breaking themselves apart.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nWall Street has recently been leaning toward the preference of breaking conglomerates up. Industrial peer General Electric recently completed the process, separating out into three different businesses: GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, and GE Healthcare Technologies. And now Honeywell appears to be ready to do the same, announcing its breakup plans in early February.\n\nHoneywell had previously announced plans to spin off its advanced material business. But it updated the plan to include the separation of its aerospace operations and its automation business. So, like General Electric, Honeywell as it exists today will cease to exist and it will, instead, be three different companies. The goal is to complete the breakup sometime in the second half of 2026, a bit more than a year from now.\n\nWhat will investors own?\n\nSo the question for investors who own Honeywell today, or who buy it between now and the time of the breakup, is: What will they own after all of the technicalities are taken care of?\n\nFor starters, the process of breaking a giant company up isn't easy.

            "content": "Unlike traditional methods of computation that rely on a Binary language, Quantum computers look to leverage quantum bits or \u2018qubits' instead. Unlike Binary, which is built atop 0 and 1, qubits can be superimposed \u2013 meaning they can exist simultaneously as 0 and 1, or anywhere in between. The result is a system that is able to perform certain types of computation at speeds magnitudes quicker than more traditional approaches. The ability to process vast amounts of data and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers is a key reason why Quantum computing is so important. Their unmatched performance means that such systems boast massive potential for advancements in fields like medicine, environmental science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Before its potential can be realized, there are a few significant hurdles that must first be cleared; namely, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental changes (making them error-prone) in addition to only being effective for specific algorithms. With that in mind, the following are a few publicly traded companies leading the way in the research and development of this game-changing approach to computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a notable name that has made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. For example, by using its \u2018127-qubit Eagle quantum computer', IBM has been able to solve complex problems that long stumped the leading classical methods. Despite the challenges of noise and errors in quantum systems, IBM was able to generate accurate results by using an \u2018advanced error mitigation' technique that were verified by running the problem on a traditional supercomputer for lower levels of complexity.\n\nIn the time since its Eagle quantum computer was released, IBM has already developed a 433 qubit system known as \u2018Osprey' and is expected to soon launch a 1,121 qubit system known as Condor. Each of these successive generations greatly improves upon its predecessor while widening the gap between what is possible with a traditional supercomputer. IBM states that,\n\n\u201cAs quantum processors scale up, each additional qubit doubles the amount of space complexity \u2014 the amount of memory space required to execute algorithms \u2014 for a classical computer to reliably simulate quantum circuits.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential abilities of a quantum computer cannot be replicated by more traditional approaches, IBM notes that it does not envision a future where only one exists. Rather, the company anticipates that both quantum and binary variants will continue to thrive in use cases geared specifically toward the strengths of each.\n\nLooking forward, IBM has already announced its next major goal in anticipation of its current quantum chips \u2018outgrowing' the currently used infrastructure. This goal is known as \u2018IBM Quantum System Two'; a modular system that has the potential to support up to 16,632 qubits.\n\nIBM Quantum System Two: Design Sneak Preview\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nIntel is a pioneer in silicon transistors for traditional computing. Whether a desktop or laptop, the chances are good that, regardless of PC form factor, you have utilized a computer powered by an Intel chip.\n\nAs we make our way through 2023, Intel has forged a clear, yet divergent, strategy for the future that involves quantum computing. Drawing upon its existing expertise, Intel is leveraging its expertise in high-volume transistor manufacturing to develop silicon spin qubits. For example, Intel has developed what it calls the \u2018Horse Ridge II cryogenic quantum control chip' that is said to enhance integration, while its \u2018cryoprobers' allow for high-volume testing.\n\nWorking alongside other companies determined to develop commercialized quantum computers, Intel is also doing its part to help. Currently, Intel boasts the \u2018Tunnel Falls' spin qubit chip as its most advanced offering to date and is, \u201c\u2026making the chip available to the quantum research community to spur advancements in the field.\u201d\n\nIntel Quantum Researchers Introduce Tunnel Falls Silicon Qubit Research Chip\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $138.89B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -157.14\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.68\n\nAt the time of writing, Intel boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nOperating out of Santa Barbara is \u2018Quantum AI' \u2013 an endeavor by Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google. The goal of Quantum AI is to, \u201c\u2026build scalable quantum computers that enable humankind to solve problems that would otherwise be impossible.\u201d\n\nBeyond developing the hardware, like the Sycamore processor, for its own take on a quantum computer, Google's Quantum AI also makes available a suite of software designed to assist scientists in the development of quantum algorithms.\n\nDemonstrating Quantum Error Correction\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.54T\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 22.74\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $4.49\n\nAt the time of writing, Alphabet boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nThe quantum computing division at Honeywell is a joint effort known as \u2018Quantinuum', which also involves Cambridge Quantum.\n\nIt is believed that Quantinuum continues to focus on increasing our understanding of \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. This technology involves utilizing ions trapped in a vacuum, which are then manipulated using lasers, allowing for the ions to behave as qubits.\n\nLike each of the companies listed above, Quantinuum is hoping that its design will allow for high precision, while simultaneously boasting error-correction capabilities \u2013 each crucial if quantum computers are ever to become commercially viable.\n\nIntroducing Quantinuum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $132.79B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 21.84\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $7.70\n\nAt the time of writing, Honeywell boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nWhile it may not have the same name recognition as IBM, Intel, and Alphabet, IonQ has still managed to establish itself as a significant player in the field of quantum computing.\n\nIonQ is known specifically for its research on \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. As previously stated, this is a method that leverages qubits comprised of individual ions suspended and manipulated within a vacuum.\n\nAs it stands, IonQ has reportedly developed quantum computers on par with the most powerful across the globe. In fact, its most recent offering is set to become the first of its kind to be utilized in a commercial setting. IonQ boasts that,\n\n\u201cOnce quantum computers are powerful and stable enough, their unique computational power will solve world-changing problems that are beyond the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers.\u201d\n\nThe company indicates that it hopes to achieve this goal through what it believes is a better approach (trapped ions), than those taken by many of its competitors.\n\nIonQ | The Age of Quantum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.92B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -27.56\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.36\n\nAt the time of writing, IonQ boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.",

With its virtual mode, a user can immerse into the gaming world with low latency of up to 40ms. As such, this feature reduces audio latency, which synchronises audio with the device.

As highlighted by Kiyoshi Inoue of Honeywell, addressing the prevalent challenges of siloed operations and inadequate employee engagement in quality culture necessitates a proactive focus on data integration.\n\nImplementing a robust quality management system (QMS) is crucial for managing quality processes and facilitating informed decision-making throughout the product lifecycle. A closed-loop QMS enhances traceability and communication, enabling organizations to swiftly identify and rectify quality issues, thereby minimizing waste and operational costs. The significance of track-and-trace capabilities cannot be overstated; these systems not only enhance product safety and authenticity but also prevent costly recalls by pinpointing the root causes of defects.\n\nAs organizations navigate cybersecurity challenges and the complexities of data management, adopting a secure, scalable platform like Honeywell's Quality 4.0 system can bolster collaboration and performance.

Among Cortes\u2019 claims was the walk-off grand slam Freddie Freeman hit against him being an improbable outcome.\n\nCortes\u2019 opinion has caught the attention of Brent Honeywell, who joined the Dodgers when he was claimed off waivers last July.\n\nDuring an appearance on the \u201cBaseball Isn\u2019t Boring\u201d podcast, Honeywell predictably disagreed with Cortes and revealed he believed the Dodgers would sweep the Yankees:\n\n\u201cRunning across an empty field was one thing I really wanted to remember. Where, in their own backyard, and I\u2019ll tell you this, they weren\u2019t the best team. On paper, they weren\u2019t the best team. Can\u2019t say it with a straight face.

But they weren\u2019t the best team.\u201d\n\nA rash of injuries resulted in Honeywell being included on the Dodgers\u2019 playoff rosters for the National League Championship Series and World Series. He appeared in a combined three games, largely filling the role of an innings eater as the Dodgers looked to preserve their bullpen amid a shortage of starting pitchers.\n\nWhile Honeywell referenced his World Series appearance as giving up 12 runs, in reality it was five in one inning of work during Game 3. That of course was the only game the Yankees won during the World Series, in some part due to pitching decisions Dodgers manager Dave Roberts made in looking ahead to Game 4.\n\nBrent Honeywell wants to sign\n\nHoneywell has limited experience at the Major League level over parts of three seasons, but did have his best showing with the Dodgers last year. He\u2019s capable of pitching in a variety of roles and does have World Series experience, yet somewhat surprisingly remains a free agent.\n\nIt\u2019s plausible Honeywell is having some trouble fielding Major League contract offers and that in turn is causing a delay in joining a team. The Dodgers presumably would be open to a reunion with Honeywell on a Minor League deal.\n\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel?

            "content": "Honeywell, an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world, announced that it has developed a new technology, Digital Holographic Microscopy, that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help count and classify tiny particles or cells. This technology has the potential to be used across many industries where timely analysis and simplified operations are critical.\n\n\n\nWithin the healthcare industry, for example, Digital Holographic Microscopy can be used to shorten treatment time for patients receiving at-home peritoneal dialysis. These patients are susceptible to abdominal lining infections \u2013 due to the time it takes to send the samples to a lab with specialized equipment, today it can take 1-2 days to diagnose these infections, during which time the patient\u2019s condition can often worsen if not treated.\n\n\n\nTo help address this challenge, Digital Holographic Microscopy can capture images of the patient\u2019s dialysis fluid at the point-of-care by using a portable device with a laser, imager sensor and disposable microscope slide. These images are analyzed by AI algorithms to rapidly determine if the number and type of white blood cells indicates an infection so patients can receive appropriate treatment more quickly and effectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a growing need for solutions that can provide results that are both rapid and precise, empowering healthcare professionals to make informed decisions quickly,\u201d said Sarah Martin, president of Honeywell Sensing Solutions. \u201cWe have invested in innovations like Digital Holographic Microscopy because of their power to make testing and analysis more accessible to patients while also improving patient care and efficiency across our healthcare system.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeyond clinical care, Digital Holographic Microscopy can be used in environmental applications to analyze types and amounts of various air pollutants to help achieve safer indoor air levels. It can also monitor cells and other organisms in liquid samples for quality and safety.\n\n\n\nDigital Holographic Microscopy produces high-resolution images without the need for expensive and complex lenses and opto-mechanical systems found in a traditional microscope. Instead, this technology uses light passing through a sample to generate unfocused hologram images, which are then processed by computational algorithms so they can be interpreted.\n\n\n\nThis novel technology has advantages over conventional microscopy, particularly because it allows for simple and portable instrument design, which facilitates testing and analysis at the point-of-use rather than requiring samples to be sent to a lab. By using machine learning algorithms to differentiate between types of cells, it also eliminates the need for staining, which simplifies biological sample preparation. In addition, it can replace or supplement sample analysis, enabling faster results with a simplified workflow.\n\n\n\nDeveloping solutions that leverage AI and machine learning to help expedite treatment for patients with chronic conditions and streamline laboratory analysis supports Honeywell\u2019s alignment of its portfolio to three compelling megatrends, including automation.\n\n\n\nHoneywell is an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world. Its business is aligned with three powerful megatrends \u2013 automation, the future of aviation and energy transition \u2013 underpinned by our Honeywell Accelerator operating system and Honeywell Forge IoT platform.\n\n",

Read on for our pick of the best dehumidifiers, which we've tried and tested ourselves.\n\n2 Dehumidifiers are worth the investment if you're battling damp patches\n\nTrapped moisture can build up quickly, causing damp spots in your home - and let\u2019s face it, where there\u2019s damp, mould isn\u2019t far behind.\n\nThis is where a dehumidifiers could really earn its keep.\n\nThese nifty gadgets work by pulling excess moisture from the air, making it harder for mould spores, damp, and bacteria to make themselves at home in your home.\n\nBut with so many options out there, varying price tags, water storage capacities and additional features, how do you figure out which dehumidifier is the perfect fit for your household?\n\nWe tested a variety of dehumidifiers - from budget-friendly options to sleek, high-end designs - and in this article, you'll find our top picks.\n\nHow we tested\n\nEach dehumidifier we tested was put through its paces in a real-life home environment.\n\nFirst up, the appearance \u2013 because, let\u2019s face it, no one wants an eyesore in their home.\n\nPrice was a big factor too; it was important to see if spending more money resulted in a better product - read below to find out.\n\nWe tested how much water the dehumidifiers could hold before emptying (these less trips you make emptying a tank into your sink, the better).\n\nTech features like timers and humidity settings were also given the spotlight, and of course we assessed each of them on their performance.\n\nOh, and noise levels were a crucial part of each test, too. No one wants a machine that sounds like a jet engine!\n\nBest dehumidifiers at a glance\n\nMeacoDry Arete One 12L Dehumidifier, \u00a3179.99\n\n2 As you can probably tell, this dehumidifier has been put through the ringer\n\nMeacoDry Arete One 12L, \u00a3179.99 at Meaco\n\nPros: Tailored for UK climate, energy efficient, very easy to use, has an in-built air purifier\n\nCons: Upfront cost, styling\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\nYears of research and development went into creating this dehumidifier, and this Arete One is a compact machine that looks like the love child between a shredder and a kitchen bin (and not in a bad way!).\n\nUnpredictable British weather is the basis behind the design, with a relative humidity of 60% for temperatures between 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, and it really shows when you're using it day-to-day.\n\nIt\u2019s quite powerful and the 12L compressor machine with an accurate, advanced humidistat (which we verified independently), takes a reading every 30 minutes.\n\n\n\nWhy you may ask? Well, it adjusts itself so the output matches external conditions, shutting down in between to save energy.\n\nApart from its outstanding performance, I loved how straightforward it is to use.\n\nYou literally have a power button, a daily use button, a setting for drying clothes and a night mode. Bish, bash, bosh!\n\nA couple of button pushes will put the machine in Smart Humidity Mode, which will take the air down to 55% humidity and switch off, although you can adjust the levels according to your needs.\n\nIf it detects levels have risen again, it will kick back into life with the fan speed and compressor automatically adjusting to moisture levels.\n\nNight mode is quiet; there are no blinking lights, no obtrusive beeps and the speed of the fan powers down to its quietest mode.\n\nI liked how portable it is - featuring easy-rolling wheels and a retractable carry handle, so you can transport it quickly between rooms or get it upstairs without too much effort.\n\nI also loved that it has an in-built air purifier, as it requires one less gadget in the home.\n\nIt has received a 4.9-star rating on airconcentre with praises of its 'great ease of use', claiming that they had 'no more condensation.'\n\nAs you may be able to tell from the image, I've used the Arete One a lot over the couple of years that I've had it. Top tip: Pop it on when you've finished painting to speed up the drying process ten-fold.\n\nDimensions: 47cm x 32cm x 24cm, Weight: 10.9kg, Extraction capacity: 12L (24hrs), Power consumption: 165W, Water tank: 2.5L\n\nRussell Hobbs 20L Black Dehumidifier, \u00a3164\n\nSleek black design that isn't an eyesore, soaks up excess moisture\n\nRussell Hobbs 20L Dehumidifier, \u00a3164 at Amazon\n\nPros: Chic, good for larger rooms, laundry function\n\nCons: Struggles when the tumble dryer is on\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nThe Russell Hobbs Black 20L Dehumidifier was one of the more chic models I tested.\n\nI'm not sure when a law was passed stating that all dehumidifiers had to look like a white goods appliance.\n\nBut my stance is that if they can\u2019t be attractive to look at, then they should at least be able to blend into the shadows\n\nThis one is still quite compact, and being on wheels, it's super-easy to move around.\n\nI will say the 3L water tank could be bigger \u2014 in some rooms I tested it in, it filled within five hours.\n\nHowever, there is a continuous drainage feature, which could come in useful if you\u2019ve got an inside drain, or don't mind having a bucket out.\n\nThis product is perfect if you have a larger room (up to 50m\u00b2) and would also work well if you had an open plan space or a very humid medium-sized room.\n\nIt has a handy LED display which will tell you the starting humidity and then monitor the drop.\n\nThis model has a few different settings depending on what you need. When it\u2019s in a conservatory (which can get very humid), I have it on the continuous setting.\n\nIt brought the humidity down from 82% to 60% in just a few hours of being switched on. The condensation was also gone from the windows in around an hour.\n\nIf I'm using it to help dry laundry in the lounge, I\u2019ll use the \u2018dryer\u2019 setting. I was shocked when it dried my jeans in just a few hours!\n\nDimensions: 51cm x 35cm x 24.5cm, Weight: 14kg, Extraction capacity: 20L, Power consumption: 440W, Water tank: 3L\n\nMeacoDry ABC Range 10L, \u00a3149.99\n\nMeacoDry ABC 10L Dehumidifier, \u00a3149.99 at Meaco\n\nPros: Energy efficient, very easy to use, compact, fairly quiet, easy to empty, laundry mode is useful\n\nCons: Rather heavy even when empty, no castors (but can be purchased separately)\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nI bought myself this dehumidifier to help with a damp problem in my old house, and as strange as it is to say about an inanimate object, I fell in love with it.\n\nIt made a huge difference to the dampness and warmth of the room, drawing out so much liquid that it required emptying at least once a day, if not more.\n\nAs well as helping with my damp problem, I found it very useful for drying laundry in my house with no garden or tumble dryer. I would simply pop it under my clothes horse with a sheet over the top and it would all be dry with the laundry mode within a few hours.\n\nIt's extremely easy to use - it only has a handful of buttons to get to grips with, and you just remove the water tank when it needs emptying. Super simple.\n\nMy only reservations with it are that it's quite heavy. So if you need to move it around your house, it requires a little bit of strength. You can purchase castors separately, which might be helpful.\n\nIn my current house, I require the use of the MeacoDry a lot less due to a lack of damp problems (thankfully!), but I still get it out to help dry my laundry, and when I'm trying to speed up the drying of paint or plaster.\n\nDimensions: 47cm x 32cm x 24cm, Weight: 10.9kg, Extraction capacity: 12L (24hrs), Power consumption: 165W, Water tank: 2.5L\n\nDevola 12L Compressor Dehumidifier, \u00a3139.99 \u00a3119.95\n\nAn easy to use dehumidifier so you can rid your home of excess moisture\n\nDevola 12L Compressor Dehumidifier,\n\n\u00a3139.99 \u00a3119.95 at Amazon\n\nPros: Compact size makes it good for smaller homes, handy display with humidity levels, sleek design, built-in air filter\n\nCons: 2L capacity means lots of emptying\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nAt 12L, the Devola Compressor Dehumidifier is the perfect size for smaller homes.\n\nIt's unintrusive in both stature and noise; it's less than half a metre tall and just over 25cm wide, and at just 36dB (a bare whisper), you'll hardly notice it's there.\n\nDespite this, it's very effective; it reduced the humidity from well over 70% (classed as \"too high\") to under 60% (classed as \"okay\") in under half an hour.\n\nI also liked its sleek design; it has a modern, squared-off silhouette, and a circular light that indicates the humidity levels in the room.\n\nRed means that the humidity levels are over 65%, green means it's between 45% and 65%, while a blue light indicates under 45%.\n\nThere's also a small screen on the top of the device that tells you the exact humidity.\n\nOther handy features include a specific laundry drying mode and a removable air filter, which visibly extracts dust from its surroundings.\n\nIts small size, however, means you will have to empty it frequently; I found myself emptying it at least once per day (often twice if I had washing drying).\n\nDimensions: 47 x 25.5 x 22 cm, Weight: 10.5kg, Extraction capacity: 12L, Power consumption: 185W Water tank: 2L\n\nConopu Dehumidifier, \u00a349.99 \u00a330.99\n\nPocket-sized dehumidifier and costs less than 8p to run\n\nConopu Dehumidifier,\n\n\u00a349.99 \u00a330.99 at Amazon\n\nPros: 8p for six hours, small, great for small spaces\n\nCons: Small, no laundry drying mode\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nDehumidifiers are also a good way to prevent mould and dampness in homes, and I've been trying to avoid using my storage heaters, which cost 77p an hour to run.\n\nSo I decided to turn my attempts towards using a dehumidifier to dry my clothes while combating the cost.\n\nHowever, I found when it came to drying my laundry this particular dehumidifier was a flop.\n\nWhile it promises to remove around 450ml, and the tank was certainly full after each cycle, it just didn't seem to have the ability to help dry my items.\n\nAlthough it was much cheaper than my storage heater, it just didn't work for me.\n\nHowever, that's not to say it won't have a positive impact on mould buildup in your home.\n\nDimensions: 25.6x15x15cm Weight: 1.25kg, Extraction capacity: 450m\n\nREAD MORE\n\nWhat should you look for in a dehumidifier?\n\nWe caught up with Chris Michael, Managing Director at Meaco, and he gave us the lowdown on what to keep in mind when shopping for a dehumidifier.\n\nFirst up, he reckons that \u201cenergy efficiency is probably the most important consideration at present given the ongoing high electricity costs.\u201d\n\nChris suggests having a good look at the wattage and size of the dehumidifier \u2013 they usually come in sizes like 10, 12, 20, and 25 litres.\n\nBy comparing models, you can figure out which one will be the most energy-efficient for your home especially when considering the growing cost of living.\n\nEnergy efficiency is probably the most important consideration at present given the ongoing high electricity costs. Chris Michael\n\nHe warns, \u201cIt\u2019s a false economy to buy a cheap dehumidifier that has a high wattage as the running costs will quickly surpass the initial purchase cost savings when compared to a low energy model.\u201d\n\nConsider slightly spennier pricepoints as it costs you more in the long run, if you buy a cheaper model to save the pennies initially.\n\nAnother handy tip from Chris? Look for a dehumidifier with a laundry mode.\n\nHe points out that this is especially useful now that more people are trying to avoid using energy-hungry tumble dryers to dry their washing indoors.\n\nIn his words, \u201cIn laundry mode, the machine runs for six hours, which is the average time it needs to dry a load of washing, then switches itself off to save on energy bills.\u201d\n\nOh, and here\u2019s another thing to think about \u2013 how noisy is it?\n\nSince dehumidifiers tend to be on for most of the day, you\u2019ll want one that doesn\u2019t sound like a jet engine.\n\n\n\nChris explains, \u201cMost dehumidifiers are placed in hallways or on landings and are often switched on overnight to dry wet washing.\n\nLow noise is important so that people can sleep and live with these appliances.\u201d\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 energy efficiency, laundry mode, and low noise are the biggies when you\u2019re picking out a dehumidifier.\n\nWhat size dehumidifier is best?\n\nWondering what size dehumidifier you need?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Chris Michael, Managing Director at Meaco, has broken it down nice so pick the right dehumidifier for your home.\n\nWhat size dehumidifier for your house? Bigger the home, bigger the dehumidifier Chris Michael, managing director at Meaco explains. Up to 2 bedroom flat house = 10L\n\n\n\n= 10L Up to 3 bedroom house = 12L\n\n\n\n= 12L Up to 4 bedroom house = 20L\n\n\n\n= 20L Up to 5 bedrooms or larger = 25L Make sure to do your research before buying to avoid disappointment by picking a product not suitable for the size of the space.\n\nChris points out that it\u2019s not just about the size of your home.\n\nHe explains, \u201cthe number of occupants and how damp the property gets are other variables to consider when choosing a more powerful model than shown above.\u201d\n\nThe number of occupants and how damp the property gets are other variables to consider when choosing a more powerful model than shown above. Chris Michael\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve got a big family or your home tends to get extra damp, you might need to size up to a more powerful dehumidifier.\n\nHow much does it cost to run a dehumidifier?\n\nTrying to work out the costs before you invest in a dehumidifier?\n\nIt all comes down to a few things: the appliance\u2019s litre capacity, its wattage, and a bit of quick maths using the average unit price for dual fuel customers on standard variable tariffs, which is currently 34p per kWh.\n\nTo give you an idea, let\u2019s take a 12L dehumidifier.\n\nIt uses about 160 watts, which works out to 0.16 kWh.\n\nAt 34p per kWh, that means running it for an hour will cost just over 5p. Not bad, right?\n\nMost of the dehumidifiers we\u2019ve featured come with smart modes and built-in humidistats - which means they\u2019re not chugging away 24 hours a day.\n\nThey\u2019ll only kick in when needed, saving you even more on running costs. Win win!\n\nHow much do dehumidifiers cost?\n\nSimilar to most products, dehumidifiers can come in a wide variety of prices.\n\nUnfortunately, dehumidifiers aren't the cheapest household accessories.\n\nHowever, as Meaco Managing Director Chris Michael says: \u201cIt\u2019s a false economy to buy a cheap dehumidifier that has a high wattage as the running costs will quickly surpass the initial purchase cost savings when compared to a low energy model.\u201d\n\nOn average shoppers, will be looking at around \u00a350 for some of the cheaper variants, and it can range up to a few hundred for any on the more technical side that comes with more functionality and efficiency.\n\nCosts don't end at just the purchase, unfortunately: they're mains-operated, so will use electricity.\n\n\n\nHowever, most dehumidifiers are fairly cheap on energy - averaging at 5p per hour.\n\nWhere to buy dehumidifiers in the UK?\n\nThere's a huge range of dehumidifiers on the market, and knowing what to buy and why can feel overwhelming when you have to fork out the cash.\n\nA fair few retailers stock reputable and own-brand dehumidifiers.\n\nIt is important to buy products for your requirements and not because they're on offer, Chris Michael explains that parting with your cash is worthwhile when it comes to dehumidifiers.\n\nWe spotted dehumidifiers for sale at popular retailers including:\n\nDo dehumidifiers work?\n\nAbsolutely - especially if you follow the advice of Chris Michael above.\n\nAdmittedly, dehumidifiers perform way better in a heated room than in a chilly one.\n\nWhy? Because they need the air to be warmer than the cold surface inside the machine to do their thing properly.\n\nCompressor models are happiest around 20\u00baC, which is bang on the average temperature of most UK homes.\n\nAnother top tip: keep those doors and windows shut while your dehumidifier\u2019s running.\n\nIf you leave them open, the poor thing will have to work overtime trying to dehumidify a much bigger area.\n\nSave it the hassle \u2013 and save yourself some energy costs too!\n\nCan a dehumidifier remove dampness?\n\nOne of the main things a dehumidifier does is zap the moisture out of the air.\n\nIt matters because if the humidity in your house stays at 70% or higher for too long, you\u2019re basically inviting mould to move in.\n\nIts not only gross, but it really can negatively affect your health too.\n\nTo avoid that, you\u2019ll want to bring those levels down to somewhere between 30% and 60%, especially in the colder months when dampness loves to hang around.\n\nNow, how well your dehumidifier can sort this out depends on how sealed the room is.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re running it in a room and someone keeps leaving the door open, you\u2019re just letting more damp air waft in \u2013 so it\u2019s going to take longer to get the job done.\n\nIts advised to keep the room properly shut off while the dehumidifier\u2019s working - so it can focus on clearing the air without any interruptions. Simple as that!\n\nThis is why, to optimise the efficiency of the machine and rid an area of dampness, you need to keep the room totally enclosed.\n\nAre dehumidifiers worth it in the UK?\n\nAbsolutely - for many shoppers this could be an essential purchase.\n\nIf you find condensation beading across your winters in the colder months, you're in need of a humidifier.\n\nIf you don't own a tumble dryer and you find yourself putting clothes on the radiator to dry them off during the winter, again, you need a dehumidifier.\n\nThis shortcut to getting your clothes dry might seem effective, but the amount of moisture sent throughout your home can lead to issues.\n\nThe first is the damp and mould that can often arrive in overly humid indoor conditions.\n\nThe second is a potential by-product of this mould growing in your home - it can affect those with health issues such as asthma and a weakened immune system.",

            "content": "Building managers are reporting the use of AI to help them enhance operational efficiencies with streamlined maintenance, upgraded security and optimized energy usage\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) today released the findings of its AI in Buildings study, which revealed that 84% of commercial building decision makers plan to increase their use of AI in the next year to help them improve security, streamline energy management and integrate predictive maintenance.\n\nIn this study of U.S. building managers and decision makers with more than 250 building occupants, Honeywell found that across property types, respondents are increasingly using AI to help improve process efficiency, productivity and operations. However, since most respondents (92%) reported challenges in hiring skilled, tech-savvy individuals, a greater opportunity remains ahead for building operations to tap into AI's capabilities to enhance employee training, augment their current workforce and ultimately help upskill labor to support the sector's rapidly changing needs.\n\n\"AI in buildings is a game-changer that not only helps decision makers potentially maximize operations and efficiencies, but it can also help improve security for guests, minimize energy usage for tenants and reduce costly downtime by flagging issues before they happen,\" said Billal Hammoud, president and CEO of Honeywell's building automation segment. \"With basic AI functions already integrated into many commercial buildings, leaders should pivot their focus to the upskilling opportunities it presents for employees who can tap into AI to help buildings reduce carbon emissions while being more secure and operationally efficient.\"\n\nFor commercial buildings, Honeywell's research found that AI has moved beyond experimental and is now becoming mainstream, as evidenced by its increased usage for day-to-day building management. Key findings include:\n\nNearly 60% of respondents have already adopted AI to streamline maintenance and repair processes . One of the most common use cases is predictive maintenance, which helps identify issues before they become larger concerns and is currently used by 49% of respondents.\n\n. Security and safety are also top-of-mind for more than half of all respondents . Frequent use cases cited by respondents were monitoring for unusual behavior (63%), location tracking systems for occupant safety (52%) and biometrics-based access control systems (45%).\n\n. Decision makers are turning to AI for everything from temperature control to water usage. More than half (55%) of respondents currently use AI for overall building energy management, 41% use it for water usage monitoring, and 40% implement it for temperature comfort.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the research results and how Honeywell's solutions are helping buildings deliver stronger operational efficiency and fire and life safety, visit buildings.honeywell.com.\n\nMethodology\n\nHoneywell commissioned Wakefield Research to conduct the Honeywell Building Managers Research Survey, which polled 250 U.S. building managers and senior decision makers across building types including offices, hospitals, airports, schools, universities, hotels and data centers. To participate in the research, respondents had to use AI-enabled property management systems in buildings with 250+ occupants.\n\nAbout Honeywell\n\nHoneywell is an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world.

Its portability and simplified sample preparation could enable faster, on-site checks in manufacturing or industrial settings, which often require more elaborate lab-based workflows.\n\nIn healthcare, the technology could cut down the time it takes for vulnerable patients\u2014such as those undergoing at-home peritoneal dialysis\u2014to receive a diagnosis. Traditionally, it can take one to two days to diagnose abdominal lining infections in these patients because samples must be sent to a specialized lab.

We will learn a lot from Honeywell\u2019s technology and create employment to our local people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom screens, flight management systems, control display units, internet connectivity hardware, all these solutions will now be available in Nigeria as they were previously not here. We will also support Honeywell going forward,\u201d Iwuajoku said.\n\nHe assured that the partnership will help local operators to get in-region support, and easier access for engines and parts, modification, and upgrade, and also for the line maintenance on the engines and avionics.\n\nHe said Honeywell has got quite a wide range of products spread over range of aircraft, adding that it is a privilege to have this innovation in the region.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Ivo Heger, customer business leader, business and general aviation, Honeywell said the partnership between both firms is for certain line of engines, such as the TFE731, as well as the APU 100 and \u201cAPU 150 amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on some of Honeywell\u2019s products, he said, \u201cit is first of all the engine, the 731 series engine. Then the APUs, the 36-100 and-150. It is auxiliary power units that get used on the ground before an aircraft takes off, so that they can cool the cabin, run avionics, and start the engines from there as well.\n\n\u201cWe also have full cockpit suites, aircraft instrumentations for display screens, control units, connectivity as well for safety services, cockpit data links and instruments for weather downloads in the cockpit. So, we have quite a vast variety of products that we offer for business and geo-location,\u201d Heger explained.\n\nHe further explained that customers can have support for line maintenance, and if there is a fault in the aircraft that could be repaired in-house, then the aircraft does not have to leave the region for those repairs or for maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe have had discussions on this agreement with Execujet Nigeria for quite some time. And during COVID , everything slowed down from Honeywell\u2019s standpoint and from the general aviation standpoint. So, it was a little bit delayed, but we have got an agreement now where everybody is happy. And we are excited for the partnership.\u201d\n\nShare",

We will learn a lot from Honeywell\u2019s technology and create employment to our local people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom screens, flight management systems, control display units, internet connectivity hardware, all these solutions will now be available in Nigeria as they were previously not here. We will also support Honeywell going forward,\u201d Iwuajoku said.\n\nHe assured that the partnership will help local operators to get in-region support, and easier access for engines and parts, modification, and upgrade, and also for the line maintenance on the engines and avionics.\n\nHe said Honeywell has got quite a wide range of products spread over range of aircraft, adding that it is a privilege to have this innovations in the region.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Ivo Heger, customer business leader, business and general aviation, Honeywell said the partnership between both firms is for certain line of engines, such as the TFE731, as well as the APU 100 and \u201cAPU 150 amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on some of Honeywell\u2019s products, he said, \u201cit is first of all the engine, the 731 series engine. Then the APUs, the 36-100 and-150. It is auxiliary power units that get used on the ground before an aircraft takes off, so that they can cool the cabin, run avionics, and start the engines from there as well.\n\n\u201cWe also have full cockpit suites, aircraft instrumentations for display screens, control units, connectivity as well for safety services, cockpit data links and instruments for weather downloads in the cockpit. So, we have quite a vast variety of products that we offer for business and geo-location,\u201d Heger explained.\n\nHe further explained that customers can have the support for line maintenance, and if there is a fault in the aircraft that could be repaired in-house, then the aircraft does not have to leave the region for those repairs or for those maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe have had discussions on this agreement with Execujet Nigeria for quite some time. And during COVID , everything slowed down from Honeywell\u2019s standpoint and from the general aviation standpoint. So, it was a little bit delayed, but we have got an agreement now where everybody is happy. And we are excited for the partnership.\u201d",

(NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBourgeon Capital Management LLC is an investment advisory firm headquartered in Darien, Connecticut. Founded in 1999 by seasoned financial professional John Aniblo Zaro, the firm specializes in actively managed, separate accounts with investment portfolios consisting primarily of stocks and bonds. In 2002, Bourgeon Capital expanded its leadership team when Michael Keohane joined SAC Capital to co-manage the firm\u2019s long/short hedge fund. With a portfolio value of nearly $535.55 million by the end of December 2024, Bourgeon Capital is known for providing personalized investment strategies designed to manage risk while achieving long-term growth.\n\nJohn Zaro, the firm\u2019s founder and managing partner, has an extensive background in investment management spanning several decades. In addition to his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Economics from Stanford University, he is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and an active member of the New York Society of Security Analysts.\n\nJohn Zaro\u2019s career in finance has been marked by influential roles at major financial institutions; it began at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC where he held the role of vice president from 1984 to 1991. Later, he served as a portfolio manager and vice president at J.P. Morgan Investment Management from 1991 to 1997 during which he managed substantial assets for clients. Just before establishing Bourgeon Capital, Zaro held the positions of Chief Investment Officer and Managing Director at Warburg Pincus Asset Management from 1997 to 1999. During his time there, he played a key role in shaping investment strategies for high-net-worth clients. With expertise in portfolio and alpha target management, Zaro was instrumental in refining investment processes for private clients and high-net-worth individuals.\n\nWith over two decades of experience, Zaro founded Bourgeon Capital with the vision of offering a more client-centric approach to wealth management. His goal has always been to foster strong, long-term relationships with clients through honest and strategic financial guidance. Bourgeon Capital continues to uphold this commitment, ensuring that each client\u2019s investment strategy is tailored to their unique financial needs and aspirations.\n\nIn recognition of his accomplishments in wealth management, Morgan Stanley announced in 2022 that Zaro, then serving as a First Vice President and Financial Advisor at the firm\u2019s Wealth Management office, was named to Forbes Magazine\u2019s prestigious list of Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors. This ranking evaluates candidates based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including industry experience, leadership experience, assets under management, revenue trends, and compliance records. The selection process also incorporates insights gained from extensive interviews.\n\nBourgeon Capital\u2019s investment philosophy is centered on achieving consistent, long-term returns while minimizing volatility. The firm prioritizes risk management by employing strategies that aim to reduce extreme market fluctuations. A key approach under Zaro\u2019s leadership has been investing excess cash in the bond market to capitalize on higher interest rates. This strategy reflects the firm\u2019s commitment to balancing risk and reward while ensuring that clients\u2019 investments align with their financial goals.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Bourgeon Capital\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of Bourgeon Capital\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024. In order to assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from over 1000 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

            "content": "As the world looks for sustainable energy solutions, Artificial Intelligence (AI) may hold the key as using advanced machine learning and data analytics, it can help produce more electricity and fuel, a top leader at Honeywell said.\n\nWith the call for energy systems that provide maximum power, minimal emissions and energy security growing louder across industries, AI offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionise the production, management and consumption of energy. AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for transforming how energy is produced and managed.\n\nAnant Maheshwari, President and CEO (Global Regions), Honeywell, said industrial operations use what is called deterministic AI which is slightly different in approach to the classical generative AI approach.\n\n\"The difference largely is in terms of the dataset that you use and how you create the models on top of it to serve a plant,\" he said on the sidelines of India Energy Week here. Unlike other forms that use probabilistics models, deterministic AI uses highly technical actual data such as that of flying an aircraft or running an oil refinery to create models that can substitute a pilot or a refinery operator.\n\n\"The operator in a refinery is working on a very high value asset and each refinery actually is different. Two aircraft might be similar, but each refinery is different and therefore you got to use the data of that refinery, the use cases that have happened in that refinery over a period of time, so that if there is a new operator or a lower experience operator, you still get to feel as if it's a high experienced operator who's getting all the benefit of other people's experiences on that refinery,\" he said.\n\nIt is also a skilling opportunity because now it can bring people with lower levels of experience to do high-value tasks, which otherwise somebody would have needed 10-20 years of experience to get to that point. \"So, you can accelerate employment much faster, you can grow much faster in the context of India,\" he said. AI can bring higher throughput and productivity. \"So can you produce more electricity, can you produce more fuels or anything like that with the aid of this technology and that is being proven now that with these kinds of capabilities being added, you can get more output out of the asset,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there are certain real-time production applications being deployed. I have seen a promise of up to 10 to 15 per cent in terms of throughput of an existing asset,\" he added. Maheshwari said AI is also beneficial in safety. \"Safety issues are very important in industrial facilities and can AI help you become a more safe operation and that again helps the human capability\". Another aspect where AI can help is innovation, especially in new energy and energy transition. \"I think the AI models can help a lot more in predicting what those operations might be and the digital twins there can help you refine those operations much faster than what you would do in the case of the existing energy assets,\" he said.\n\nAsked about AI's impact on jobs, Maheshwari said it is an opportunity because the energy sector requires very large amounts of experience before people can be put on very critical jobs. \"I think with the aid of AI, you can bring a very large amount of people very quickly into the operating assets,\" he said.\n\nTo buttress his point, he cited the example of an operator with just two years of experience in a plant observing a vibration in the machine. A not very experienced operator would shut the machine and call for help from an expert, leading to downtime.\n\n\"With the help of an AI capability, this operator with only two years experience could actually use even a mobile which is connected to the AI model of that particular industrial plant and say this is the vibration, what do I do in this situation and that particular AI aid to that operator could actually guide the operator,\" he said.\n\nHoneywell, which primarily operates in aerospace, building automation, industrial automation, and energy and sustainability solutions, is leveraging AI across every facet of its business to drive improved productivity, collaboration, and innovation. Maheshwari said India is amongst the fastest growth markets.\n\n\"We are present in India through one of our largest engineering centres on the planet, which is spread across four cities in Bengaluru, in Hyderabad, in Madurai and in Gurgaon. We also have very large manufacturing facilities in the country and we also have listed entities on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Honeywell Automation India Limited, which truly makes us very local in terms of our presence.\" The firm sees \"significant double-digit growth\" in India and expects to maintain that.With call for energy systems that provide maximum power, minimal emissions and energy security growing louder across industries, AI offers unprecedented opportunities, says Maheshwari",

            "content": "Investors may buy stocks for any number of reasons, but when it comes to Honeywell International (HON 0.17%), there's one reason in particular that looks like a good argument for adding it to your portfolio now. However, it might not be the one many investors expect as the conglomerate moves toward a breakup into three separate companies.\n\nThe case for buying Honeywell stock\n\nThe best way to put it is this: Honeywell stock is a good buy not for what the company is now, but for what it could become. This distinction speaks to the two highly complementary arguments for viewing the stock favorably.\n\nA breakup of Honeywell will result in a valuation expansion in its constituent parts, as the value of the sum of the parts is greater than it's being credited with as a single entity. The market will start pricing the newly independent businesses in line with their peers, thus eliminating the current \"conglomerate discount.\"\n\nThe breakup will result in improved earnings at the constituent companies. Hence, the stocks have upside potential even if their valuation multiples stay the same, and the constituent companies might have valuation expansion prospects because of the earnings growth.\n\nThe sum of the parts argument\n\nThe \"sum of the parts\" argument does not offer as strong a buy case as many might believe. As I've written about in more detail previously, Honeywell's aerospace and automation businesses do look undervalued compared to their peers -- but they also are not quite as strong as their peers. Honeywell Aerospace's position in business jet engines, avionics, auxiliary power units, and actuated systems is less powerful than GE Aerospace's dominant position in commercial airplane engines, for example.\n\nSimilarly, Honeywell Automation (which combines industrial automation with building automation businesses) competes with focused industrial/process automation/software players such as Rockwell Automation or Emerson Electric and focused building automation companies such as Johnson Controls. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if a further split between the industrial and building automation business of Honeywell Automation occurred down the line.\n\nIndeed, neither the market's reaction to Elliot Investment Management's call for a breakup in November nor the announcement of the breakup plan in early February ultimately did much for Honeywell's stock price.\n\nAs such, investors buying into Honeywell stock hoping that someone will wave a magic wand and the market will realize that the stock is materially undervalued on a sum-of-the-parts basis will likely be disappointed. With the advanced materials business already set for its spinoff by the end of this year or early 2026, the focus of investor attention should shift to the aerospace and automation businesses.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace\n\nBoth Elliot and Honeywell's management have also made a far more powerful case: Honeywell's current business units will be able to grow more once they are standalone companies. This could lead to a significant price appreciation on earnings and valuation expansions.\n\nAs independent companies, the three also will be more focused and have access to capital comparable to their peers.\n\nThat's likely to be a significant benefit for Honeywell Aerospace, given the premium the market applies to aerospace companies, and it could drive a more aggressive approach to mergers and acquisitions that has been lacking in recent years. Purely by way of example, aerospace-focused advanced composite materials company Hexcel looks like an excellent value and a good fit for Honeywell. Still, its $5.4 billion market cap appears out of reach. The conglomerate's significant acquisitions have been in its Honeywell Automation business -- the $4.95 billion purchase of Carrier's global access solutions business, and the $1.95 billion deal for Air Products' LNG process technology business.\n\nHoneywell Automation\n\nHoneywell Automation's industrial automation rivals such as Emerson Electric have re-engineered themselves into pure-play automation companies with strong positions in adjacent markets like industrial software and test and measurement automation through acquisitions. Meanwhile, Johnson Controls has restructured its building automation segment to exploit the burgeoning growth in commercial and industrial building automation and software.\n\nA stock to buy\n\nIn sum, the reason to buy Honeywell stock is that the conglomerate has an opportunity to improve earnings by hiving off its segments into focused independent companies and investing in their niche markets. Both of the businesses it's spinning off (or, arguably, all three businesses, as industrial and building automation have little crossover) need focused investments, mainly because automation's software and digital elements are on an inexorable rise. Honeywell's aerospace businesses also arguably need investment.\n\nThe upside opportunity is significant, but it derives from the potential for earnings growth rather than on a sum-of-the-parts premise.",

Initially focusing on Singapore's data centres, healthcare, and education sectors, the initiative plans to expand to other Southeast Asian countries and industries over time.\n\n\"Buildings represent a significant opportunity for carbon reduction, particularly when owners can effectively monitor and optimise energy use to manage their environmental impact,\" said Nigel Brockett, President of Honeywell Asia Pacific. \"With the integration of new AI-based technologies and access to our Centre of Excellence, building managers across Singapore can now be equipped with real-time data and automation capabilities to help them curb emissions in alignment with the carbon-reduction goals set out in the Singapore Green Plan.\"\n\nThe Centre of Excellence will utilise the Honeywell Forge Internet of Things (IoT) platform, a predictive maintenance and energy-management software solution. This platform aims to provide building decision-makers with enhanced insights into energy management, optimisation, and predictive analytics that inform maintenance needs.\n\nAccording to the Building and Construction Authority, buildings contribute to more than 20 per cent of Singapore's carbon emissions. By establishing the Centre of Excellence, Honeywell seeks to collaborate with Singapore's building owners and operators, deploying its solutions to support the country's ambition of reducing commercial building emissions. This effort aligns with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the aspiration to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Centre of Excellence in Singapore is expected to commence operations in 2025 and will initially implement building automation technologies through pilot programmes with local stakeholders in sectors such as healthcare, data centres, and education.\n\nIn 2026, Honeywell plans to extend the services of the Centre to other Southeast Asian countries, customising solutions to fit each nation's sustainable building objectives.\n\nLim Tse Yong, Senior Vice President and Head of Mobility and Industrial Solutions at EDB, commented: \"EDB welcomes Honeywell's decision to establish its Centre of Excellence to support the decarbonization efforts for buildings. Given Singapore's focus on environmental sustainability and strengths as an innovation hub, companies can foster partnerships with our built environment and research ecosystems to pilot and deploy sustainable building solutions. We look forward to the impactful solutions this Centre will develop for Singapore and the wider region.\"\n\nThe formation of the Centre of Excellence aligns with Honeywell's strategic focus on automation, as part of its broader industry trends. The collaboration with the EDB underlines Honeywell's commitment to aligning its offerings with key megatrends, particularly in automation.",

            "content": "Over the past year, the Pirates have made some interesting moves, whether that be acquiring an uncharacteristic rental at the deadline, non-tendering a guy they gave two top-20 prospects for, and even designating a player for assignment just short of a bonus. No matter any outside opinions on any of those transactions, there are some that look very good for the organization, and some that were just terrible.\n\nLet's take a look at eight players that were on the Pirates last season, examining four players that the Pirates wish they had for the 2025 season and another four that we are glad are gone.\n\nWhich players from the 2024 Pirates will be missed, and who will be forgotten?\n\nLuis Ortiz will be missed by the Pirates in 2025\n\nTo acquire the future of first base in Pittsburgh, the Pirates had to give up Luis Ortiz, who put together a solid season in 2024, really breaking out and emerging as a starter. His 3.32 ERA, with a WHIP of 1.11 and opposing batting average of .216, will be something that the Pirates must replace. His advanced metrics are not great, which justifies the decision to move him, but nonetheless, he still put together a productive season that Pittsburgh hopes they can replicate from someone else.\n\nAnother major leaguer who got let go a little early was Brent Honeywell Jr., a pitcher who claims he throws a remarkable 15 pitches. He was actually effective for Pittsburgh, but they designated him for assignment after posting a 2.70 ERA in just two outings. The Dodgers took advantage, claimed him, and he got a World Series win with them, yet also improved his ERA.\n\nIt dipped to 2.62, alongside a WHIP of 1.11, and an FIP of 4.27. That is nothing to sneeze at from a fungible reliever, especially for a waiver claim. He is still a free agent, so maybe he returns, but he was certainly an underrated arm the Pirates could have used moving forward.\n\nRHP Brent Honeywell Jr. told reporters he has 13 different pitches he's comfortable throwing in games right now, including a screwball\n\n\n\nHe later changed that figure to 15 \u2014 Andrew Destin (@AndrewDestin1) July 7, 2024\n\nWhen the Pirates acquired Jalen Beeks from the Rockies, there was a lot of excitement, given that Pittsburgh was buying at the deadline, but at first, fans didn't realize what they'd given up. Luis Peralta was the prospect sent to Colorado, and he allowed just seven earned runs in the entire 2024 season with both organizations, including just one at the MLB level. He dominated across many levels, and would have been a solid, young left-hander to keep.\n\nThe last player that will be missed is Patrick Reilly, the young arm given up to acquire Billy Cook at the deadline. In just his second year of professional baseball, Reilly showed how high his ceiling was with an impressive 2024 across both organizations, posting an ERA of 3.47 with a K/9 of 11.01 and a WHIP of 1.18. His stuff is really dominant and hitters struggle against it, but he does walk a lot of batters. Nonetheless, he has a ton of upside that could be great for Pittsburgh to have molded down the road.\n\nPlayers Pirates fans will not miss: Sorry, Ben Heller\n\nNow let's jump into the players we will not miss, starting with Ben Heller. Like Reilly, he brings a lot of great pitches to the table, but his problem was getting tagged by opponents. Heller posted an ERA of 11.25 and a WHIP of 2.08. That is just awful, and even though he does bring some upside, his ineffectiveness hurt the Pirates at a crucial time of the year.\n\nFollowing him is another pitcher who saw a few outings in Pittsburgh: Jake Woodford. The veteran right-hander did string together a few solid outings, but he also was very boom or bust, ending as a bust with a 7.09 ERA and an opposing batting average of .287. Hitters just did not struggle against him and he got hit around a lot, making him unproductive and unmemorable.\n\nOutfield was a position of need last offseason, and the Pirates pounced on Edward Olivares from the Royals to fill in the hole. There were some high expectations from his bat, but he came out and produced a wRC+ of 73 with an OPS of .624. That poor showing sent him overseas to continue his career in Asia, so we can see how much of a failure that was.\n\nLast, but certainly not the least aggravating, is the big outfield pickup from the trade deadline in Bryan De La Cruz. He was expected to be that guy in the lineup that could really hit home runs, but in his few months in Pittsburgh, he hit just three. Not only did he not have a whole lot of power, but his wRC+ was just 37 and his OPS was just .514. That pickup did not work out, and is why he was non-tendered.",

            "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Honeywell International investors that purchase the stock on or after the 28th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.13 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.52 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Honeywell International has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current stock price of US$211.94. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Honeywell International has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nView our latest analysis for Honeywell International\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Honeywell International paid out a comfortable 50% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 59% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNasdaqGS:HON Historic Dividend February 23rd 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That explains why we're not overly excited about Honeywell International's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Earnings growth has been slim and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.",

            "content": "Volna, William Max died on 9 February after a brief illness. Preceded in death by parents Max and Anastasia, son Teddy, brother John and wife Jean. Survived by his children Nancy Jarmulowicz (Paul), Amy Roe (Jeff), Andrew Volna (Stephanie); grandchildren Alex, Britta, Annika, Andy, Katya, Max, Zoe, Louie; nephews Steve, Mike and Tom Volna and his cat Posey. Bill was born in his parents' house at 3006 Ulysses Street NE on 7 March 1931. His brother John - who was seven years old at the time - chose his name. Northeast Minneapolis was his universe, and he explored every corner of it. He knew each street and alley and could tell you - or so it seemed - who lived in every house. Bill graduated from Edison High School in 1949, then pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota. In 1950, when Bill had a part-time job bagging groceries at the National Tea store on 29th and Johnson Street NE, he met a Honeywell engineer and war refugee from Poland named George Kwasniewski. George recognized the sophistication of the projects Bill designed in his parents' basement (telescopes, lens polishing equipment, amateur radios, high vacuum systems) and offered to help him get a job at Honeywell. Thus, at the tender age of 19, Bill landed his dream job working part time in Honeywell's tech lab. And when he graduated from the U of M, Bill moved over to Honeywell's Ridgeway Plant to work as an engineer in their Aerospace Division. After almost 19 years at Honeywell, during which time he married Jean and together started a family at 2218 Roosevelt Street NE, Bill decided to \"cut the rope\" as he liked to say and start his own engineering company. At the end of each day at Honeywell, he and his dad laid the blocks for a building on 18th Avenue and Quincy Street NE. This building would be home to the William M. Volna Engineering Company for the next fifty years, the place where he would, \"make shavings\". Bill was intensely curious and had a restless mind. He was tireless and dove headfirst into quixotic projects, built endless proto-types and filled volumes of notebooks with sketches for products. He relished undertaking outrageously difficult projects for his clients, including his former employer Honeywell, 3M, Unisys, the US Navy and Air Force. He never let facts ruin a good story, especially if the facts got in the way of an important lesson he wanted the story to make, or an argument he wanted to win. An especially notable achievement was his design and manufacture of the Tardis, a mobile and fully enclosed observatory. The Tardis swept the awards at multiple astronomy conventions, including top honors at the annual Stellafane Convention in Springfield, Vermont. When the National Science Foundation asked if they could use his Tardis and bring it to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, he replied that they could use it for free - but only if he could deliver it to the South Pole himself. And so, he went to the South Pole twice - once to deliver the Tardis, and a second time to pick it up. A hero in his life. There will be a public celebration of life event at the Hollywood Theater at 2815 Johnson Street NE on Saturday, 22 March from 1 pm until 3 pm. Friends are invited to share stories.

Initially focusing on Singapore's data centres, healthcare, and education sectors, the initiative plans to expand to other Southeast Asian countries and industries over time.\n\n\"Buildings represent a significant opportunity for carbon reduction, particularly when owners can effectively monitor and optimise energy use to manage their environmental impact,\" said Nigel Brockett, President of Honeywell Asia Pacific. \"With the integration of new AI-based technologies and access to our Centre of Excellence, building managers across Singapore can now be equipped with real-time data and automation capabilities to help them curb emissions in alignment with the carbon-reduction goals set out in the Singapore Green Plan.\"\n\nThe Centre of Excellence will utilise the Honeywell Forge Internet of Things (IoT) platform, a predictive maintenance and energy-management software solution. This platform aims to provide building decision-makers with enhanced insights into energy management, optimisation, and predictive analytics that inform maintenance needs.\n\nAccording to the Building and Construction Authority, buildings contribute to more than 20 per cent of Singapore's carbon emissions. By establishing the Centre of Excellence, Honeywell seeks to collaborate with Singapore's building owners and operators, deploying its solutions to support the country's ambition of reducing commercial building emissions. This effort aligns with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the aspiration to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Centre of Excellence in Singapore is expected to commence operations in 2025 and will initially implement building automation technologies through pilot programmes with local stakeholders in sectors such as healthcare, data centres, and education.\n\nIn 2026, Honeywell plans to extend the services of the Centre to other Southeast Asian countries, customising solutions to fit each nation's sustainable building objectives.\n\nLim Tse Yong, Senior Vice President and Head of Mobility and Industrial Solutions at EDB, commented: \"EDB welcomes Honeywell's decision to establish its Centre of Excellence to support the decarbonization efforts for buildings. Given Singapore's focus on environmental sustainability and strengths as an innovation hub, companies can foster partnerships with our built environment and research ecosystems to pilot and deploy sustainable building solutions. We look forward to the impactful solutions this Centre will develop for Singapore and the wider region.\"\n\nThe formation of the Centre of Excellence aligns with Honeywell's strategic focus on automation, as part of its broader industry trends. The collaboration with the EDB underlines Honeywell's commitment to aligning its offerings with key megatrends, particularly in automation.",

Rashida Tlaib finds Congress\u2019s priorities \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nThe member of Congress from Michigan recently put her colleagues on blast in an op-ed for the Detroit Free Press. Writing shortly after the House of Commons approved a $895.2 billion defense budget, Tlaib pointed out that at least 50 members of Congress owned stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Honeywell and RTX (formerly Raytheon).\n\nDon't miss\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is disgusting that members of Congress benefit financially when they vote to pass more funding for war,\u201d Tlaib added in a post on X sharing the piece. \u201cThis is corruption. They should not be able to profit off death.\u201d\n\nThe issue has been on Tlaib\u2019s radar for a while \u2014 she introduced the Stop Politicians Profiting from War Act in February 2024. And she\u2019s not the only lawmaker who\u2019s growing increasingly concerned about other lawmakers profiting from the power and influence their office lends them.\n\nTlaib\u2019s objections outlined\n\nIn her op-ed, Tlaib writes that she finds it \u201cincredibly disturbing\u201d there are children in the U.S. who are drinking lead-contaminated water while, at the same time, Congress passed a record-breaking $895.2 billion defense budget.\n\nBut, more troubling, she says, is the fact that many of the lawmakers who voted on that near-trillion-dollar budget own stock in the very war manufacturers that stand to benefit financially from this decision.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYear after year, members of Congress continue to funnel billions of our tax dollars to the same defense contractors that some of them are invested in and take campaign donations from \u2014 while our communities are neglected,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe points to analysis done by Sludge, which identified more than 50 members of Congress who own stock in defense contractors that are benefiting from the increased Pentagon spending. \u200b\u200bThe total value of these stock holdings could be as much as $10.9 million as of 2023, according to Sludge analysis.\n\n\u201cOur elected officials should not be able to profit off death,\u201d Tlaib concluded. \u201cThey should not be able to use their positions of power to get rich from defense contractors while voting to pass more funding to bomb people. The American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nRead more: Home prices in America could fly through the roof in 2025 \u2014 here\u2019s the big reason why and how to take full advantage (with as little as $10)\n\nCongressional stock pickers\n\nLawmakers and watchdogs have been debating the issue of whether Washington insiders (and their families) should be allowed to trade stocks for over a decade. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act was signed by President Barack Obama on April 4, 2012.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, as Sludge\u2019s investigation found, several lawmakers have violated this act in recent years. Some critics argue the $200 penalty fee for violating the act is simply too low to deter stock trading based on privileged information.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just defense spending that concerns watchdogs. Rep. Nancy Pelosi and her husband Paul, an investment banker, came under sharp criticism for his sale of shares of tech company NVIDIA just weeks before a Chinese rival caused a blowout. Meanwhile, Rep. Michael McCaul has been pushing for a new cybersecurity bill called the PIVOTT Act while recently purchasing shares of Fortinet, a cybersecurity firm that lobbied for the bill, according to Quiver Quantitative.\n\nThese conflicts of interest were recently highlighted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called congressional stock trading a glaring and \u201cinsane\u201d problem on an episode of \u201cThe Weekly Show with Jon Stewart.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 67% of Americans support a ban on stock trading from members of Congress, according to Data for Progress. With this in mind, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Rep. Zach Nunn, introduced the bipartisan No Corruption in Government Act to block members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (NYSE:MSGE) stands against the other spin off stocks.\n\nA corporate spinoff is defined simply as a firm deciding to split a portion of its operations and distribute the shares to its shareholders. However, the rationale for a spinoff is significantly more complicated, ranging from financial or legal causes to competing strategic agendas. According to historical data, spinoffs and parents both generally outperform the market, with spin-offs having an advantage. A widely referenced research in The Journal of Financial Economics discovered \u201csignificantly positive\u201d returns for both spin-offs and their parent company during the three years following separation when compared to the market as a whole. Moreover, multiple pieces of evidence back up the data. For example, the Invesco S&P Spinoff ETF, which contains companies spun out from larger corporations in the last four years, returned 74.44% in the last five years.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg BNN, shares in companies split out from existing organizations beat the S&P 500 by an average of 10% over the next 18-24 months. Meanwhile, the companies that remain after the split perform in line with the S&P 500 for the year after the spinoff closure date. The pace of spinoffs in the United States is expected to quicken in 2025, owing to a string of recent successful spinoffs and growing pressure from activist investors. Speaking on this, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, stated the following:\n\n\u201cThe strong performance of spinoff companies can serve as a barometer for management teams who are looking for successful ways to unlock value.\u201d\n\nFor example, Honeywell, a corporation located in North Carolina that specializes in aircraft, building automation, and industrial automation, has revealed plans to split into three entities in order to increase stock returns. It intends to split its automation and aerospace technologies businesses by the second half of 2026, as well as complete the spin-off of its advanced materials segment. Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor, asked for the split last October, anticipating that it could \u201cpush the stock up 51% to 75% over the next two years.\u201d Similarly, other firms are also in the process of disassembling themselves. DuPont is to spin off its electronics unit by the end of 2025, resulting in two separate firms, while car components manufacturer Aptiv is also splitting into two.",

            "content": "As the world looks for sustainable energy solutions , artificial intelligence (AI) may hold the key as using advanced machine learning and data analytics, it can help produce more electricity and fuel, a top leader at Honeywell said. With the call for energy systems that provide maximum power, minimal emissions and energy security growing louder across industries, AI offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionise the production, management and consumption of energy.AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for transforming how energy is produced and managed.Anant Maheshwari , president and CEO (Global Regions), Honeywell, said industrial operations use what is called deterministic AI which is slightly different in approach to the classical generative AI approach.\"The difference largely is in terms of the dataset that you use and how you create the models on top of it to serve a plant,\" he said on the side lines of India Energy Week.Unlike other forms that use probabilistic models, deterministic AI uses highly technical actual data such as that of flying an aircraft or running an oil refinery to create models that can substitute a pilot or a refinery operator.\"The operator in a refinery is working on a very high value asset and each refinery actually is different. Two aircraft might be similar, but each refinery is different and therefore you got to use the data of that refinery, the use cases that have happened in that refinery over a period of time, so that if there is a new operator or a lower experience operator, you still get to feel as if it's a high experienced operator who's getting all the benefit of other people's experiences on that refinery,\" he said.It is also a skilling opportunity because now it can bring people with lower levels of experience to do high-value tasks, which otherwise somebody would have needed 10-20 years of experience to get to that point.\"So, you can accelerate employment much faster, you can grow much faster in the context of India,\" he said.\"So can you produce more electricity, can you produce more fuels or anything like that with the aid of this technology and that is being proven now that with these kinds of capabilities being added, you can get more output out of the asset,\" he said.\"I think there are certain real-time production applications being deployed. I have seen a promise of up to 10 to 15 per cent in terms of throughput of an existing asset,\" he added.Maheshwari said AI is also beneficial in safety.\"Safety issues are very important in industrial facilities and can AI help you become a more safe operation and that again helps the human capability\".Another aspect where AI can help is innovation, especially in new energy and energy transition \"I think the AI models can help a lot more in predicting what those operations might be and the digital twins there can help you refine those operations much faster than what you would do in the case of the existing energy assets,\" he said.Asked about AI's impact on jobs, Maheshwari said it is an opportunity because the energy sector requires very large amounts of experience before people can be put on very critical jobs.\"I think with the aid of AI, you can bring a very large amount of people very quickly into the operating assets,\" he said.To buttress his point, he cited the example of an operator with just two years of experience in a plant observing a vibration in the machine. A not very experienced operator would shut the machine and call for help from an expert, leading to downtime.\"With the help of an AI capability, this operator with only two years experience could actually use even a mobile which is connected to the AI model of that particular industrial plant and say this is the vibration, what do I do in this situation and that particular AI aid to that operator could actually guide the operator,\" he said.Honeywell, which primarily operates in aerospace, building automation, industrial automation, and energy and sustainability solutions, is leveraging AI across every facet of its business to drive improved productivity, collaboration, and innovation.Maheshwari said India is amongst the fastest growth markets.\"We are present in India through one of our largest engineering centres on the planet, which is spread across four cities in Bengaluru, in Hyderabad, in Madurai and in Gurgaon. We also have very large manufacturing facilities in the country and we also have listed entities on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Honeywell Automation India Limited, which truly makes us very local in terms of our presence.\"The firm sees \"significant double-digit growth\" in India and expects to maintain that.",

            "content": "The U.S. is implementing new tariffs on key imports, including lumber, cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, as part of its broader trade strategy, while also shifting its approach to combating bird flu through vaccinations and enhanced biosecurity. Meanwhile, the European Commission has approved a \u20ac920 million state aid package to boost semiconductor production in Dresden, aligning with its goal of technological self-sufficiency. In corporate developments, Honeywell plans to spin off its Automation and Aerospace divisions to create three independent companies, enhancing strategic focus. Additionally, U.S. investment in biogas projects surged by 40% in 2024, driven by favorable policies promoting renewable natural gas.\n\nHere is This week\u2019s News:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose new tariffs on various goods, including lumber, cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, with a 25% tariff on lumber expected to take effect around April 2. These tariffs aim to generate significant revenue for the U.S. and encourage other countries to lower their tariffs on American goods. Since returning to office, Trump has already imposed additional tariffs on imports from China and announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on countries with tariffs on U.S. goods. Economists warn that these sweeping tariffs could lead to increased inflation.\n\nAs the average price of eggs in the United States approaches $5 a dozen, the US government is planning a new strategy to combat bird flu. The new administration is going to focus on vaccinations and tighter biosecurity measures instead of the current practice of culling millions of chickens. This shift aims to address the soaring egg prices caused by the mass destruction of infected flocks. The administration is working with experts to develop a plan that includes a \u201cbetter, smarter perimeter\u201d around poultry farms. However, the poultry industry is concerned about the impact on export markets and the logistical challenges of vaccinating many birds. The USDA is expected to provide more details soon. The Egg Clearinghouse or ECI is the \u201cWall Street of Eggs\u201d serving around 5% of the market. Last year they traded over 2.6 billion shell eggs, and are facing unprecedented demand with more bids than supply.\n\nThe European Commission has approved a \u20ac920 million state aid package for Infineon to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dresden as part of the MEGAFAB-DD project. This facility, expected to reach full capacity by 2031, will enhance Europe\u2019s chip production capabilities, supporting industrial, automotive, and consumer applications. The investment aligns with the EU\u2019s goal of boosting semiconductor self-sufficiency under the European Chips Act, which has earmarked \u20ac15 billion for public and private projects by 2030. Infineon, investing a total of \u20ac3.5 billion, has committed to strengthening the EU semiconductor value chain, advancing chip R&D, and prioritizing supply in times of crisis.\n\nHoneywell announced plans to separate its Automation and Aerospace businesses into independent, publicly traded companies, alongside the previously announced spinoff of its Advanced Materials division. This strategic move, expected to be completed tax-free for shareholders in the second half of 2026, aims to create three focused industry leaders. Honeywell Automation will lead in industrial automation and AI-driven solutions, Honeywell Aerospace will continue innovating in aviation technology, and Advanced Materials will specialize in sustainability-focused specialty chemicals. The separation is intended to enhance strategic focus, financial flexibility, and shareholder value, aligning with Honeywell\u2019s broader portfolio optimization and investment strategy.\n\nInvestment in U.S. biogas projects grew by 40% year over year in 2024, with a 17% increase in new facilities, bringing the total to nearly 2,500, according to the American Biogas Council. While wastewater treatment plants remain the largest sector, agriculture-based digesters saw the most growth, expanding by 24%. Favorable policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard and state clean fuel programs, have driven a shift toward producing renewable natural gas (RNG), with 95% of new projects focused on RNG rather than electricity generation. Despite challenges like permitting delays in the landfill sector, industry leaders see strong potential for further expansion, with ABC estimating over 15,000 additional viable biogas sites in the U.S. The council continues to advocate for supportive policies, particularly tax credits and fuel regulations that do not favor electrification over natural gas-fueled vehicles.\n\nSong of the Week:",

            "content": "Earlier this month, industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON 0.17%) announced plans to break itself up into three stand-alone publicly traded entities. But if it was hoping to reignite investor excitement, it hasn't worked. Honeywell's stock is down this year even as the industrial sector has rallied more than 5%. Zoom out over the past five years, and Honeywell is up just 17% compared to the sector's gain of 65%.\n\nHere's why Honeywell is breaking up, what the new business could look like, and whether the dividend stock is worth buying now.\n\nHoneywell's growth has ground to a halt\n\nIt wasn't long ago that General Electric was one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap that peaked over $450 billion in 1999. But GE began focusing on quarterly profits at the expense of long-term vision, and its conglomerate structure became a hinderance rather than an advantage. In 2018, GE lost its spot in the storied Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -1.30%) as the company's stock hovered around multiyear lows.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, GE split into three public companies -- GE Aerospace, GE Vernova, and GE HealthCare Technologies. The move was meant to unlock value by giving each business unit a clear investment thesis and an easier path to growth by avoiding the red tape that can come with a slower-moving, larger conglomerate. The strategy was a resounding success, with GE Vernova, the renewable energy business, becoming one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.39%) last year.\n\nIt's this model of value creation that Honeywell's investors must be hoping plays out now.\n\nHoneywell's stock price has underperformed the industrial sector for good reasons. Its revenue and earnings growth have been poor, and the outlook for 2025 isn't great. In 2024, Honeywell grew sales and operating income by just 5%. For 2025, it expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of just 2% to 6%, or $10.10 to $10.50 per share.\n\nAs you can see in this chart, Honeywell's stock price has outpaced its earnings, operating income, and revenue growth over the last decade.\n\nGranted, EPS has grown faster than operating income over the past decade because Honeywell has been buying back stock and decreasing its share count. But still, Honeywell's results are quite disappointing, especially for a company with a track record of industry leadership.\n\nReminding Honeywell of its past success was the essence of activist investor Elliott Investment Management's 23-page letter to Honeywell in November. Similar to GE, Elliott argued that the conglomerate structure that once benefited Honeywell was now holding it back, and that the company could be far more innovative and rewarding to its shareholders if it broke up.\n\nIn addition to announcing its earnings results on Feb. 6, Honeywell released a separate press release and presentation describing its logic for breaking up. Management discussed the breakup in detail on the earnings call as well. Now, investors finally have a better idea of what the business could look like post-breakup.\n\nThe new Honeywell\n\nHoneywell is reorganizing its four segments -- Aerospace Technologies, Industrial Automation, Building Automation, and Energy and Sustainability Solutions -- into three new companies.\n\nAdvanced Materials will be a special chemicals and materials company. The segment brought in about $4 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace builds on Honeywell's experience with auxiliary power units, engines, and Honeywell Avionics (electronic systems and equipment used in commercial and military aircraft). Honeywell Aerospace will be a supplier for virtually every commercial, defense, and space platform. Growth opportunities include updating legacy fleets with new autonomous technology, electrification, emissions reductions, and more. Honeywell Aerospace made about $15 billion in 2024 revenue.\n\nLast year, Honeywell Automation had about $18 billion in revenue. Honeywell Automation has a multidecade track record in industrial, energy, process, and building end markets. The company's services, software, and technology improves efficiency for building processes, warehouses, manufacturing, and bridges the gap between automation and autonomy. Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said the following on the fourth-quarter earnings call:\n\nIn an automated facility, machines with preprogrammed instructions and deterministic outcomes govern the industrial process. But in an autonomous facility, systems or machines can analyze years of historical data and make recommendations and decisions that adapt to new conditions, changing environments, or unanticipated problems. We believe this momentum will only accelerate in coming years and continue to drive increased demand for high-quality sensors, controls, process, and software technology, all of which are right in Honeywell's wheelhouse.\n\nIn sum, Honeywell Automation will focus on digital transformation, energy security, and industrial autonomy.\n\nExpect a prolonged turnaround\n\nAs my colleague Lee Samaha points out, Honeywell Aerospace's operating margins are lower than its peers', and Honeywell Automation's organic sales growth is declining. So Honeywell trades at a discount to comparable companies not because the conglomerate structure is hiding its value, but because the business isn't as strong.\n\nSo, unlike GE, Honeywell's spin-off probably won't automatically translate into shareholder value creation. What's more, the spin-off isn't even expected to be complete until the second half of 2026. And with weak guidance for 2025, there's no clear near-term upside for owning Honeywell.\n\nThe good news is that Honeywell pays an attractive dividend and has a reasonable valuation. Honeywell has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years and currently yields 2.2% -- a full percentage point above the S&P 500 average of 1.2%.\n\nBased on EPS of $10.30 -- which is the midpoint of 2025 adjusted EPS guidance -- and a share price around $210 at the close of Wednesday's trading, Honeywell has a forward adjusted price-to-earnings ratio around 20 -- which is a good deal if Honeywell can return to growth. However, if Honeywell remains a low-growth company, that valuation will be decent at best. For example, Lockheed Martin, a major defense contractor growing earnings at a slow and steady rate, has a higher yield and a lower valuation than Honeywell.\n\nHoneywell could be worth a closer look\n\nThere's an inherent amount of speculation that comes with approaching Honeywell right now. In hindsight, the stock could look like a bargain if it can spur innovation and accelerate earnings growth as three separate companies. But if that doesn't happen, there are better deals out there for value and income investors.\n\nTherefore, investors should only buy Honeywell if they believe the business has operational advantages that the conglomerate model has squandered. But it's also OK to take a wait-and-see approach to Honeywell.\n\nAnother idea is to identify the part of the company most attractive to you and then invest in that entity post-break up. As we saw with GE, each entity has a different investment thesis, dividend yield, and balance sheet.\n\nIn sum, just because Honeywell is down over 10% year-to-date doesn't automatically make it a great value, but Honeywell could still be worth buying if you believe the spin-off will produce gains down the road.",

            "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Honeywell International Inc. ( ). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$236 and falling to the lows of US$203. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Honeywell International's current trading price of US$211 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Honeywell International\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nIs Honeywell International Still Cheap?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Honeywell International seems to be fairly priced at around 4.7% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Honeywell International today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $221.16, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Honeywell International\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Honeywell International look like?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Honeywell International's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? HON\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on HON, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

            "content": "Warehouse automation with Honeywell\n\nWalter Groenewald, Presales Lead for Honeywell Industrial Automation in META, identifies the two key trends driving changes in the warehousing industry as being digitisation and automation. Both of these developments are already well under way, and Honeywell and Kemtek are continuing to spearhead transformative innovations.\n\nWalter Groenewald \u2013 Honeywell - Technical Services Leader (MERTA). (Image: Supplied)\n\nThe automation spectrum\n\nMany modern warehouses and distribution centres run on a semi-automated basis, and can be identified as being somewhere along a spectrum that begins with zero automation and ends with fully automated facilities that require no human intervention.\n\nMoving along this trajectory requires the ability to integrate with legacy systems and datasets, and repurpose human resources for better skilled and more rewarding roles.\n\nThe power of data\n\nThe internet of things (IOT) and machine learning (ML) are key factors in this process. IOT generates datapoints from connected sensors, which is then used by ML algorithms to identify trends and anomalies, and fine-tune processes. Together, these two advances are driving business intelligence (BI), which turns raw data into usable information and actionable insights.\n\nThese systems come to the fore in sorting scenarios, where they are able to identify, track and direct items in transit. Enhanced traceability leads to business savings, and is experienced by customers as automated notifications on the progress of their deliveries and simplified returns processes.\n\nThis move towards full visibility throughout supply chains not only boosts customer satisfaction and retention, but assists businesses with achieving complete regulatory compliance.\n\nWarehouse automation challenges\n\nThe promise and potential of warehouse automation technologies are undeniable, but as with all advances, there are perceived challenges. These include the lengthy ROI on investment in automation (despite the immediate and quantifiable efficiency gains) and the need to balance the needs of the business with human and social factors. Honeywell \u2013 whose whole approach to warehouse automation is premised on developing technologies that meet identified business needs \u2013 believes that these issues are best addressed by being seen as upskilling opportunities.\n\nImproving conditions for operatives\n\nMany of Honeywell\u2019s warehouse automation devices are engineered to help warehouse operators achieve more in less time, but in ways that are safer, more comfortable and require less physical effort. Handheld devices (including bar code scanners and mobile computers) are increasingly digitising what was once a purely manual task. The data they capture can then be used to assist warehouse staff in making decisions.\n\nBusiness intelligence can very quickly learn how a specific warehouse runs, and recommend improvements such as optimised picking paths and inventory allocations.\n\nThe devices themselves are being designed to be more rugged, more ergonomic and, above all, able to add more value.\n\nEliminating errors\n\nThe latest Honeywell handheld bar code scanners feature impressive capabilities that feed into the warehouse automation trend. These include faster, more accurate scanning and improved abilities to deal with environmental factors and degraded bar codes.\n\nIntegrating AI\n\nThe ability of dynamic AI algorithms to adapt to changing circumstances and manage variability is improving all the time, and this is an innovation where Honeywell is once again leading the field. The value of AI becomes even more apparent as systems scale and the volume of data involved begins to exceed human capacities.\n\n(Image: Supplied)\n\nWarehousing as a system\n\nHoneywell\u2019s consultative approach to research and development is already bearing dividends for warehouse owners. For example, improvements in connectivity help scanners integrate seamlessly into the overall system and ensure the flow of high-quality information throughout the entire system. Advances such as machine vision and object recognition are already coming on stream, and helping to further reinforce data flows by eliminating errors.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the future of warehousing is in safe hands with Honeywell and Kemtek, and furthermore, it\u2019s a future that\u2019s both bright and approaching at ever-increasing speed.\n\nTo learn more about Honeywell warehouse automation solutions from Kemtek, contact Anthony Shumba at anthonys@kemtek.co.za, call (+27) 011 624 8000 or visit https://kemtek.co.za/prod_brand/honeywell/",

The separation is intended to be completed in the second half of 2026 and in a manner that is tax-free to Honeywell shareholders.\n\n\u201cThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. \u201cOur simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value. We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business as we prepare them to become leading, independent public companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuilding on decades of innovation as its heritage, Honeywell Automation will create the buildings and industrial infrastructure of the future, leveraging process technology, software, and AI-enabled, autonomous solutions to drive the next generation of productivity, sustainability and safety for our customers,\u201d Kapur added. \u201cAs a standalone company with a simplified operating structure and enhanced focus, Honeywell Automation will be better able to capitalize on the global megatrends underpinning its business, from energy security and sustainability to digitalization and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Aerospace prepares for unprecedented demand in the years ahead across both commercial and defense markets, now is the right time for the business to begin its own journey as a standalone, public company,\u201d Kapur continued. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of more than a century of innovation and investment in leading technologies from Honeywell Aerospace that have revolutionized the aviation industry several times over.

            "content": "Honeywell International (HON 0.17%) is finally breaking up. The rationale for the breakup makes perfect sense, and it could release a lot of value for investors. Still, does that make the stock a buy right now? Here's what you need to know before deciding on the stock.\n\nHoneywell's breakup plans\n\nHaving previously announced the spinoff of its advanced materials business (due in late 2025 or early 2026), Honeywell's management decided to take the next step and separate its automation and aerospace businesses in the second half of 2026. As of yet, it's not clear which company will be the \"RemainCo.\"\n\nThe breakup is pretty much along the lines that activist investors have been pushing for. Indeed, Elliott Investment Management pushed for change at Honeywell, arguing that a breakup could lead to a value per share between $321 (base case scenario) and $383 by the end of 2026 -- figures representing a 54% and an 84% increase on the price at the time of writing.\n\nElliott's case rests on believing that Honeywell's businesses would be better run as separate companies than within a conglomerate structure. In addition, Elliott's argument, echoed by many other investors, is that the market would grant the separate businesses higher valuation multiples. The prescription is simple: Break up the company, and the businesses will generate higher earnings, which would be valued more.\n\nIn short, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.\n\nHoneywell management's view\n\nNaturally, Wall Street analysts were interested in asking about the subject, with Morgan Stanley's Chris Snyder inquiring as to the primary driver of the decision. CEO Vimal Kapur argued that it was a strategic decision based on the increasing divergence in the needs of aerospace and automation, with Honeywell Aerospace needing to work on capacity expansion and supply chain transformation and Honeywell Automation needing to focus on artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and energy security.\n\nKapur argued, \"It's primarily driven by our conviction that there's more growth momentum and more value to create as a separate company.\" .\n\nHoneywell's valuation\n\nKapur's argument is fair enough, and it's what you might expect a CEO to say. After all, he's responsible for Honeywell's operational performance and can't control how the market values the stock. This is not to argue that CEOs don't keep a close eye on valuations; after all, generating shareholder value is key, and a stock's valuation does influence its ability to raise capital or sell equity.\n\nMoreover, Honeywell named its \"representative comparable companies\" in its earnings presentation, and when you compare them with Honeywell, there appears to be a compelling case that Honeywell is undervalued.\n\nFirst, here's how Honeywell stacks up against the named comparable aerospace companies in terms of forward enterprise value, or EV (market cap plus net debt), to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nSecond, here's Honeywell with its named comparable automation companies.\n\nIs Honeywell undervalued?\n\nThe answer is yes, but not as much as the charts suggest. For starters, Honeywell Aerospace's 26% segment margin is nowhere near TransDigm's near 53% EBITDA margin. Moreover, GE Aerospace has 74% of its revenue coming from commercial aerospace compared to 60% for Honeywell, and the former has several decades of lucrative aftermarket revenue coming from servicing its engines on commercial narrowbody and widebody planes. The same is true of RTX. Meanwhile, Honeywell Aerospace is more about avionics, propulsion systems, and business jet engines.\n\nTurning to Honeywell Automation, a business that combines industrial and building automation, Rockwell is more of a comparable pure-play automation company, while Emerson Electric has made great strides to become one with investments in industrial software and automated testing and measurement. Johnson Controls is a pure-play building automation, software, and controls company. Honeywell Automation also has its warehouse automation and productivity solutions and services business, which reported 5% and 7% organic sales declines in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nAll told the breakup makes sense, and the sum-of-the-parts argument does apply, but not by as much as many investors might think it will. There are reasons why Honeywell trades at a discount to many of its peers, and it's not just because of the conglomerate structure.\n\nAs such, investors must be patient and hope management can improve earnings over time. Honeywell looks like a decent value, but buying it depends on management's execution rather than the prospect of a valuation expansion resulting from a breakup.",

            "content": "Honeywell, one of the last remaining U.S. industrial conglomerates, will split into three independent companies, following in the footsteps of manufacturing giants like General Electric and Alcoa.\n\nThe company said that it will separate from its automation and aerospace technologies businesses. Including plans announced earlier to spin off its advanced materials business, Honeywell will consist of three smaller entities in hopes that they will each be more agile.\n\n\u201cThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement.\n\nHoneywell said in December it was considering spinning off its aerospace division. The public announcement arrived about one month after Elliott Investment Management revealed a stake of more than $5 billion in the aerospace, automation and materials company. Elliott had been pushing for the Charlotte company to separate its automation and aerospace businesses.\n\nThe board of Honeywell International Inc. had been exploring strategic options for the company since earlier in 2024.\n\nThe company, which makes everything from eye solution to barcode readers, has been seeking ways to make itself nimbler. Over the past year and a half, just after Kapur took over as CEO, Honeywell has announced plans for the advanced materials business spinoff, entered into an agreement to sell its personal protective equipment business and made several acquisitions.\n\nThe separation of the automation and aerospace technologies businesses is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026. The spinoff of the advanced materials business is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year or early next year.\n\nLike Honeywell, other U.S. conglomerates have been pressured by shareholders to simplify their structures, allowing each segment of the company to move more freely and adapt to changes in their respective markets.\n\nIconic CEOs like Jack Welch of General Electric spent years building corporate American behemoths with the belief that with scale came power. Yet those massive companies were forced to compete with upstarts with a narrow focus and a more clearly defined set of goals.\n\nIn 2015, metals maker Alcoa said that it was splitting into two independent companies, separating its bauxite, aluminum and casting operations from its engineering, transportation and global rolled products businesses.\n\nGE announced in 2021 that it was dividing itself into three public companies focused on aviation, health care and energy. At the time, the move was viewed as a potential signal of the end of conglomerates as a whole.",

If that\u2019s the case, then General Electric's NYSE: GE CEO must be blushing after hearing that Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) is adopting a similar strategy by breaking up into separate entities.\n\nHoneywell International Today HON Honeywell International $206.69 +0.34 (+0.16%) 52-Week Range $189.75 \u25bc $242.77 Dividend Yield 2.19% P/E Ratio 23.73 Price Target $249.38 Add to Watchlist Get HON alerts: Sign Up On February 6, 2025, Honeywell announced plans to fully separate its Automation and Aerospace Technologies divisions. This follows its earlier decision to spin off its Advanced Materials unit. However, the push for a full breakup was largely driven by activist investor Elliott Investment Management. The firm took a $5 billion stake in November 2024, pressuring the company to unlock shareholder value. Once the split is complete, which is expected in 2026, investors will hold shares in three distinct business units encompassing aerospace stocks, materials stocks, and technology stocks. Honeywell aims to create stronger, more focused businesses that can grow independently. This mirrors GE\u2019s approach when it announced its own breakup in 2021. That restructuring resulted in three separate companies: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. NYSE: GEHC, and GE Vernova NYSE: GEV, which oversees its renewable energy operations. Remove Ads\n\nTraders Sell, Analysts Indicate Caution\n\nHON stock fell roughly 6% on the news, extending its losses in 2025 and pushing the stock below its 250-day simple moving average. From a technical standpoint, the stock appears oversold at these levels. However, the drop was primarily linked to the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report. While Honeywell delivered strong headline numbers, a deeper look at the results suggests another reason for the split. The company reported earnings per share of $2.47, which was higher than the $2.37 analysts expected. Revenue came in at $10.09 billion, beating estimates of $9.83 billion. Despite these strong numbers, most of the company\u2019s growth in 2024 came from the aerospace division, while other segments struggled. The separation could allow the aerospace unit to grow without being weighed down by slower-performing divisions. Honeywell International MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 91st Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 20.7% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -2.57 News Sentiment 1.38 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 9.57% See Full Analysis This raises questions about the near-term outlook for HON stock. The full breakup will not be completed until 2026. The Basic Materials spinoff is expected in 2025, but investors who buy in now will need a long-term perspective to benefit from the restructuring. That means looking at Honeywell\u2019s forward guidance, which was cautious and may hint at the rationale behind the split. Management and activist investors may see the conglomerate as too complex to manage effectively as a single entity. For income-focused investors, Honeywell\u2019s dividend yield of 2.18% and annual payout of $4.52 per share may provide a reason to hold onto shares. Analysts currently rate the stock a Moderate Buy with a consensus price target of $248.71, representing a 19% upside. However, several analysts have lowered their price targets since the earnings report, with some falling below the consensus. What\u2019s Old Is New Again\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Honeywell\u2019s breakup will achieve its intended goals. However, the decision to spin off its aerospace division follows a pattern seen with companies like GE and Lockheed Martin, which have restructured in recent years. This marks a shift from the decades-long trend of consolidation in the aerospace industry. Many of the same companies that once sought diversification now see greater value in a more focused approach. For GE, the strategy has paid off. Its stock is up 47% in the past 12 months and 23% in 2025 as of February 11. Honeywell is hoping for similar success. However, investors will be watching closely to see if the move truly unlocks more value or simply reshuffles the company\u2019s existing challenges.\n\nBefore you consider Honeywell International, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

The exchange-traded fund has gained 17.6% over the past 52 weeks and 4.6% on a YTD basis.\n\nHoneywell's shares dropped 5.6% following its Q4 earnings release on Feb. 6.

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in 2023, the U.S. manufacturing sector contributed approximately $2.3 trillion to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 10.2% of the total U.S. GDP. Additionally, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that as of January 2025, the manufacturing sector employs approximately 12.76 million individuals.\n\nReshoring and Strategic Shifts:\n\nIn recent years, the sector has experienced notable trends that are reshaping its landscape. One prominent development is the movement towards reshoring\u2014the practice of bringing manufacturing operations back to the United States. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, ongoing trade frictions with China, and the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reconsider the risks of offshoring. The decline in China\u2019s factory activity and the country\u2019s economic slowdown have also contributed to this shift, as firms seek to reduce their dependency on a single manufacturing hub. In fact, according to a report by CNBC, mentions of \u201creshoring\u201d in the broader market\u2019s earnings transcripts surged by 128% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year, outpacing even the rise in discussions about artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Trends:\n\nManufacturing stocks have shown resilience over the past year. Despite challenges like inflation and shifting interest rates, the sector has benefited from strong domestic demand and strategic investments in technology. In 2024, greater asset price dispersion across securities, sectors, and countries created strong alpha opportunities for hedge funds. This market dynamic coincided with a significant increase in corporate profits within the U.S. manufacturing sector, which experienced a five-year compound annual growth rate of 11.1%, as reported by NIST.\n\nOutlook and Future Growth Prospects:\n\nThe outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector is cautiously optimistic. Despite ongoing challenges, a focus on innovation and supportive policies position the sector for steady growth. According to a report by Reuters, in January 2025, manufacturing expanded for the first time since 2022, with the ISM manufacturing PMI rising to 50.9\u2014the highest reading since September 2022. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best manufacturing stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. Our focus was on selecting manufacturing companies across various sub-sectors within the industry, including industrial equipment, automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. From this pool of companies, we identified the 10 best manufacturing stocks and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a global powerhouse in diversified technology and manufacturing.

Its broad product portfolio and global footprint make Honeywell a stalwart in the industrial sector.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) announced plans to split into three independent companies, focusing on automation, aerospace, and advanced materials. This strategic move aims to unlock shareholder value by allowing each entity to pursue tailored growth strategies. The separations are expected to be completed by the second half of 2026. HON is one of the best manufacturing stocks.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) reported revenues of $10.1 billion, a 6.9% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, surpassing analyst expectations.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase upgraded Honeywell International Inc.

            "content": "Even in a volatile market inundated with the latest policy changes, one corporate event last week highlighted a growing trend that may help investors through the rest of the year. Lennar last week completed its spinoff of Millrose Properties , siphoning off its land banking assets into a real estate investment trust that will now acquire and develop land for Lennar and other homebuilders. The move kicks off the spinoff calendar for 2025, a year that many expect will see more companies splitting off businesses that investors hope will unlock greater value for shareholders. At least 10 spinoffs are set to close through December. \"The calendar is starting to fill up with opportunities,\" said Brian Leonard, a small-cap and midcap portfolio manager at Keeley Teton. He said he will be monitoring the transactions for potential investments. Some spinoffs to be completed this year include Honeywell , which last week said it is splitting into three independently listed companies by the end of 2025 or early next year. Last November, Comcast said it plans to create a new company for its cable network businesses, including USA Network and CNBC, in a spinoff set to be completed by year's end. 'A coiled up spring' There are more spinoffs expected this year, partly because interest rates have finally eased off their highs, and because companies \u2014 with shareholders seeking earnings growth in an expensive market \u2014 are reviewing their businesses in hopes that the sum of their parts may be greater than the whole. \"The real focus is on companies' ability to manufacture growth and how they're going to continue to move 'the ball down the football field.' How they keep on moving forward,\" said Leonard. \"Oftentimes, that results in some sort of corporate action.\" Spinoffs, mergers and acquisitions and restructurings are a \"coiled up spring\" set to break out from a two-year low, with plenty of money ready to be deployed from the sidelines, said Thorne Perkin, president of Papamarkou Wellner Perkin. The money manager told CNBC that he spends his days speaking with investors at family offices and institutional funds who are sitting on \"20%, 30%, 40%, 50%\" in cash, and who have been reluctant to sell companies into a weak market with high interest rates. \"There's plenty of capital out there. It's just been on the sidelines,\" Perkin said. \"It's a lot of people sitting on their hands.\" Why spinoffs? For investors, it is a unique opportunity to invest in spinoffs, as the separate businesses are likely more focused and agile, potentially unlocking their full potential. What's more, spun-off companies typically outperform their parent companies for the first 400 trading days after the close date, according to Trivariate Research. On average, over the next 18 to 24 months, the spinoffs outpace the S & P 500 by an average of 10%, the firm said. Additionally, spinoffs in businesses different from their parent companies perform better than those spun off into the same industries. However, there are risks. Spun-off companies typically experience more near-term volatility, especially as funds sell shares in new businesses that do not meet their investment criteria. However, the short-term dip could be an opportunity for a quick-eyed investor to snag a bargain. For example, Keeley Teton's Leonard said he would wait and see what happens with Millrose Properties, the company spun off from Lennar. In the first trading week following the spinoff, shares of Lennar rose 2%, while Millrose Properties plunged 15%. \"It's kind of the first one of many we're looking at, at least about 10 to 14 additional businesses this year,\" Leonard said. \"Lennar's going to lead the pack coming out first.\" \u2014 CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.",

Barclays adjusted its price target due to a sum-of-the-parts valuation, finding substantial share upside despite recent challenges. Meanwhile, RBC Capital lowered its target, citing the unexpectedly weak 2025 guidance that overshadowed potential benefits from the company\u2019s strategic separation into three entities. Baird also reduced its target, noting the stock\u2019s stagnation amid the breakup plan. Wells Fargo attributed its lowered target to conservative guidance, with a focus on aero growth and margins as potential upside areas. These changes reflect a mix of strategic optimism and immediate financial pressures, including challenges from macroeconomic conditions and segment margin pressures, despite Honeywell\u2019s strong backlog and strategic initiatives such as the Bombardier agreement.\n\nMore about Honeywell International\n\nYTD Price Performance: -7.54%\n\nAverage Trading Volume: 4,110,095\n\nTechnical Sentiment Consensus Rating: Sell\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $133.6B\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Honeywell (NYSE: HON) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $10.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.47 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $9.9 billion and $2.32, respectively. The company benefited from strong building automation sales. However, Honeywell\u2019s outlook for 2025 fell short of expectations. Honeywell has announced plans to reorganize into three separate companies: Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and Advanced Materials. This restructuring decision follows activist investor Elliott Management\u2019s push for change at the company.\n\nHON stock, with 2% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. A weakness in safety and productivity solutions segment lately has put downward pressure on the company\u2019s stock performance. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s revenue of $10.1 billion in Q4 was up 7% y-o-y, led by Aerospace Technologies, up 9%. Looking at other segments, Building Automation sales were up 20% and Energy & Sustainability Solutions revenue saw a 4% rise. However, Industrial Automation sales were down 1%, due to continued softness in the safety and sensing technologies business. Honeywell\u2019s segment profit margin of 20.9% in Q4\u201924 declined by 350 bps y-o-y. This resulted in the bottom line of $2.47, down 8% y-o-y. Looking forward, Honeywell expects its full-year 2025 sales to be in the range of $39.6 billion to $40.6 billion, and its adjusted earnings to be in the range of $10.10 and $10.50, falling short of the consensus estimate of $10.91.\n\nA bleak outlook didn\u2019t sit well with the investors, and HON stock dropped 6% post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the performance of HON stock with respect to the index over the recent years has been quite volatile.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could HON face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model to reflect the latest results, HON stock seems to be undervalued. At its current levels of around $210, it\u2019s trading at 21x trailing earnings of $9.89 per share, versus the stock\u2019s average P/E ratio of 25x. We believe that the current valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking robust long-term returns in HON stock.\n\nWhile HON stock appears to have some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Honeywell\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

The company expects to finalize the separation of its automation and aerospace divisions in the latter half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals, while the advanced materials spinoff is set for late 2025 or 2026.\n\nHoneywell's operations span over a diversified portfolio, with the company classifying their activities into these segments: industrial automation, aerospace technologies and energy transition solutions.\n\n\u201cThe creation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on our strong foundation, allowing each to implement tailored growth strategies and unlock value for shareholders and customers,\u201d Kapur stated. He also emphasized Honeywell\u2019s commitment to portfolio simplification and strategic acquisitions to strengthen each new entity ahead of their public launches.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s aerospace division, which includes its defense operations, will become Honeywell Aerospace, generating $15 billion in revenue in 2024. The unit specializes in aviation technologies such as engines, avionics, and cockpit and navigation systems.\n\nThe decision follows a strategic portfolio review by Honeywell\u2019s board and mirrors General Electric\u2019s recent split into three separate businesses, including GE Aerospace, which now houses its defense engine operations.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s aerospace division saw a 14 percent increase in defense and space sales in Q4 2024, driven by strong global demand and supply chain improvements. The company reported $4.9 billion in defense-related revenue in 2023, accounting for approximately 14 percent of its total revenue, according to Defense News\u2019 2024 ranking of the top 100 defense firms.\n\nBy Nazrin Sadigova",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Why Are These 10 Dividend Stocks Declining? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other declining dividend stocks.\n\nThe dividend season is here, and the big announcements are rolling in!\n\nThe overall market atmosphere has been moderately negative since the new tariffs from the US. Soon after he entered the Oval Office, President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico. Chinese products, meanwhile, are left tackling an even higher tariff of 60 percent.\n\nAs a result, on Monday this week, the broader market noted a sharp decline of 0.76 percent, while the Nasdaq reported the same trajectory but at 1.20 percent.\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently shown interest in dividend stocks, particularly those from companies that have steadily increased their payouts, making them popular among income-focused investors. Analysts have long tracked the performance of Dividend Aristocrats, both historically and in recent times.\n\nIn a January 2019 blog post titled \u201cDividend Growth Strategies and Downside Protection,\u201d Phillip Brzenk, Global Head of Multi-Asset Indexes, examined how dividend growth strategies perform, especially during market downturns. He noted that since the end of 1989, there have been six calendar years where the broader market delivered negative returns. Interestingly, during each of those years, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader equity benchmark by an average margin of 13.28%. In addition, in three of those challenging years, they still managed to generate positive total returns. Brzenk further pointed out that when analyzed on a monthly basis, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the market 53% of the time, with an average outperformance of 0.16%.\n\nAs noted earlier, dividend growth stocks have outperformed the broader market. From its launch in 2005 through September 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered a total return of 10.35%, exceeding the broader market\u2019s 9.54% return over the same period. Moreover, these stocks experienced lower volatility, measured at 15.35%, compared to the market\u2019s 16.31%. This suggests that their prices tend to be more stable, making them less susceptible to sharp fluctuations and highlighting their overall resilience.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn the list of underwhelming performers we will be looking into today, the dividend companies with a minimum of $1 billion in market capitalization alone are considered. Then we checked the returns of these stocks and selected 10 stocks that fell on February 6, 2024. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as of February 6. We also hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 2.15%\n\nEx-Dividend Date: February 28, 2025\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds: 55\n\nQuarterly dividend amount: $1.13\n\nOn 6th Feb, the stock of Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) opened at $215 at NYSE, a 13% decline from its all-time high after they announced a strategic split into three independent entities. Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell, said the following regarding the company\u2019s performance:\n\n\u201cThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers.\u201d\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) joins other industrial giants like 3M, General Electric, and United Technologies in breaking up large conglomerates as it announced it would break up into three independently listed entities\u2014Aerospace, Automation, and Advanced Material following activist investor Elliott Management\u2019s $5 billion stake in the company. Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg and Managing Partner Jesse Cohn said:\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s action, Honeywell will be separating its Automation and Aerospace businesses into two market-leading enterprises poised for sustained growth and value creation.\u201d\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)\u2019s shares have been on a steep decline since the news broke out. As per our database, 55 hedge fund portfolios held Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) at the end of the third quarter. Honeywell is one of the stocks on the radar of dividend investors as it pays a 2.16% dividend yield, and it could change as the company opts for different capital structures, cash flows, and pay-out policies.\n\nOverall, HON ranks 10th on our list of declining dividend stocks. While we acknowledge the potential for HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Honeywell\u2019s stock has dropped 13% due to market volatility and restructuring concerns.\n\nThe company plans to split into three independent firms: Aerospace, Automation, and Advanced Materials.\n\nInvestors are worried about the impact of this split on Honeywell\u2019s dividend, currently at a yield of 2.15%.\n\nNegative sentiment around trade tariffs is affecting not only Honeywell but also many dividend-paying stocks.\n\nRestructuring efforts, influenced by activist investors, could either unlock value or create instability.\n\nHistorically, strong dividend growth has helped companies weather market downturns.\n\nAlternative investment opportunities in sectors like AI could be more attractive during uncertain times.\n\nIn a turbulent market where uncertainty looms large, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ: HON) has recently captured headlines for its dramatic stock decline, plummeting 13% from its peak. With the announcement of a radical split into three independent firms\u2014Aerospace, Automation, and Advanced Materials\u2014questions about the future loom over its dividend prospects, including a current yield of 2.15%.\n\nAs the market grapples with tariffs and economic fluctuations, Honeywell isn\u2019t alone in this downward spiral. The latest market turbulence, triggered largely by negative sentiments towards new trade tariffs, has seen widespread declines among dividend-paying stocks. Investors typically flock to these stocks for their steady income, particularly during market downturns. Yet, Honeywell\u2019s restructuring plan, reportedly influenced by activist investors, has raised eyebrows and cast doubt on its stability.\n\nThe split is a departure from traditional company structures, aiming to unlock new growth strategies and shareholder value. However, with over 55 hedge funds holding its stock, analysts are keenly observing how this transition affects returns. Historically, companies with strong dividend growth have outperformed during tough times, showing resilience amidst market chaos. Honeywell\u2019s future, intertwined with this split, poses a gamble for income-focused investors.\n\nFor those looking for alternatives, other potential investments in the AI sector may offer remarkable returns without the complexity of corporate restructuring. In a world full of uncertainty, staying informed and agile is the best strategy for investors. Keep an eye on Honeywell as it navigates this transformative phase!\n\nThe Future of Honeywell: Will the Split Revitalize or Ruin Its Dividend Appeal?\n\nHoneywell International Inc.: A Closer Look at Recent Developments\n\nIn the wake of Honeywell International Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ: HON) recent decision to split into three independent firms\u2014Aerospace, Automation, and Advanced Materials\u2014investors are analyzing both the risks and rewards associated with this bold restructuring.

Price reversed course and rallied to the high at 92.725. It consolidated the rest of the session to settle at 92.15. The early breakdown stalled just a tick above the January 28th high and the high penetrated resistance at 92.375 but was unable to takeout the January 30th high at 92.75. Settlement was below resistance and the inability to sustain resistance reinforces this level as a strong resistance point, in my opinion. The session formed a small bodied candle indicating indecision in the price action at this key level. The cash market has strengthened with both the Lean Hog Index and Pork Cutout Index working higher as demand is strong and slaughter levels have been declining, indicating lower supplies of hogs. Exports exploded on the last report on Thursday, reaching 50,700 MT as Mexico bought 21,700 MT in front of expected tariffs, which were to start on February 1st. It will be interesting to see if sales are cancelled as the tariff implementation was delayed to March, if it occurs at all. The decline in slaughter is seasonal and also indicates that the USDA may have overstated supply in their last Hogs and Pigs report. With slaughter levels declining and expected to stay on the lower end compared to last year, the retail industry has been fairly aggressive in purchasing pork as it gears up for the later than usual Easter Holiday. Cash is anticipated to continue higher as evidenced by the strength in the expiring(2/14/2025) February contract which settled at 87.25, a little over 2 handles above the index. We\u2019ll see!... A breakdown from settlement could see price test the Friday low and then possibly move towards support at the rising 8-DMA now at 90.60 and the nearby 90.40 support level. Hogs have a gap from the February 5th low at 89.975 to the February 4th high at 89.90. Support then comes in at the rising 13-DMA now at 89.80. A rally past resistance at 92.375 could re-test the January 30th high. A rally past here could see price move towards resistance at 93.50.\n\nThe Pork Cutout Index increased and is 94.47 as of 02/06/2025.\n\nThe Lean Hog Index increased and is at 85.05 as of 02/05/2025.\n\nEstimated Slaughter for Friday is 489,000, which is above last week\u2019s 480,000 and last year\u2019s 481,690. Saturday slaughter is expected to be 102,000, which is below last week\u2019s 156,000 and last year\u2019s 182,965. The estimated total for the week (so far) is 2,536,000, which is below last week\u2019s 2,569,000 and last year\u2019s 2,623,899.\n\nMarch Feeder Cattle drifted in the lower end of Thursday\u2019s large breakdown candle trading above support at the rising 50-DMA now at 264.50 and the key level at 264.675. The Friday range was small, with the high at 266.15 and the low at 264.45. Settlement was near the low at 264.90. Friday\u2019s low was the second day in a row of testing these two strong support levels that was successful in slowing down the decline in the future\u2019s price. The session formed a weak Bullish Harami candlestick pattern which could lead to a retracement higher if support holds once again. This potential retracement could provide bearish traders with an opportunity as the weekly chart put in a bearish formation called an Evening Star Candlestick pattern. A retracement to the middle to upper middle of the week\u2019s breakdown is possible, in my opinion. The Feeder Cattle index (see below) has broken down after peaking at its all-time high price at 281.68, following the future\u2019s downward progression. A breakdown from settlement could see price retest support at the key level and the rising 50-DMA. Support then comes in at 262.075. A rally pat the Friday high could take price higher and test resistance at 266.975 and then 267.775. We\u2019ll see!...\n\nThe Feeder Cattle Index fell and is at 275.59 as of 02/06/2025.\n\nApril Live Cattle traded in the lower end of Thursday\u2019s breakdown candle in a quiet session to end the week at the low end of its recent trading range. Friday\u2019s range was 197.70 for the high and 196.30 for the low. Settlement was near the low at 196.775. Price traded around support at 196.625 with it holding with settlement just above it. The breakdown in the futures took cash cattle prices lower as the week progressed. Last week saw cash prices make a new all-time high average price at 209.57 and the weakness in futures pressured cash prices this week. Last week\u2019s high could be the near-term top in the cash market as we could be heading into a seasonal down-turn with packers cutting back on slaughter and the cutout price falling and expected to drop some more, in my opinion. Consumer demand usually weakens, and packers announce cooler cleanings and what not to justify slaughter cutbacks and a backing off in their pricing of cattle for purchase, in my opinion. We have a late Easter holiday, and this could also affect beef demand from consumers and therefore the retailer pursuit of beef further limiting the cutout price. The decline in futures prices this week gives the packing industry hope that they will regain control of the cash market as fund long positions are coming under pressure after taking record positions in the cattle markets, in my opinion. The weekly chart put in an Evening Star candle pattern after making an all-time high in the lead contract based on volume. It also tested support at the rising 8-WMA at 196.375 as it held with settlement just above it. We could see a retracement if price can hold this level as we established a Bullish Harami on the daily chart on Friday. This could provide bearish traders with an opportunity if a rally to resistance occurs. Watch for stops if support fails next week. We\u2019ll see!... If price can\u2019t hold support, a breakdown could lead to a test of support at the rising50-DMA now at 194.125 and the nearby key level at 193.95. Support then comes in at 193.225 and then 192.70. If price can overcome the Friday high, we could see price test resistance at 199.10. Resistance then comes in at 200.90.\n\nBoxed beef cutouts were lower as choice cutouts fell 2.11 to 321.87 and select decreased 1.87 to 312.90. The choice/ select spread narrowed and is at 8.97 and the load count was 155.\n\nFriday\u2019s estimated slaughter is 100,000, which is below last week\u2019s 114,000 and last year\u2019s 116,407. Saturday slaughter is expected to be 8,000, which is above last week\u2019s 2,000 and last year\u2019s 3,967. The estimated total for the week(so far) is 584,000, which is below last week\u2019s 600,000 and last year\u2019s 617,013.\n\nThe USDA report LM_Ct131 states: So far for Friday, negotiated cash trade has been mostly inactive on very light demand in all regions. The last reported market in all regions was Thursday. In the Southern Plains, live FOB purchases traded at 206.00. In Nebraska, live FOB and dressed delivered purchases traded at 208.00 and 328.00, respectively. In the Western Cornbelt, live FOB purchases traded from 205.00-208.00 and dressed delivered traded at 328.00.\n\nThe USDA is indicating cash trades for live cattle from 203.00 \u2013 209.00 and from 320.00 \u2013 333.00 on a dressed basis (so far).\n\n**Call me for a free consultation for a marketing plan regarding your livestock needs.**\n\nBen DiCostanzo\n\nSenior Market Strategist\n\nWalsh Trading, Inc.\n\nDirect: 312.957.4163\n\n888.391.7894\n\nFax: 312.256.0109\n\nbdicostanzo@walshtrading.com\n\nwww.walshtrading.com\n\nWalsh Trading, Inc. is registered as a Guaranteed Introducing Broker with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and an NFA Member.\u200b\n\nFutures and options trading involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & President Trump. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street saw him continue to comment on the semiconductor industry. While chip stocks, primarily those geared towards data center AI computing, were the biggest winners of the AI revolution, things took a sharp turn last month following the DeepSeek selloff. Now, investors are continuously wondering whether the billions of dollars earmarked for data centers will actually materialize.\n\nHowever, while the selloff occurred in 2025, Cramer\u2019s co-host Carl Quintanilla pointed out that chip stocks were range bound since the latter half of 2024. In response, Cramer shared that investing in these stocks had \u201cbeen very very difficult, because frankly, they\u2019re one of the segments that you don\u2019t want to be in.\u201d This is because he believes that \u201cThere seems like there\u2019s too much competition\u201d amongst the companies. This includes the firm responsible for the Snapdragon processors \u201cgoing against\u201d the British design house owned by Softbank. Other examples shared by Cramer include the design house going against Dr. Lisa Su\u2019s chip company and America\u2019s largest and only integrated chip maker simply \u201cflailing,\u201d with Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock lately coming \u201cunder attack.\u201d\n\nThis turmoil leads the CNBC host to conclude that \u201cyou\u2019ve got a group David, that is frankly verklempt is the word I was searching for.\u201d\n\nCramer also commented on research papers and industry participants pointing at the continually dropping AI training costs. Commenting specifically on a Stanford paper saying researchers training a cloud model for 5o bucks, he sardonically remarked \u201cI think by the end these guys are going to make it so that, they pay you to take it. I mean there\u2019s a little absurdity going on here.\u201d\n\nAnother topic he discussed in quite detail during the show was the auto industry. Elon Musk\u2019s car company and the firm that makes the F-150 truck fell as trading opened on the back of factors such as weaker demand in Europe and auto demand in America. Cramer believes that the latter firm\u2019s CEO \u201cJim Farley is a great spokesman for the auto industry. He just said look, it\u2019s a disaster what it is. Obviously, it\u2019s going to hurt them.\u201d Discussing President Trump\u2019s sanctions against Mexico, Cramer pointed out that they would be particularly painful for Farley\u2019s company due to its Mexican production base. Cramer added that a new direction in the tariff debate might see the President take aim on Japan and South Korea.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201cHe [Farley] did. . .at one point say and I thought it was very important for the American people, said, we are having this conversation, well Honda is importing six hundred thousand units in the US with no incremental tariff. Why is Toyota able to import point five million vehicles in the US with no incremental tariff? I mean there are millions of vehicles coming into this country that are not being applied. Now I think that\u2019s what I would go to the President and say.\u201d\n\nCramer also shared his take on Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum. \u201cClaudia Scheinbaum\u2019s ratings, I was looking at hers yesterday, the President of Mexico,\u201d he shared. \u201cThrough the roof, in the eighties. Because they feel that she offered a credible solution, which is to sit down and talk with the President,\u201d he added.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 6th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 55\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is one of the largest American industrial conglomerates. Its shares gained a mere 9.4% in 2024 and were up primarily due to the November election proving to be a boon for industrial companies. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) has been beset by a slowdown in its automation business and an overall sluggish environment. The firm\u2019s narrative is driven by activist Elliot Management taking a stake and driving change. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) announced that it was splitting into three businesses, and here\u2019s what Cramer said about the affair:\n\n\u201cBut this is the quarter you have to buy because you\u2019re finally getting the three pieces. The aerospace business is fantastic. This chemicals business is of course a little bit better than the GDP. And then you have this automation business which has been a disappointment.\u201d \u201cFor aerospace, they have the cockpit. They have a lot of intellectual property in a plane. They have obviously some service, I think that you do want to emulate. Now remember they\u2019re in every plane. They\u2019re in Bombardier, Airbus, they\u2019re in Boeing. They\u2019ve got a hammerlock on the group. Dave Cote put that together and I like that business. You may just say, hold your nose and buy. If you get that business.\u201d \u201cThat factory automation, David the warehouse business, that was bad. That was bad. . . That\u2019s been a loser.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m totally with you. Which is why my trust owns it. We\u2019ve been selling higher. Now I\u2019m going to buy it back or hold on.\u201d\n\nOverall, HON ranks first on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The move comes after activist investor group Elliott Management revealed a $5 billion stake in the conglomerate, which makes everything from air purifiers to airplane parts to materials for bullet-proof vests.\n\nOne of the companies set to come out of the Honeywell break-up will focus on aerospace equipment. And there\u2019s an element of deja vu to all this.\n\nBack in 2022, another conglomerate went through a break up. GE spun off its aerospace division \u2014 which shot straight to the moon, according to Jarrad Harford, a finance professor at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cGE Aerospace now as a standalone is actually worth more than the combined entity was at the time of the spinoff,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking up a big conglomerate that does lots of different things \u201cgives investors the ability to buy the thing they want without it being bundled to this other stuff,\u201d Harford said.\n\nAnd one thing investors want is airplane parts, said Richard Safran, an aerospace analyst at Seaport Research Partners \u2014 \u201cbecause the world is growing and more people are flying.\u201d\n\nAirbus and Boeing are working to fill a huge backlog of new plane orders, Safran said. That\u2019s a golden opportunity for Honeywell, which supplies engine systems and cockpit displays. Meanwhile, as airlines wait for their new planes to arrive, they\u2019ve gotta keep the old ones up and running for longer.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do the maintenance on your car, shame on you. But if you don\u2019t do the maintenance on an airplane, you go to jail, right? It\u2019s mandatory,\u201d Safran said.\n\nAll that maintenance means replacement parts \u2014 more potential business for Honeywell aerospace, business that GE Aerospace is already benefiting from. Plus, Safran said the company could be in line for a payday from the military.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also \u2014 because of Trump 2.0, I think \u2014 on the verge of a major modernization effort in defense,\u201d he said.\n\nAll together, between the public and private sector, the shortage of planes and plane parts isn\u2019t a new problem, per aviation consultant Robert Mann.\n\n\u201cThis is a system that has not really recovered from the pandemic era,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the supply chain interruptions have been, unfortunately, very difficult to solve.\u201d\n\nBut the shortage could bode well for Honeywell as it looks to replicate the success of GE Aerospace.\n\n\u201cUltimately, air travel demand is very strong and far exceeds the ability of manufacturers to produce and airlines to operate equipment,\u201d Mann said.\n\nThat, he added, means companies that can reliably make airplane parts should prepare for takeoff in the coming years.",

            "content": "Insider Brief\n\nHoneywell announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies\u2014Automation, Aerospace, and Advanced Materials\u2014by 2026, restructuring one of the last major U.S. industrial conglomerates.\n\nCEO Vimal Kapur confirmed a desire to monetize its stake in Quantinuum, Honeywell\u2019s quantum computing subsidiary, but emphasized the decision would wait on optimal timing.\n\nActivist investor Elliott Management, which pushed for the break-up, believes the restructuring could increase Honeywell\u2019s valuation by up to 75% over the next two years.\n\nHoneywell yesterday announced that it will be split into three separate companies \u2013 each of them will be publicly listed \u2014 with the completion of the restructuring of one of the United States last remaining industrial conglomerates slated for 2026.\n\nAccording to documents that have been filed with the SEC and also in direct statements by Vimal Kapoor the CEO, Honeywell shareholders will end up with three separate companies. One that contains the current aerospace division, one that contains the current advanced materials division, and a remaining entity that will own the other activities \u2013 including Honeywell\u2019s interest in Quantinuum.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Vimal suggested there are lots of options for Quantinuum but did not comment on whether the automation entity will effectively be a public listing of what many consider to be a world leader in quantum computing company.\n\nWhile the restructuring is focused on Honeywell\u2019s historic core businesses \u2014 automation, aerospace, and advanced materials \u2013 it\u2019s also confirms the growing importance of Quantinuum to Honeywell\u2019s shareholders.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer asked Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur during the interview if the company was interested in monetizing Quantinuum, adding that the quantum company could be \u201cmore valuable than aerospace.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuantinuum is a real company \u2014 I know you\u2019re going to do something with it \u2014 why not just sell it for $25 billion to the public?\u201d Cramer asked.\n\n\u201cI would love to monetize our stake in Quantinuum as early as possible,\u201d Kapur told Cramer. \u201cThe good news, Jim, is that we are making all the technical progress we have committed. We are hitting all the milestones. We recently announced a partnership with Softbank.\u201d\n\nHe added that the company is positioning itself for further growth and more fundraising.\n\n\u201cWe did a fundraise about a year back, pre-money, and we were valued at $5 billion,\u201d Kapur said. \u201cThat was almost a year back. We are going to do, again, more money raising in the next few months. The market is really not ready for a true IPO, the market needs more evidence of commercial success. We will demonstrate that.\u201d\n\nQuantinuum, created in 2021 through the effective merger of US based Honeywell Quantum Solutions and UK based Cambridge Quantum, that was founded by Ilyas Khan, who serves as Quantinuum\u2019s Chief Product Office, is considered one of the world\u2019s leading integrated quantum companies and a pioneer in quantum computers and advanced software solutions. Quantinuum recently announced research milestones, including a significant advance for logical qubits with partner Microsoft and the launching of a generative quantum artificial (AI) intelligence framework.\n\nHoneywell has a majority ownership in Quantinuum having invested over $500 million since 2021 alone, while also bringing in outside investors, including JPMorgan Chase, Mitsui and Amgen. These investors joined IBM and JSR (the Japanese Govt owned Semiconductor company). The company also announced a partnership with SoftBank this week.\n\nThree Independent, Publicly Traded Companies\n\nHoneywell\u2019s recent move creates three independent, publicly traded companies: Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and Honeywell Advanced Materials. The goal, according to the company, is to sharpen each business\u2019s strategic focus and allow for more tailored capital allocation.\n\n\u201cThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d said Kapur, in a company news release. \u201cOur simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value. We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business as we prepare them to become leading, independent public companies.\u201d\n\nThe spin-offs will have major implications for Honeywell\u2019s core business segments. Honeywell Automation will concentrate on industrial software, AI-driven process control, and smart infrastructure, while Honeywell Aerospace will continue supplying propulsion and avionics systems to commercial and defense markets. Advanced Materials, meanwhile, will focus on sustainability-driven chemical and specialty material solutions.\n\nHoneywell Automation\n\nHoneywell Automation would be positioned to develop next-generation industrial infrastructure using advanced process technology, software, and AI-driven automation. CEO Vimal Kapur said the newly independent company will have a streamlined structure, allowing it to focus on key global trends such as energy security, sustainability, digitalization, and AI.\n\n\u201cBuilding on decades of innovation as its heritage, Honeywell Automation will create the buildings and industrial infrastructure of the future, leveraging process technology, software, and AI-enabled, autonomous solutions to drive the next generation of productivity, sustainability and safety for our customers,\u201d Kapur added in the release. \u201cAs a standalone company with a simplified operating structure and enhanced focus, Honeywell Automation will be better able to capitalize on the global megatrends underpinning its business, from energy security and sustainability to digitalization and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nWhat has become increasingly clear is that a very significant part of the value of Automation is Honeywell\u2019s ownership of Quantinuum. This value was brought into focus by Cramer of CNBC who stated that Quantinuum will become larger even than Aerospace, which is currently estimated by analysts to be worth $90 billion to $120 billion approximately.\n\nHoneywell Aerospace\n\nHoneywell Aerospace is set to become an independent public company, a move CEO Vimal Kapur says aligns with growing demand in commercial and defense aviation. He emphasized that the decision builds on over a century of technological advancements that have shaped the industry and will position the company to drive future innovation.\n\n\u201cAs Aerospace prepares for unprecedented demand in the years ahead across both commercial and defense markets, now is the right time for the business to begin its own journey as a standalone, public company,\u201d Kapur continued. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of more than a century of innovation and investment in leading technologies from Honeywell Aerospace that have revolutionized the aviation industry several times over. This next step will further enable the business to continue to lead the future of aviation.\u201d\n\nAdvanced Materials\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Advanced Materials division, soon to operate as an independent company, will focus on sustainability-driven specialty chemicals and materials. The business holds leading positions in fluorine products, electronic materials, industrial-grade fibers, and healthcare packaging, generating nearly $4 billion in revenue last year. It will continue to develop technologies such as its low-global-warming Solstice\u00ae hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) products. With a large domestic manufacturing base, the standalone company aims to attract investors with a streamlined capital allocation strategy and growth potential.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s latest restructuring effort follows a broader trend among industrial giants seeking to optimize operations. In the past year, the company has announced $9 billion worth of acquisitions, including Carrier Global\u2019s Access Solutions business, Civitanavi Systems, and CAES Systems. It is also divesting its Personal Protective Equipment business, set to close in 2025.\n\nFor shareholders, the spin-off strategy will provide an opportunity to invest in more focused businesses, according to investors who spearheaded the move.\n\nLast fall, Elliott Management, an activist investment group, took a $5 billion-plus stake in Honeywell and pushed for a company break-up, stating that Honeywell\u2019s conglomerate model is no longer effective. In a letter Tuesday, they argued that splitting the company into two could increase its value by up to 75% over the next two years.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s action, Honeywell will be separating its Automation and Aerospace businesses into two market-leading enterprises poised for sustained growth and value creation,\u201d said Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg and Managing Partner Jesse Cohn in the statement. \u201cThe enhanced focus, alignment, and strategic agility enabled by this separation will allow Honeywell to realize the opportunity for operational improvement and valuation upside. We look forward to continuing to support Vimal and the management team as they execute on the separation and deliver significant long-term value to Honeywell\u2019s shareholders.\u201d\n\nHoneywell expects the separations of Automation and Aerospace to be completed in the second half of 2026, while the Advanced Materials spin-off is scheduled for the end of 2025 or early 2026.\n\nThe Quantum Insider contacted Quantinuum\u2019s other major shareholder, Ilyas Khan, who controls CQH, the entity that owns close to 40% of Quantinuum. Khan\u2019s beneficial ownership of Quantinuum is reported to be approximately 20%.\n\nKhan said: \u201cI cannot comment on Honeywell\u2019s decisions on their restructuring other than to continue to wish Vimal and his team the best. I will say however that Honeywell as a shareholder, Honeywell as a business partner, and Honeywell as a passionate proponent of quantum as a true industrial revolution and not merely another disruptive technology has been steadfast. We are lucky to have Honeywell as our majority shareholder and I support Vimal\u2019s views that at the appropriate time, when Quantinuum is listed, it will be an extremely valuable company for all shareholders. It is easy to forget amongst all the noise that Honeywell have quietly and patiently supported quantum computing for almost a decade now.\u201d",

In addition, Honeywell has an energy and sustainability solutions business.\n\nThe move has been instigated by activist fund Elliott Management. This investment firm purchased $5 billion worth of Honeywell stock back in November 2024 with the declared purpose of pushing for a break-up of the company.\n\nAt the time of the share purchase, Elliott Management stated that it considered Honeywell\u2019s performance to be suffering from an over-complex structure and poor management, which had led the stock to underperform compared to its industry peers.\n\nHoneywell is a major player in the aerospace sector. Its aviation division, called Honeywell Aerospace Technologies, develops and manufactures a broad range of systems used in civilian and military aircraft, at airports and across several other areas of the industry, such as air traffic control and safety.\n\nThese include engines for fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, avionics, communications and vision systems, auxiliary power units (APUs), airport and air traffic management systems, aircraft brakes and even the black boxes where flight data is recorded.\n\nThe aerospace business is also the largest of Honeywell\u2019s divisions, generating around 40% of the group\u2019s revenue of US$28.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTogether with investment bank Goldman Sachs, Honeywell has been working on a plan to spin off its business units since at least December 2024. Analysts quoted by several media outlets estimate that as an independently listed company, Honeywell\u2019s aerospace business could be valued somewhere in the region of $100 billion.\n\nHere Honeywell is following in the footsteps of GE, another major US conglomerate with interests in the aerospace sector, which spun off its aero engine business, GE Aerospace, in 2024.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s stock dropped 4.4% on February 6, 2025, after the company announced its break-up and a lower-than-expected earnings forecast for 2025.",

During the separation planning process, the company intends to continue its portfolio transformation efforts to improve the value proposition of each business.\n\nIn the second half of next year, the separation is planned to be tax-free for stakeholders. The previously announced spin-off of the Advanced Materials business is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cThe enhanced focus, alignment and strategic agility enabled by this separation will allow Honeywell to realize the opportunity for operational improvement and valuation upside,\u201d say Marc Steinberg, Elliott partner and Jesse Cohn, managing partner of Honeywell. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to support Vimal and the management team as they execute on the separation and deliver significant long-term value to Honeywell\u2019s shareholders.\u201d",

The company also provided its outlook for 2025 and separately announced its Board of Directors completed the comprehensive business portfolio evaluation launched a year ago by chairman and chief executive officer Vimal Kapur and intends to pursue a full separation of Automation and Aerospace Technologies.\n\nThe company reported fourth-quarter year-over-year sales growth of 7% and organic1 sales growth of 2%, or 6% excluding the impact of the previously announced Bombardier agreement4, led by double-digit organic1 sales growth in defense and space and building solutions. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, Honeywell's backlog grew 11% to a record $35.3 billion. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.96, up 3% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share1 was $2.47, down 8% year over year, exceeding previous guidance, or up 9% excluding the $0.45 impact of the Bombardier agreement4. Operating income increased 10% and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 17.3%. Segment profit1 decreased 8% to $2.1 billion and segment margin1 contracted 350 basis points to 20.9%, or 70 basis points to 23.7% excluding the impact of the Bombardier agreement4. Operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, down 23%, and free cash flow1 was $1.9 billion, down 27%.\n\nFor the full year, sales increased 5%, and 3% organically1 (or 4% organically ex. BBD4), exceeding previous guidance. Operating income grew 5% and operating margin remained flat, while segment profit1 grew 1%, (or 6% ex. BBD4), with segment margin1 contraction of 90 basis points (or 20 basis points ex. BBD4), driven by another quarter of strength in long-cycle businesses outpacing short-cycle recovery within Industrial Automation. Honeywell reported full-year earnings per share of $8.71, up 3% year over year. Full year adjusted earnings per share1 increased 4% to $9.89 and increased 9% to $10.34 excluding the $0.45 impact of the Bombardier agreement4.\n\n\"We delivered a strong end to a successful year, exceeding the high end of our guidance for fourth quarter sales and adjusted earnings per share1 while navigating a dynamic operating environment,\" said Vimal Kapur, chairman and CEO of Honeywell. \"In 2024, we also made significant progress optimizing Honeywell's portfolio. We completed four strategic bolt-on acquisitions representing $9 billion in capital deployed and announced two key divestitures in alignment with our portfolio simplification strategy, including the planned spin of our Advanced Materials business. As we look toward 2025, I am confident that our revitalized portfolio optimization strategy, established history of operational excellence, and robust installed base will unlock further value creation for our shareholders, customers, and employees.\"\n\nHoneywell also announced its outlook for 2025. The company expects sales of $39.6 billion to $40.6 billion with organic1 sales growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Segment margin2 is expected to be in the range of 23.2% to 23.6%, with segment margin2 expansion of 60 to 100 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share2,3 is expected to be in the range of $10.10 to $10.50, up 2% to 6%. The company expects operating cash flow of $6.7 billion to $7.1 billion, and free cash flow1 of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the Bombardier agreement4, the company expects organic1 sales growth of 1% to 4%, segment margin2 down 10 to up 30 basis points year over year, and adjusted earnings per share2,3 down 2% to up 2% year over year. Guidance assumes a mid-year close of the previously announced sale of the company's Personal Protective Equipment business. A summary of the company's 2025 guidance can be found in Table 1.\n\nSeparately, Honeywell announced that its Board of Directors concluded its comprehensive portfolio review and has decided to pursue a separation of its Automation and Aerospace businesses. The planned separation, coupled with the previously announced plan to spin Advanced Materials, will result in three publicly listed industry leaders with distinct strategies and growth drivers. The separation is intended to be completed in the second half of 2026 and in a manner that is tax-free to Honeywell shareholders.\n\nKapur commented, \"The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers. Our simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value.\"\n\nFourth-Quarter Performance\n\nHoneywell sales for the fourth quarter were up 7% year over year on a reported basis and 2% on an organic1 basis year over year. The fourth-quarter financial results can be found in Tables 2 and 3.\n\nAerospace Technologies sales for the fourth quarter increased 1% on an organic1 basis year over year, or 11% excluding the impact of the Bombardier agreement4, driven by strong performance in commercial aftermarket and defense and space. Commercial aftermarket led growth in the quarter, up 17% organically as continued demand in air transport drove increased flight activity. Defense and space sales increased 14% organically as a result of ongoing global demand and further supply chain improvements. Segment margin contracted 780 basis points to 20.3% as higher volume leverage and productivity actions were more than offset by the Bombardier agreement4, cost inflation, and mix pressure in our original equipment business. Excluding Bombardier4, segment margin contracted 100 basis points to 27.1%.\n\nIndustrial Automation sales were flat on an organic1 basis year over year for the fourth quarter and up 3% sequentially. Process solutions grew 3% organically, the third consecutive quarter of both year over year and sequential growth, driven by continued strength in lifecycle solutions and services. Productivity solutions and services grew a third consecutive quarter and in full year 2024 when excluding the impact of prior year license and settlement payments. Sensing and safety technologies decreased 4% year over year, but the sensing business returned to growth in the quarter. Orders were a bright spot in the quarter, up 7% highlighted by double-digit growth in warehouse and workflow solutions and the sensing portion of sensing and safety technologies. Segment margin contracted 200 basis points to 19.6%, driven by cost inflation, prior year license and settlement payments, and one-time asset write-downs, partially offset by commercial excellence and productivity actions.\n\nBuilding Automation sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% organically1 year over year. Organic growth of 11% in building solutions was led by mid-teens growth in North America and over 50% growth in the Middle East. Building products grew organically in the fourth quarter, led by double-digit growth in fire products. Overall, Europe returned to growth in the quarter, while high growth regions grew by 14%. Orders grew double digits year over year on an organic basis due to strength in both building solutions and fire products. Segment margin expanded 250 basis points to 26.8% driven by productivity actions, commercial excellence, and benefit from the access solutions acquisition partially offset by cost inflation.\n\nEnergy and Sustainability Solutions sales for the fourth quarter grew 1% on an organic1 basis. UOP led growth for ESS, up 3% on robust gas processing solutions and equipment demand. Advanced Materials sales declined 1% organically in the quarter as expected macro-related headwinds in fluorine products were partially offset by continued strength in our specialty chemicals and materials business. Orders grew 19% year over year, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Segment margin contracted 180 basis points to 24.9%, driven by cost inflation and volume deleverage in advanced materials partially offset by commercial excellence and benefit from the LNG acquisition.\n\nAbout Bombardier Agreement\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Honeywell announced the signing of a strategic agreement with Bombardier, a global leader in aviation and manufacturer of world-class business jets, to provide advanced technology for current and future Bombardier aircraft in avionics, propulsion, and satellite communications technologies. The collaboration will advance new technology to enable a host of high-value upgrades for the installed Bombardier operator base, as well as lay innovative foundations for future aircraft. Honeywell estimates the value of this partnership to the company at $17 billion over its life. While the commercial agreement impacted Honeywell's fourth quarter 2024 financials4, the company is confident it will lead to long-term value creation for Honeywell shareholders.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nHoneywell will discuss its fourth-quarter results and full-year 2025 guidance during an investor conference call starting at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time today. A live webcast of the investor call as well as related presentation materials will be available through the Investor Relations section of the company's website ( www.honeywell.com/investor ).

Management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the impact and timing on future operating results arising from items excluded from segment margin or adjusted EPS. We therefore, do not present a guidance range, or a reconciliation to, the nearest GAAP financial measures of operating margin or EPS. 3\n\nAdjusted EPS and adjusted EPS V% guidance excludes items identified in the non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted EPS at the end of this release, and any potential future one-time items that we cannot reliably predict or estimate such as pension mark-to-market. 4\n\n4Q24 financial results include impact of the Bombardier Agreement (BBD) announced on December 2, 2024, resulting in a reduction to Sales of $0.4B, Net Income of $0.3B, and Cash Flow of $0.5B.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Honeywell concluded the assets and liabilities of the personal protective equipment business (part of the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit within the Industrial Automation segment) met the held for sale criteria as of September 30, 2024; therefore, Honeywell presented the associated assets and liabilities of the business as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company recognized a valuation allowance of $125 million in the third quarter of 2024 to write down the disposal group to fair value, less costs to sell, as well as recorded an impairment charge of $37 million (after tax) on indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the fourth quarter, the Company recognized an increase to the valuation allowance of $94 million.\n\nAbout Honeywell\n\nHoneywell is an integrated operating company serving a broad range of industries and geographies around the world.

Management believes the change to adjust for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and certain acquisition- and divestiture-related costs provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its performance period to period, aligns the measure to how management will evaluate performance internally, and makes it easier for investors to compare our performance to peers. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain measures presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes.\n\nManagement does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Honeywell's business.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

We believe this measure is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\nA quantitative reconciliation of reported sales percent change to organic sales percent change has not been provided for forward-looking measures of organic sales percent change because management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the fluctuations in global currency markets that impact foreign currency translation, nor is it reasonable for management to predict the timing, occurrence and impact of acquisition and divestiture transactions, all of which could significantly impact our reported sales percent change.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

Includes acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and third-party transaction and integration costs.\n\nWe define operating income as net sales less total cost of products and services sold, research and development expenses, impairment of assets held for sale, and selling, general and administrative expenses. We define segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, as operating income, excluding stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement service costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and impairments, and repositioning and other charges. We define segment profit margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, as segment profit divided by net sales. We believe these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\nA quantitative reconciliation of operating income to segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, has not been provided for all forward-looking measures of segment profit and segment profit margin included herein. Management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the impact and timing on future operating results arising from items excluded from segment profit, particularly pension mark-to-market expense as it is dependent on macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and the return generated on invested pension plan assets. The information that is unavailable to provide a quantitative reconciliation could have a significant impact on our reported financial results. To the extent quantitative information becomes available without unreasonable effort in the future, and closer to the period to which the forward-looking measures pertain, a reconciliation of operating income to segment profit will be included within future filings.\n\nAcquisition amortization and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs are significantly impacted by the timing, size, and number of acquisitions or divestitures we complete and are not on a predictable cycle and we make no comment as to when or whether any future acquisitions or divestitures may occur. We believe excluding these costs provides investors with a more meaningful comparison of operating performance over time and with both acquisitive and other peer companies.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, the adjustment for acquisition-related costs, which are principally comprised of third-party transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory, is approximately $59 million and $7 million, net of tax benefit of approximately $16 million and $2 million, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2025, the expected adjustment for acquisition-related costs, which is principally comprised of third-party transaction and integration costs, is approximately $5 million, net of tax benefit of approximately $0 million. 5\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the adjustment for divestiture-related costs, which is principally comprised of third-party transaction costs, is approximately $23 million, net of tax benefit of approximately $6 million. 6\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the adjustment is a $17 million expense, without tax benefit, due to the settlement of a contractual dispute with a Russian entity associated with the Company's suspension and wind down activities in Russia. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the adjustment was a $3 million benefit, without tax expense. 7\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the adjustment was $8 million, net of tax benefit of $3 million, due to the net expense related to the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale. 8\n\nBendix Friction Materials (\"Bendix\") is a business no longer owned by the Company. In 2023, the Company changed its valuation methodology for calculating legacy Bendix liabilities. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the adjustment was $330 million, net of tax benefit of $104 million (or $434 million pre-tax) due to a change in the estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. The Company experienced fluctuations in average resolution values year-over-year in each of the past five years with no well-established trends in either direction. In 2023, the Company observed two consecutive years of increasing average resolution values (2023 and 2022), with more volatility in the earlier years of the five-year period (2019 through 2021). Based on these observations, the Company, during its annual review in the fourth quarter of 2023, reevaluated its valuation methodology and elected to give more weight to the two most recent years by shortening the look-back period from five years to two years (2023 and 2022). The Company believes that the average resolution values in the last two consecutive years are likely more representative of expected resolution values in future periods. The $434 million pre-tax amount was attributable primarily to shortening the look-back period to the two most recent years, and to a lesser extent to increasing expected resolution values for a subset of asserted claims to adjust for higher claim values in that subset than in the modelled two-year data set. It is not possible to predict whether such resolution values will increase, decrease, or stabilize in the future, given recent litigation trends within the tort system and the inherent uncertainty in predicting the outcome of such trends. The Company will continue to monitor Bendix claim resolution values and other trends within the tort system to assess the appropriate look-back period for determining average resolution values going forward. 9\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the impairment charge of indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the personal protective equipment business was $37 million, net of tax benefit of $11 million. 10\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the impairment charge of assets held for sale was $94 million and $219 million, respectively, without tax benefit.\n\n\n\nNote: Amounts may not foot due to rounding\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\nReconciliation of Earnings per Share to Adjusted Earnings per Share (Continued)\n\n(Unaudited)\n\nWe define adjusted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude various charges as listed above. We believe adjusted earnings per share is a measure that is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends. For forward-looking information, management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the pension mark-to-market expense or the divestiture-related costs. The pension mark-to-market expense is dependent on macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and the return generated on invested pension plan assets. The divestiture-related costs are subject to detailed development and execution of separation restructuring plans for the announced separation of Automation and Aerospace Technologies. We therefore do not include an estimate for the pension mark-to-market expense or divestiture-related costs. Based on economic and industry conditions, future developments, and other relevant factors, these assumptions are subject to change.\n\nAcquisition amortization and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs are significantly impacted by the timing, size, and number of acquisitions or divestitures we complete and are not on a predictable cycle and we make no comment as to when or whether any future acquisitions or divestitures may occur. We believe excluding these costs provides investors with a more meaningful comparison of operating performance over time and with both acquisitive and other peer companies.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

            "content": "Honeywell, one of the last remaining U.S. industrial conglomerates, will split into three independent companies, following in the footsteps of manufacturing giants like General Electric and Alcoa.\n\nThe company said Thursday that it will separate from its automation and aerospace technologies businesses. Including plans announced earlier to spin off its advanced materials business, Honeywell will consist of three smaller entities in hopes that they will each be more agile.\n\n\u201cThe formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement.\n\nHoneywell had said in December that it was considering spinning off its aerospace division. The public announcement arrived about one month after Elliott Investment Management revealed a stake of more than $5 billion in the aerospace, automation and materials company. Elliott had been pushing for the Charlotte, North Carolina, company to separate its automation and aerospace businesses.\n\nThe board of Honeywell International Inc. had been exploring strategic options for the company since earlier in 2024.\n\nThe company, which makes everything from eye solution to barcode readers, has been seeking ways to make itself more nimble. Over the past year and a half, just after Kapur took over as CEO, Honeywell has announced plans for the advanced materials business spinoff, entered into an agreement to sell its personal protective equipment business, and made several acquisitions.\n\nThe separation of the automation and aerospace technologies businesses is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026. The spinoff of the advanced materials business is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year or early next year.\n\nLike Honeywell, other U.S. conglomerates have been pressured by shareholders to simplify their structures, allowing each segment of the company to move more freely and adapt to changes in their respective markets.\n\nIconic CEOs like Jack Welch of General Electric spent years building corporate American behemoths with the belief that with scale came power. Yet those massive companies were forced to compete with upstarts with a narrow focus and a more clearly defined set of goals.\n\nInvestors also wanted a more clear view of the priorities within each division, which became more murky as the companies grew.\n\nIn 2015 metals maker Alcoa said that it was splitting into two independent companies, separating its bauxite, aluminum and casting operations from its engineering, transportation and global rolled products businesses.\n\nGE announced in 2021 that it was dividing itself into three public companies focused on aviation, health care and energy. At the time, the move was viewed as a potential signal of the end of conglomerates as a whole thanks to the move toward a digital economy.\n\nShares fell almost 3% before the market opened Thursday.",

Advanced Materials \u2013 Focused on fluorine products, electronic materials, and other high-tech materials for various industries.\n\nThe End of the Conglomerate Era?\n\nHoneywell\u2019s decision follows a broader trend in the industrial and aerospace sectors, where large conglomerates have opted for breakups to create more agile, specialized companies. Industry giants like United Technologies and General Electric have already undergone similar transformations, separating their major divisions to better allow those units to focus on core competencies and market-specific growth strategies.\n\nThe rationale behind these breakups is clear\u2014by establishing distinct entities, each business unit can better adapt to market demands, drive innovation, and maximize investor returns.\n\nActivist Investors Play a Role\n\nThe restructuring comes on the heels of activist investment firm Elliott Management acquiring a $5 billion stake in Honeywell in November. Elliott, known for pushing companies toward strategic overhauls to enhance shareholder value, appears to have played a key role in influencing Honeywell\u2019s decision to restructure.\n\nIn December, Honeywell announced its intent to explore a spinoff of its aerospace division, a move that aligns with Elliott\u2019s strategy of unlocking value through corporate separation. This followed an earlier announcement in October that the company would spin off its advanced materials business into an independent entity.\n\nThe breakup will be executed in phases:\n\nThe Advanced Materials spinoff is expected to be completed by late 2025 or early 2026 .\n\nspinoff is expected to be completed . The separation of Aerospace and Automation is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs Honeywell embarks on this transformation, the newly independent companies will be positioned to pursue focused growth strategies, enhance innovation, and compete more effectively in their respective industries. This move signals not just a new chapter for Honeywell, but also a continued shift in the corporate landscape, where specialization is becoming the key to long-term success.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The industrial conglomerate already had announced it would spin off its advanced materials arm. The moves would create three separate companies.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. has 7,111 employees in Arizona, according to The Arizona Republic\u2019s Republic 100 data of the largest employers in the state, making it the 25th largest employer here.\n\nHoneywell has locations around metro Phoenix and the state, with a heavy emphasis on aerospace. The global headquarters for Honeywell Aerospace is near Sky Harbor International Airport, near 20th Street and Sky Harbor Circle. The company also has facilities in the Deer Valley area, west Phoenix, Glendale, Tempe, Chandler and southern Arizona.\n\nMost of Honeywell Aerospace's sales are in the Americas, according to company documents, with about 23% of sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 14% in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nArizona economic development leaders celebrated the move and the company's commitment to remaining in Phoenix.\n\n\"Honeywell Aerospace has been a vital industry partner in Arizona for more than 80 years, and we're excited to serve as the launching pad for their next chapter,\" Sandra Watson, president and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority, said in a statement. \"We congratulate company leaders and look forward to continuing to work together to advance our already robust aerospace ecosystem.\"\n\nPhoenix Community and Economic Development Director Chris Mackay said the decision allows the advanced manufacturing ecosystem in Phoenix to \"breathe a sigh of relief\" knowing the company is keeping Phoenix as its home base.\n\nOne of the city's goals is to have the corporate headquarters of publicly traded companies located in the city, Mackay said.\n\n\"When the mothership is in your city, when the decisions are being made here, there is so much more connectivity to the community,\" she said.\n\nPhoenix \"brags a lot\" about having Honeywell's aerospace division in the city, Mackay said. And \"it's huge for us\" that the city remains the spinoff company's corporate headquarters.\n\nAerospace industry jobs have a multiplier effect of between four and five, meaning that for each job in the industry there is a ripple effect of four or five additional jobs created in the market, like induced demand for services and retail, she said.\n\nThe company plans to complete the separation by the second half of 2026, and it will be done in a manner that is tax-free to Honeywell shareholders, Vimal Kapur, chairman and CEO announced. Each of the three companies would be publicly listed.\n\n\"The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\" Kapur said in a statement.\n\n\"Our simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value.

According to Honeywell, it had $15 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nThe spinoff could create future job opportunities for employees as the individual companies grow, a company representative said.\n\n\"As Aerospace prepares for unprecedented demand in the years ahead across both commercial and defense markets, now is the right time for the business to begin its own journey as a standalone, public company,\" Kapur said in a statement.\n\nIn the company's Thursday morning earnings call, Kapur said the split was following a yearlong review assessing the full separation of the company's largest businesses. During the review, it became clear that the strategy for aerospace was diverting from the rest of the company, so separating would create a better chance to drive growth in each sector from the new spinoff companies.\n\nSeparating will better position Honeywell Aerospace to innovate in electrification of aircraft and autonomy of flight, he said during the call. Honeywell will continue with investment in research and development, as well as acquisitions in high-growth areas.\n\n\"We will not see any lack of momentum in aerospace investments in the next 18 months ahead,\" Kapur said.\n\nThe move, he said, will make Honeywell Aerospace one of the largest publicly traded aerospace providers.

Here\u2019s what investors should know.\n\nHoneywell missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 1.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $9.73 billion, up 5.6% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but a miss of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates.\n\nIs Honeywell a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Honeywell\u2019s revenue to grow 4.2% year on year to $9.84 billion, improving from the 2.8% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.32 per share.\n\nHoneywell Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Honeywell has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Honeywell\u2019s peers in the general industrial machinery segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. GE Aerospace delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 4.5%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.9%, and Crane reported revenues up 12.3%, topping estimates by 1.2%. GE Aerospace traded up 4.5% following the results while Crane was also up 12.3%.\n\nRead our full analysis of GE Aerospace\u2019s results here and Crane\u2019s results here.\n\nInvestors in the general industrial machinery segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices up 1.7% on average over the last month. Honeywell is up 1.3% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $244.72 (compared to the current share price of $223.54).\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

            "content": "Dublin, Feb. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Military Vehicle Sustainment Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2020-2030F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Military Vehicle Sustainment Market was valued at USD 17.22 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 25.85 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.07%.\n\nThe demand for sustainment services for aging military vehicles is increasing. These services are essential for keeping military vehicles operational. Government support and rising investments are driving the development of military vehicles, further accelerating the growth of the Military Vehicle Sustainment market. These services improve vehicle efficiency and extend the lifespan of military assets. Various maintenance approaches, such as condition-based maintenance and predictive maintenance, are employed to ensure the optimal functioning of military vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe military vehicle sustainment sector is experiencing a significant shift towards the development of next-generation armored vehicles and comprehensive product line improvements. Modernization efforts are focused on enhancing vehicle capabilities and ensuring they meet evolving operational demands. Manufacturers are placing a strong emphasis on innovation and flexibility in their designs to address a wide range of customer requirements. In February 2024, EDGE Group's NIMR introduced the JAIS Mark 2 (MK2), showcasing the successful development of its next-generation armored vehicle series. As a leading manufacturer of combat-tested wheeled military vehicles, NIMR unveiled the second-generation JAIS MK2 at the World Defense Show (WDS) 2024.\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nAdoption of Predictive Maintenance and Smart Technologies\n\n\n\nA major trend in the Global Military Vehicle Sustainment Market is the increasing adoption of predictive maintenance and smart technologies. By leveraging data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and artificial intelligence (AI), military forces can predict potential failures before they occur. Sensors embedded within vehicles monitor key parameters like engine temperature, pressure levels, and component wear.\n\n\n\nThis real-time data is then analyzed using AI algorithms to forecast when a vehicle is likely to require maintenance or experience a breakdown. Predictive maintenance not only helps in reducing downtime but also optimizes the lifecycle of military vehicles, making maintenance more cost-effective. Instead of relying on routine inspections or reactive repairs, military organizations can now take a more proactive approach, addressing issues before they lead to operational disruptions. This trend is gaining momentum due to the growing availability of affordable IoT sensors, cloud computing, and the advancement of AI technology, making it increasingly feasible to implement on a large scale.\n\n\n\nSustainment through Modular Design and Upgrades\n\n\n\nAnother key trend is the focus on modular design and system upgrades to prolong the lifespan of military vehicles. As defense budgets face constraints, military forces are opting to upgrade existing vehicles rather than procure new ones. Modular vehicle designs facilitate easier and more cost-effective upgrades, as specific components or systems can be replaced or enhanced without requiring a complete overhaul of the entire vehicle.\n\n\n\nThis approach is especially beneficial for improving the technological capabilities of older vehicles, such as adding new communication systems, advanced armor, or hybrid propulsion systems. The flexibility offered by modular designs makes it easier to adapt vehicles to changing mission requirements without the need for entirely new platforms. This trend is particularly prominent in military sectors seeking to modernize without incurring the high costs associated with purchasing entirely new fleets. Modular design and upgrades are becoming integral to vehicle sustainment strategies, ensuring the continued relevance of military fleets.\n\n\n\nRegional Insights\n\n\n\nNorth America dominated the Global Military Vehicle Sustainment Market due to its substantial defense budgets, advanced technological capabilities, and the size of its military fleets. The United States, as a leading global military power, invests heavily in maintaining its vast array of military vehicles, which include combat vehicles, tactical trucks, and armored personnel carriers. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps require constant sustainment to ensure these vehicles remain operational in diverse environments.\n\n\n\nMoreover, North America is at the forefront of adopting advanced sustainment technologies, such as predictive maintenance, AI-driven diagnostics, and modular upgrades, which further contribute to market growth. The region also benefits from robust defense contractors and suppliers, enhancing the efficiency of vehicle maintenance and parts procurement. Additionally, geopolitical concerns, particularly in relation to global security and defense commitments, drive continuous demand for vehicle sustainment services in North America, solidifying its market dominance.\n\n\n\nKey Market Players\n\nRheinmetall\n\nBAE Systems\n\nGeneral Dynamics\n\nElbit Systems\n\nOshkosh Corporation\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nL3Harris Technologies\n\nThales Group\n\nManTech International\n\nHoneywell International\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 187 Forecast Period 2024 - 2030 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $17.22 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2030 $25.85 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 7.0% Regions Covered Global\n\nReport Scope:\n\n\n\nIn this report, the global Military Vehicle Sustainment Market has been segmented into the following categories, in addition to the industry trends which have also been detailed below:\n\n\n\nMilitary Vehicle Sustainment Market, By Vehicle Type:\n\nArmored Vehicles\n\nMilitary Trucks\n\nMilitary Vehicle Sustainment Market, By Service:\n\nMaintenance, Repair, & Overhaul (MRO)\n\nTraining and Support\n\nParts and Components Supply\n\nUpgrades and Modernization\n\nMilitary Vehicle Sustainment Market, By End User:\n\nArmy\n\nNavy\n\nAir Force\n\nMilitary Vehicle Sustainment Market, By Region:\n\nNorth America United States Canada Mexico\n\nEurope & CIS France Germany Spain Italy United Kingdom\n\nAsia-Pacific China Japan India Vietnam South Korea Australia Thailand\n\nMiddle East & Africa South Africa Saudi Arabia UAE Turkey\n\nSouth America Brazil Argentina\n\n\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/mn0urx\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

In New Jersey, Federal Judge Padin granted Honeywell\u2019s motion and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint without prejudice.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case claimed that using forfeitures to reduce the plan sponsor\u2019s contributions violated ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties. They argued that Honeywell always used forfeitures to reduce employer contributions and that its decision to do so constituted a breach of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as a breach of the \u201canti-inurement\u201d provision in section 403(c)(1) of ERISA.\n\nWhile Judge Padin said that the use of forfeitures to reduce contributions was a fiduciary decision, the Judge suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that every time a plan administrator chooses to use forfeitures to reduce employer contributions it violates its fiduciary duties under ERISA is so broad as to be implausible. The plaintiff would have to show that such a decision was an actual breach.",

            "content": "When you\u2019re shopping for a traditional standard thermostat, there isn\u2019t much to consider. What does it look like? Can you program it? Does it have that cool old-fashioned dial?\n\nWhen shopping for a smart thermostat, there are a lot more options and some things one person may love while the next person may hate. Here\u2019s what we think is important to consider.\n\nSmart home integration\n\nSmart thermostats all come with some kind of app or option to control the device from your phone. If you have a particular affinity for one smart home family or another, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re getting a thermostat that will work in conjunction with your other devices. Most smart thermostats will take voice commands from Amazon\u2019s Alexa, but if the rest of your home is running on, say, Apple\u2019s HomeKit, not every device will provide support.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re getting something that will play nice with the rest of your smart home.\n\nGeofencing\n\nFor the most part, your thermostat\u2019s job is to keep your home comfortable for you. That means you don\u2019t necessarily need it to be the perfect temperature when you aren\u2019t home. Many smart thermostats feature geofencing, meaning they can track whether or not you\u2019re home and set their expectations accordingly.\n\nSome devices track occupancy based on the phones of those in the household, while others combine that feature with other occupancy sensors. The good thing is that you can set limits around this feature: Do you want it to change the temperature when you\u2019re away? How far away do you have to be for it to kick in? What temperature limits should there be if you aren\u2019t home? The latter is important if you have pets. You don\u2019t want the cats sweltering or freezing while you\u2019re at work.\n\nHow smart do you want your thermostat to be?\n\nEveryone wants a different level of control over their thermostat. Some people want to decide at every moment what the temperature should be. (In that case, you can also consider a basic Wi-Fi-enabled programmable thermostat like the Honeywell Home RTH6580WF, which doesn\u2019t have as many smart features as its more expensive peers but can be adjusted from your phone.)\n\nSome smart thermostats can be too smart for their own good. One of the most common complaints I\u2019ve heard is that some products will hold the temperature you set them to only for a little bit, and then they\u2019ll revert to what the thermostat believes the temperature should be. If that would annoy you, focus on the ones that offer you the most control like the Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat.\n\nInstallation\n\nNot all thermostats are installed exactly the same way, but they\u2019re all pretty similar. Expect to need a screwdriver, a pair of pliers capable of moving wires around and potentially a drill and a level. Installation is pretty simple once you\u2019ve done it once or twice: Turn off the power, mark the wires, take off the old one, wire the new one, and put the thermostat up. There is one potential complication you\u2019ll want to watch out for: Does your system have a C-wire?\n\nThere are usually five or so wires that come out of your wall to connect a thermostat. The older wires tend to carry just enough electricity to power an old-school thermostat. Smarter devices, which can tell you the weather or maybe play your playlist and need an internet connection, need more power than that. This is achieved through a C-wire, designed to carry more electricity to the thermostat. Not every home is wired with one, but if you don\u2019t have one, you have a couple of choices.\n\nThe first is to get a thermostat that doesn\u2019t require a C-wire. This is where the Nest thermostats are set apart because they\u2019re capable of charging their batteries off the other wires. Although some customer reviews report short-cycling and other issues, so keep an eye on it.\n\nThe second option is to install an adapter kit. This involves adding a device to your HVAC system that converts one of the existing wires into a C-wire. Fortunately, most of the smart thermostats we\u2019ve looked at that require a C-wire come with these kits. If not, you can pick one up for something like $26.\n\nExternal sensors\n\nYour thermostat knows what the temperature is because it has a thermometer inside of it. The device\u2019s understanding of the temperature inside is usually limited to the temperature exactly where you mounted it to the wall. What about that stuffy bedroom?\n\nMany smart thermostats come with or are at least able to connect to separate room sensors. These room sensors allow you to train the thermostat to keep your house as comfortable as possible throughout the home. With external sensors, thermostats can target an individual room and get it to a comfortable temperature at a certain time (the bedroom at night, the home office during the day, etc.) or find a setting that makes everywhere as comfortable as possible, not just the room with the thermostat in it. Some even have proximity sensors in their room sensors, meaning they can tell when a room is occupied or not.",

            "content": "If you want to make sure you're not spending all your money on your electricity bill, one of the best smart thermostats can help. It can detect when you\u2019re not at home, so it'll turn down the heat, but then have your house ready at the right temperature for when you return. They can also analyze your patterns and the weather and make suggestions as to what temperature you should set to reduce your energy bill.\n\nBut, which one is best for you? After testing a number of the best smart thermostats in our own homes to find out how they perform under real-world circumstances, we think the best overall is the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium; while it's the most expensive, it has the best features and works with the most smart home systems. But, if your budget is tighter, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is less than $100, and ties in nicely with Alexa.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many utilities offer rebates on smart thermostats that are Energy Star certified, so you should check with your local energy provider to see what discounts they offer. In some cases, you can get a smart thermostat for as little as one dollar.\n\nHere are the best smart thermostats we've tested.\n\nThe quick list\n\nRecent updates\n\nThe best smart thermostats you can buy today\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nThe best smart thermostat overall\n\n(Image credit: Ecobee)\n\n1. Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium The best smart thermostat overall Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Works With: Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT Remote Sensors: Yes Self-Installation: Yes Motion Activation: Yes Works Offline: Yes Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Newegg (Black) View at Dell Reasons to buy + Full Alexa support + Improved remote sensors from previous model + Much improved and larger display Reasons to avoid - Larger than Nest Learning Thermostat\n\nWith its zinc case and much larger touchscreen, we think the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium looks much better than previous generations \u2014 while it may not be as stylish as the Nest Learning Thermostat, it doesn't look cheap, and its bigger display meant we were able to better see it from across the room.\n\nIt's even smarter on the inside, with an air quality sensor built in, so you can see if you need to open a window or turn on a fan. We just wish that you could link the air quality readings to, say, one of the best air purifiers or a room fan to turn on automatically if the air quality drops.\n\nAs before, the one feature that we think elevates Ecobee smart thermostats above all others are its remote sensors, which make it easier for you to manage the temperature in your entire home. For example, you can place a sensor in a room that tends to stay cold, and program the thermostat to keep heating your house until the temperature in that room gets warm enough. While Nest also works with remote sensors, only Ecobee's includes a presence sensor, so you won't be heating a room with no one in it.\n\nThe Ecobee works with every major smart home platform, but goes one further, as it has Alexa built in; if you have a HomePod or HomePod mini, can also talk to Siri through the thermostat. The built-in speaker is still not great for listening to music, but it's a way to get a smart speaker in a room where you don't want to place an Echo Dot.\n\nEcobee's thermostat also doubles as a hub for the company's budding smart home security system; if you have the Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera, or Ecobee SmartCamera, you can get a live view on the Smart Thermostat Premium, so you don't need to take out your phone to see who's at the door. Ecobee also sells door and window sensors and works with the best smart locks from Yale and August, so if you subscribe to Ecobee Smart Security (starting at $5/month), you can use the thermostat to arm and disarm your home security system.\n\nIf the Premium model is too pricey, Ecobee also offers the Smart Thermostat Enhanced for $189; however, this model does not include an indoor air quality monitor, built-in Bluetooth speaker, smoke alarm detect, or the option to use Siri or Alexa on the device.\n\nRead our full Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium review.\n\nBest value\n\nEcobee3 Lite (Image credit: Ecobee)\n\n2. Ecobee3 Lite A simple smart thermostat that lets you use remote sensors. Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Works With: Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings, Logitech, Wink, IFTTT Remote Sensors: Yes Self-Installation: Yes Motion Activation: Yes Works Offline: Yes Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (Black) View at ecobee View at Lowe's Reasons to buy + Works with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple HomeKit + Attractive interface + Easy installation + Works with remote sensors Reasons to avoid - Lacks geofencing\n\nLike the Ecobee SmartThermostat Premium, but are looking for something less expensive? The Ecobee 3 Lite has many of the features we like on Ecobee's top-end model, but costs $100 less.\n\nThe Ecobee 3 Lite has a color touchscreen \u2014 though it's smaller than the Premium model \u2014 with just as intuitive an interface. You're also not getting the nice metal frame; this model is all-plastic.\n\nStill, the Ecobee 3 Lite will work with Ecobee's remote sensors, so you can set it to keep the heat on until a room in a far corner of your house reaches a certain temperature. Unlike the Premium model, none come bundled; you have to purchase those sensors separately.\n\nThe Ecobee 3 Lite works with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant and Alexa, but unlike the Ecobee SmartThermostat, Amazon's voice assistant isn't built into the thermostat. It also doesn't support HVAC accessories, so you can't use it if, say, you have two-stage heating and cooling. It also lacks eco+, which learns your schedule and recommends changes to help save you money.\n\nBut, if you want a connected thermostat at a reasonable price, this is a model to check out.\n\nRead our full Ecobee3 Lite review.\n\nBest budget smart thermostat\n\n(Image credit: Amazon)\n\nThe Amazon Smart Thermostat isn't as intelligent as the Nest or the Ecobee models above, but it does use Alexa's hunches to gain some smarts in knowing when to turn the temperature up or down. At $59, it's one of the most affordable smart thermostats around, and we found it very easy to install and program in our home. It has a simple but clean aesthetic that fits in almost anywhere, too.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need a C-Wire, or else you'll need to purchase a C-Wire adapter (sold separately) for the Amazon Smart Thermostat to work. Unlike the Nest and Ecobee models, there are no remote sensors for you to monitor the temperature in other rooms, but if you have Amazon Echo devices \u2014 such as the Echo Dot \u2014 you can use the temperature sensors in them to set up a routine to activate the Amazon Smart Thermostat. And, of course, it only works with Alexa. But, at this price, those are compromises we're willing to overlook.\n\nRead our full Amazon Smart Thermostat review.\n\nBest Nest thermostat\n\nNest Learning Thermostat (gen 4) (Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n4. Nest Learning Thermostat (gen 4) Nest's smart thermostat is a cinch to set up and has a sleek new design Our expert review: Specifications Works With: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Logitech, HomeKit, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings, Remote Sensors: Yes Self-Installation: Yes Motion Activation: Yes Works Offline: Yes Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (Black) View at Best Buy View at Google Store NA Reasons to buy + Sleek new design + No C-wire required for power + Dynamic Farsight provides useful info + Improved smart home integration and Matter support Reasons to avoid - One of the most expensive smart thermostats\n\nGoogle has given its Nest Learning Thermostat its first major upgrade in almost a decade with a brand new design, enhanced AI capabilities and its top-of-the-line smart thermostat now comes bundled with a temperature sensor. We've used the previous version for years now and this new model is exactly the upgrade we were waiting for. In addition to being 60% larger, its screen now appears to float on the wall thanks to its new design where the base is smaller than the screen itself.\n\nLikewise, the Dynamic Farsight feature can now show you all sorts of useful info like the time, date, temperature and even the weather when you approach your thermostat. We really loved getting all of this information at a glance when we left our bedroom and walked past the thermostat in the morning. It\u2019s almost like having a smart display on my wall that looks more like a larger Pixel Watch than a thermostat.\n\nGoogle has overhauled the installation process and you no longer need a C-wire to power your smart thermostat. This was the biggest improvement for us, as we used to take the previous version off the wall to charge it occasionally. Now that we don\u2019t have to worry about my thermostat\u2019s battery running out, we're able to take advantage of Dynamic Farsight and all of the different home screens.\n\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) now has improved AI features too; we liked how Smart Schedule allowed us to accept or reject any of the suggested changes to how we heat and cool our home that the thermostat makes in the Google Home app.\n\nWith the inclusion of Matter, you can use any Matter-compatible smart home app you want to control your thermostat. You\u2019re still paying a premium for the Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) but for the price, you now get a temperature sensor with it that you can use to prioritize the climate in a particular room or area of your house. However, unlike the remote sensors you get with the Ecobee, Nest's can't detect presence.\n\nRead our full Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) review.\n\nBest cheap Nest thermostat\n\n(Image credit: Google Store)\n\n5. Nest Thermostat The best Nest thermostat for those on a budget Our expert review: Specifications Works With: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, HomeKit, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings Remote Sensors: No Self-Installation: Yes Motion Activation: No Works Offline: Yes Today's Best Deals View at Amazon View at Amazon View at Crutchfield Reasons to buy + Less expensive than Nest Learning Thermostat + Attractive + Works with Apple HomeKit Reasons to avoid - Lacks smarts of Nest Learning Thermostat - Doesn\u2019t work with remote sensors\n\nIf you want a Nest-like experience for half the price, the simply named Nest Thermostat is the best option. While it doesn't have a rotating bezel, it does have an intuitive touch-sensitive strip along one side, and an attractive mirrored front that begs you to touch it (but will leave all sorts of fingerprint smudges if you do).\n\nHowever, for the lower price of the Nest Thermostat, you are giving up two key features: This thermostat doesn't \"learn\" your patterns and adjust the temperature accordingly. Nor can it work with remote sensors, so it won't be as helpful if you have a room that stays particularly cold or hot. But it's available for around $100, and has a feature that its more expensive brother doesn't: Thanks to its Matter integration, the Nest Thermostat can also be used with HomeKit, Apple's smart home platform.\n\nRead our full Nest Thermostat review.\n\nBest no-frills thermostat\n\nHoneywell RTH6580WF (Image credit: Honeywell)\n\n6.

In addition, the Honeywell Home ecosystem includes a wide range of partners, including Arlo, Apple HomeKit, SmartThings, Lutron, Kwikset Kevo, and more.\n\nWhat you don't get with the Honeywell RTH6580WF are the stylish looks of the Nest, nor the remote sensor capabilities found with the Ecobee. But, if all you're looking for is a smart thermostat that delivers on the basics, this is a great model to consider.\n\nRead our full Honeywell RTH6580WF review.\n\nHow to choose the best smart thermostat for you\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a smart thermostat, there are a number of factors you will need to consider.\n\nHow much do you want to spend on a smart thermostat?\n\n$200 plus: For this price, you will find the more premium models from Ecobee and Nest. These will come with the most features and tend to look the most impressive as well. If your home has two-stage heating and cooling, then these will be the best smart thermostats for you. This is because lower value smart thermostats tend not to support more complex HVAC systems.\n\nFor this price, you will find the more premium models from Ecobee and Nest.

Less than $100: These models will cover the basics and can still connect to your smartphone. But, they\u2019re not as easy on the eye, and often aren't as \"smart\": they don't have features that can learn your comings and goings. However, you can often link these to other smart home systems that can sense when you're home and when you're not.\n\nHow big is your house?\n\nAnother factor to consider is the size of your house and whether any rooms struggle to reach the ideal temperature. If this is the case, you may want to consider a model which comes with, or supports, a wireless sensor, such as the Ecobee.\n\nMoney-saving features\n\nThe better smart thermostats can analyze your heating and cooling, and will suggest slight changes to your pre-set temperatures that could save you money. For instance, it might suggest turning the heat down by a degree or two, or turning the A/C warmer; while you'll be unlikely to tell the difference, it could reduce your utility bill over the long run.\n\nSensors\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our favorite smart thermostat (the Ecobee) is that it can be paired with remote sensors, so it can monitor the temperature in multiple rooms of your home. These sensors also have presence detectors built in, so it knows not to heat or cool a room if there's no one in it. If you have the Amazon Smart Thermostat, you can use various Amazon Echo devices as remote sensors, too.\n\nSmart features\n\nYou should also look into other features of interest, such as geofencing, where you can set the ideal temperature for when you\u2019re out of the house and for when you return. It\u2019s also worth checking if the smart thermostat is compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri.\n\nWhile most smart thermostats will work with Alexa or Google Assistant, fewer will work with HomeKit. However, the new Matter standard will make it easier for smart home devices to connect and talk to one another, which should, in theory, open up HomeKit to a greater number of gadgets.\n\nHow we test smart thermostats\n\nThe best way to test a smart thermostat is to use it first-hand in your home, and that\u2019s exactly what we do. We assess how easy it is to install and set up, which is important considering most smart thermostats are designed to be installed by the homeowners themselves.\n\nDuring the trial period, we put each smart thermostat through a set number of tests to see how it handles different situations. We consider how well it responds to changes in temperature and whether we can easily create a schedule. If it comes with an app, that\u2019s also assessed for navigation and effectiveness. The same goes for connectivity to smart home hubs or devices; if it works with Alexa, Google Assistant, or HomeKit, we check its performance there too. Any additional features are trailed as well so we can get a full picture of the product.\n\nHow to install a smart thermostat\n\nFor the most part, installing a thermostat, smart or not, is a fairly easy process, usually involving nothing more than a screwdriver and about half an hour of your time. Here's our guide to how to install a Nest thermostat; however, the procedure is similar for almost any thermostat.\n\nMany smart thermostats require a \"C\" Wire, which provides a steady stream of power to the thermostat. If you're living in a house with a central AC system, chances are you will have a C Wire. If you don't, you'll have to install a C-Wire adapter kit, which will either be included, or will be available for purchase, by the same company that makes your smart thermostat. Be sure to read our guide on why you need a C-Wire and what do you if you don't have one.\n\nSmart thermostats: Frequently asked questions\n\nAre smart thermostats worth it? In the long run, yes. On average, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that a smart thermostat will save you 8%, or around $50 per year on your heating and cooling costs. So, if you were to purchase a smart thermostat that cost $250, it would pay for itself in five years. Keep in mind, though, that many utilities offer rebates on smart thermostats, which will lower their cost. You should also look into other ways to winterize your home, as a well-insulated house will also help you save on your bills.\n\nWhat temperature should I set my thermostat? The answer may surprise you, but according to the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Star program, you should keep your home at 78 degrees while at home, 82 degrees when asleep, and 85 degrees when away. Even if you set your temperature lower, you're unlikely to feel that much of a difference, and you'll be using a lot more energy, according to the DoE.\n\nCan I get a Nest thermostat for free? Depending on your utility provider, you may be able to get a Nest thermostat \u2014 or some other smart thermostat \u2014 for free or for a reduced price. Some utilities also offer rebates for smart thermostats, so it's worth checking before you make a purchase. Check out our section on smart thermostat rebates for more information.\n\nDo I need an electrician to install a smart thermostat? In most cases, you can install a smart thermostat yourself, and should only take about a half hour of your time. However, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions, and be sure to turn off the power to the thermostat before starting, to avoid hurting yourself or damaging either the thermostat or your HVAC system. And, if you're unsure of anything, it's best to consult a professional.\n\nWhat's the difference between a programmable thermostat and a smart thermostat? A programmable thermostat lets you create a schedule that will increase or decrease the temperature in your home at set times. A smart thermostat will also let you create a schedule, but it will also let you control it remotely from your phone. Some smart thermostats can also sense your presence in your home \u2014 or even a particular room \u2014 and then adjust the temperature accordingly. Last, smart thermostats will also connect with other smart home devices so that they can work in concert with each other. Next: 4 ways a smart thermostat can lower your energy bill.\n\nDo smart thermostats work if the power goes out? Unless your smart thermostat has a battery backup, it will stop working if your power goes out. However, it stores all the pertinent information \u2014 such as your heating and cooling preferences and your Wi-Fi \u2014 so that you don't have to reset everything when your power comes back on.\n\nIs there a monthly fee to use a smart thermostat? Typically no. None of the thermostats listed in this guide require a monthly fee to use them, and they're all very good options. Don't waste your money on a smart thermostat that requires you to pay a monthly subscription.\n\nSmart thermostat rebates\n\nSmart thermostats range from around $250 to less than $100 \u2014 we've tested models in all price bands \u2014 but if you have your eye on a more expensive model, you should check with your local energy utility; many offer rebates and other incentives to install a smart thermostat. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, you may also be able to claim a tax credit for the purchase of a smart thermostat, as well as other energy efficiency improvements.\n\nIn fact, you can even get a Nest Thermostat for as little as $1, depending on what your local utility is offering. That's a deal too good to pass up.\n\nUnder the Inflation Reduction Act, you may also be able to claim a tax credit for the purchase of a smart thermostat, as well as other energy efficiency improvements.",

            "content": "When it comes to ultrahigh-end tower fans, Dyson is awfully tough to beat. Its latest, the Dyson TP04, is a behemoth with king-size activated carbon and glass HEPA air filters hugging the base intake. That allows it to purify the air it puts out, removing things like dust and allergens from the air you breathe. Dyson claims it can catch particles as small as 0.3 microns wide. Just know that if it's an air purifier you're after, you can find lots of good options that cost less, as my colleague David Priest can attest.\n\nAir filtration aside, the Dyson boasts 10-speed settings ranging from an ultraquiet 28 decibels up to a 48-decibel blast of concentrated air. It was the most comfortable tower fan I tested, too, with a cool, steady stream of air that feels like a much less forceful version of one of Dyson's bathroom hand dryers. An LCD screen on the front of the device tracks air quality in real time, but you can also set it to display things like the ambient room temperature or the relative humidity. You can also customize the oscillation angle between 45-, 90-, 180- and 350-degree settings, which is a very nice, unique touch. The sleek remote control docks magnetically on top of the fan when you aren't using it, too.\n\nOn top of all of that, the TP04 features app-enabled smarts. I'll admit I didn't spend too much time testing all of the features out, but the app offers a detailed look at the air quality in your home and it lets you create custom cooling schedules too. You can also use it to customize the fan's autopilot mode to your liking. The TP04 also supports voice control via Alexa or via Siri.\n\nAll of that adds up to one of the nicest and most feature-rich tower fans that money can currently buy. Whether or not it's worth the hefty price tag is up to you, but I'll note that it's in the same ballpark as high-end air purifiers from names like Coway and Levoit that don't boast as many features and don't double as tower fans at all.",

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $9.92 billion, exhibiting an increase of 5.1% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.2% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Honeywell International metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Sales- Aerospace Technologies' will likely reach $3.87 billion. The estimate points to a change of +5.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net Sales- Building Automation' reaching $1.78 billion.

That is because the Feb 21, 2025 $120.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Honeywell shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Honeywell is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Diversified Operations industry that ranks in the Bottom 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of $2.71 per share to $2.37 in that period.\n\n\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Honeywell right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

This foundation is essential for executing large-scale operations, as it is engineered to handle high data volumes, increased load, and user concurrency without compromising performance. It also supports the ability to adapt to the evolving needs of organisations as they scale. As companies enter new markets or increase their product lines, TrackWise can adjust to accommodate additional users, data, and processes. Customers can also choose where their data is hosted and processed to ensure it is compliant and meets business objectives.\n\nTrackWise\u2019s AI capabilities also process and synthesise information across multiple languages, delivering summaries in the user's chosen language. Regardless of size, volume, language, location, or budget, our solutions are crafted to meet the varied demands of our clients.\n\n6. How does TrackWise support compliance with regulations?\n\nTrackWise is designed to help our customers support compliance with a wide range of global regulatory requirements, including those outlined by entities such as the FDA, EU MDR, and various ISO standards. TrackWise offers robust frameworks that facilitate adherence to numerous guidelines and regulations, thereby enabling organizations to maintain compliance across different jurisdictions.\n\nOur solutions effectively enable compliance with key standards, such as ISO 9001 (Quality Management System), ISO 13485 (Quality Management Systems for Medical Devices), and 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 (Current Good Manufacturing Practices for Human and Veterinary Pharmaceuticals).

            "content": "Ernest Allen Satren, a longtime resident of Bloomington, Minnesota, passed away peacefully on Monday, January 27, 2025, after a long battle with Alzheimer's. Born on February 20, 1943, in St. Paul, Minnesota, he was the son of Arthur and Esther Satren. After graduating from St. Paul Park High School, he attended the University of Minnesota for a semester before enlisting in the Navy. From 1962 to 1966, he served as an electronic technician at the China Lake Station in the Western Mojave Desert of California. Following his military service, Ernest began a long and distinguished career at Honeywell, working in the research lab for 38 years until his retirement in 2005. During his tenure, he was credited with several U.S. patents.\n\n\n\nIt was at Grace Lutheran Church in St. Paul that he met Sharon Woster, and the two married on July 22, 1978, building a life together rooted in faith and family. He'll be most remembered for his love for the Lord, his commitment to the Church and how he provided and cared for his family over the following years.\n\n\n\nA devoted husband, father, and grandfather, Ernest is survived by his wife, Sharon; his children, Michelle (Aaron) Olson, Micah (Tamara) Satren, Kristin (Josh) Koehnen, and Laura (Robert) Franklin; and his beloved grandchildren, Edell, Jerome, Olen; Brynlee, Broden, Britta, Bryker; Everett, Wyatt; and Jackson. He was a dedicated member of Emmaus Lutheran Church in Bloomington, serving in numerous roles, including church council member, usher, money counter, Bible study leader, and youth group mentor.\n\n\n\nErnest found great joy in working with young people, especially leading camping trips in the Bighorn Mountains in his early years. He cherished watching his children's and grandchildren's sporting and performance events, camping up North with his family, playing games, and volunteering at church.

The expansion paves the way for a future capacity of 5 million TEUs, with additional ship-to-shore equipment to be deployed as demand grows.\n\nSince becoming DP World\u2019s first concession outside the UAE in 1999, the Jeddah terminal has played a crucial role in regional trade. This latest expansion, under a 30-year build-operate-transfer agreement, cements Jeddah\u2019s status as a critical trade gateway and supports Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 goals of boosting trade connectivity and economic diversification.\n\nAn official ceremony was held to mark the opening, attended by the Saudi minister of transport and logistic services, Saleh bin Nasser Al-Jasser; DP World Group Chairman and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem; Abdulla Bin Damithan, CEO and managing director of DP World GCC; and other senior representatives from DP World and Mawani, government entities, and key customers.\n\nSulayem said: \u201cToday marks a significant milestone in our long-term strategic investment in Jeddah Islamic Port. This expansion builds on our 25-year legacy in Jeddah and reinforces our commitment to driving trade growth in the region. With this modernized terminal, we are enhancing efficiency, improving supply chain resilience and creating new trade opportunities for the Kingdom and beyond for decades to come.\u201d\n\nThe terminal\u2019s modernization integrates advanced automation and digitalization to improve operational efficiency. Smart systems will slash gate transaction times \u2014 from two minutes to just 10 seconds \u2014 supported by IoT-enabled cargo tracking and AI-powered cargo tallying for precise record keeping.\n\nIn line with its global sustainability strategy, DP World is implementing initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions at South Container Terminal by 50 percent in the next five years. Measures include the electrification of yard cranes and trucks, solar panel installations, exploration of floating solar platforms, along with green building designs and water recycling systems.\n\nThese efforts will significantly cut emissions, enhance air quality and establish DP World\u2019s Jeddah terminal as a model for sustainable port operations.\n\nAdjacent to the terminal, DP World is investing in the 415,000 square meter Jeddah Logistics Park, the largest integrated facility of its kind in the Kingdom, which will offer state-of-the-art warehousing, distribution and freight forwarding services, further strengthening Jeddah\u2019s position as a key hub connecting trade routes across Asia, Africa and Europe.\n\nIntegrated with the terminal, Jeddah Logistics Park will streamline cargo transfers and enhance efficiency, with completion scheduled for Q2 2026.",

            "content": "One path to amassing a fortune is to identify the next big thing and invest in the companies poised to emerge as the leaders in it. For example, you might have bought shares of Microsoft in the early days of the PC or Amazon in the early innings of the internet.\n\nWhat's the next big thing today? Quantum computing is a top candidate. But which quantum computing stocks are most likely to make you a millionaire?\n\nHigh-risk, potentially high-reward\n\nLet's start by looking at high-risk quantum computing stocks that could be massive winners over the long term. Some of them are already delivering jaw-dropping gains.\n\nFor example, Rigetti Computing's (RGTI -2.23%) share price has skyrocketed at least 1,000% over the last 12 months. Rigetti aims to be the leader in superconducting quantum computing. It has 17 quantum systems installed so far and recently introduced an 84-qubit quantum system called Ankaa-3.\n\nQuantum Computing (QUBT 1.29%) is nipping at Rigetti's heels with a similar gain over the last 12 months. The aptly named company focuses on developing photonic integrated circuits for quantum computers. It has eight installations and is the only pure-play public company specializing in nonlinear quantum optics and integrated photonics.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS 18.73%) is another quantum computing company receiving a lot of attention from investors. Its stock has jumped close to 590% over the last 12 months. D-Wave claims to have the world's largest quantum computer. The company has 132 customers, including 27 members of the Forbes Global 2000.\n\nIonQ (IONQ -2.06%) already markets the Forte and Tempo quantum computers. The company has landed collaborations with major companies such as Ansys and AstraZeneca. It also won a $54.5 million contract to develop quantum systems for the U.S. Air Force Research Lab.\n\nArqit Quantum (ARQQ -3.14%) and Sealsq (LAES -1.79%) are two ancillary quantum computing stocks that have vaulted higher, albeit not at the level of the aforementioned stocks. Both companies provide solutions to protect technology from quantum computing threats. Arqit markets quantum-safe encryption software, while Sealsq makes quantum-resistant microcontrollers.\n\nEstablished players\n\nThere are several alternatives in quantum computing for investors who prefer larger, established players. The biggest in this group is Microsoft. The tech giant's Azure Quantum is a cloud-based quantum computing service.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG -2.53%) (GOOGL -2.60%) has arguably made the biggest splash in quantum computing over the last year. In December 2024, Google announced that its Willow quantum chip reduced errors exponentially as more qubits were used -- a major milestone for quantum computing.\n\nIBM (IBM -1.53%) and Honeywell (HON 0.17%) have each been around for over 100 years. Both are also actively developing quantum computing technology. IBM claims to have \"the largest quantum computing fleet in the world\" with its Qiskit platform. Honeywell merged its quantum computing unit with Cambridge Quantum to form Quantinuum, which it bills as \"the world's largest integrated quantum computing company.\" Although Quantinuum is privately held, Honeywell owns roughly 54% of the company.\n\nMost likely millionaire makers\n\nTheoretically, any of these quantum computing stocks could be millionaire makers with enough money invested up front and enough time. Smaller companies typically have more room to run. However, they also come with the most risk.\n\nI think Rigetti deserves the spotlight it has received in recent months. I also view Quantum Computing, D-Wave, and IonQ as legitimate contenders in the quantum computing market. The problem is that it's impossible to know at this point which of these will ultimately be the most successful.\n\nFor aggressive investors willing to tolerate significant volatility and risk, perhaps the best strategy is to buy shares of each of them and wait. Keep in mind, though, that none of these stocks may deliver positive gains over the long term, much less be millionaire makers.\n\nAmong the established players, Alphabet appears to be the best bet to make $1 million over time. Sure, the company faces some risks -- notably including regulatory challenges. But I fully expect Alphabet's Google unit to continue dominating search for a long time to come.\n\nI look for Google Cloud to keep growing rapidly. Waymo has a huge opportunity in the robotaxi market. And maybe, just maybe, Google will achieve its goal of building \"a useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" by the end of the decade.",

            "content": "Unlike traditional methods of computation that rely on a Binary language, Quantum computers look to leverage quantum bits or \u2018qubits' instead. Unlike Binary, which is built atop 0 and 1, qubits can be superimposed \u2013 meaning they can exist simultaneously as 0 and 1, or anywhere in between. The result is a system that is able to perform certain types of computation at speeds magnitudes quicker than more traditional approaches. The ability to process vast amounts of data and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers is a key reason why Quantum computing is so important. Their unmatched performance means that such systems boast massive potential for advancements in fields like medicine, environmental science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Before its potential can be realized, there are a few significant hurdles that must first be cleared; namely, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental changes (making them error-prone) in addition to only being effective for specific algorithms. With that in mind, the following are a few publicly traded companies leading the way in the research and development of this game-changing approach to computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a notable name that has made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. For example, by using its \u2018127-qubit Eagle quantum computer', IBM has been able to solve complex problems that long stumped the leading classical methods. Despite the challenges of noise and errors in quantum systems, IBM was able to generate accurate results by using an \u2018advanced error mitigation' technique that were verified by running the problem on a traditional supercomputer for lower levels of complexity.\n\nIn the time since its Eagle quantum computer was released, IBM has already developed a 433 qubit system known as \u2018Osprey' and is expected to soon launch a 1,121 qubit system known as Condor. Each of these successive generations greatly improves upon its predecessor while widening the gap between what is possible with a traditional supercomputer. IBM states that,\n\n\u201cAs quantum processors scale up, each additional qubit doubles the amount of space complexity \u2014 the amount of memory space required to execute algorithms \u2014 for a classical computer to reliably simulate quantum circuits.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential abilities of a quantum computer cannot be replicated by more traditional approaches, IBM notes that it does not envision a future where only one exists. Rather, the company anticipates that both quantum and binary variants will continue to thrive in use cases geared specifically toward the strengths of each.\n\nLooking forward, IBM has already announced its next major goal in anticipation of its current quantum chips \u2018outgrowing' the currently used infrastructure. This goal is known as \u2018IBM Quantum System Two'; a modular system that has the potential to support up to 16,632 qubits.\n\nIBM Quantum System Two: Design Sneak Preview\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nIntel is a pioneer in silicon transistors for traditional computing. Whether a desktop or laptop, the chances are good that, regardless of PC form factor, you have utilized a computer powered by an Intel chip.\n\nAs we make our way through 2023, Intel has forged a clear, yet divergent, strategy for the future that involves quantum computing. Drawing upon its existing expertise, Intel is leveraging its expertise in high-volume transistor manufacturing to develop silicon spin qubits. For example, Intel has developed what it calls the \u2018Horse Ridge II cryogenic quantum control chip' that is said to enhance integration, while its \u2018cryoprobers' allow for high-volume testing.\n\nWorking alongside other companies determined to develop commercialized quantum computers, Intel is also doing its part to help. Currently, Intel boasts the \u2018Tunnel Falls' spin qubit chip as its most advanced offering to date and is, \u201c\u2026making the chip available to the quantum research community to spur advancements in the field.\u201d\n\nIntel Quantum Researchers Introduce Tunnel Falls Silicon Qubit Research Chip\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $138.89B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -157.14\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.68\n\nAt the time of writing, Intel boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nOperating out of Santa Barbara is \u2018Quantum AI' \u2013 an endeavor by Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google. The goal of Quantum AI is to, \u201c\u2026build scalable quantum computers that enable humankind to solve problems that would otherwise be impossible.\u201d\n\nBeyond developing the hardware, like the Sycamore processor, for its own take on a quantum computer, Google's Quantum AI also makes available a suite of software designed to assist scientists in the development of quantum algorithms.\n\nDemonstrating Quantum Error Correction\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.54T\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 22.74\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $4.49\n\nAt the time of writing, Alphabet boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nThe quantum computing division at Honeywell is a joint effort known as \u2018Quantinuum', which also involves Cambridge Quantum.\n\nIt is believed that Quantinuum continues to focus on increasing our understanding of \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. This technology involves utilizing ions trapped in a vacuum, which are then manipulated using lasers, allowing for the ions to behave as qubits.\n\nLike each of the companies listed above, Quantinuum is hoping that its design will allow for high precision, while simultaneously boasting error-correction capabilities \u2013 each crucial if quantum computers are ever to become commercially viable.\n\nIntroducing Quantinuum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $132.79B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 21.84\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $7.70\n\nAt the time of writing, Honeywell boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nWhile it may not have the same name recognition as IBM, Intel, and Alphabet, IonQ has still managed to establish itself as a significant player in the field of quantum computing.\n\nIonQ is known specifically for its research on \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. As previously stated, this is a method that leverages qubits comprised of individual ions suspended and manipulated within a vacuum.\n\nAs it stands, IonQ has reportedly developed quantum computers on par with the most powerful across the globe. In fact, its most recent offering is set to become the first of its kind to be utilized in a commercial setting. IonQ boasts that,\n\n\u201cOnce quantum computers are powerful and stable enough, their unique computational power will solve world-changing problems that are beyond the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers.\u201d\n\nThe company indicates that it hopes to achieve this goal through what it believes is a better approach (trapped ions), than those taken by many of its competitors.\n\nIonQ | The Age of Quantum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.92B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -27.56\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.36\n\nAt the time of writing, IonQ boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.",

Akanat Promphan, alongside Permanent Secretary of Industry Nattapol Rangsitpol, Acting Governor of the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand Sumet Tangprasert, and senior officials from the Office of Industrial Economics.\n\nThe discussions centered around AMCHAM\u2019s \u201cFive to Thrive 2025\u201d initiative, a strategic plan aimed at attracting and expanding foreign investment in Thailand. Key focus areas included incentives for workforce upskilling, technology and knowledge transfers, and sustainable green projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister Akanat emphasized that the Ministry\u2019s policies are already aligned with AMCHAM\u2019s goals. He highlighted two key legislative efforts: the Solar Installation Bill, designed to accelerate Thailand\u2019s transition to renewable energy, and the Industrial Waste Bill, aimed at transforming the manufacturing sector by promoting circular economy principles.\n\nAnother major topic of discussion was Thailand\u2019s plan to develop a recycling-focused industrial estate, which supports the country\u2019s net-zero emissions goals while maintaining economic competitiveness.\n\n\n\nReaffirming its commitment to Thailand\u2019s industrial growth and innovation, AMCHAM expressed its support for the Ministry\u2019s sustainable development agenda. \u201cAMCHAM also assists the Thai Government in enhancing the ease of doing business to attract more foreign direct investment,\u201d stated AMCHAM Vice President Ornkanya Pibuldham.\n\nThis collaboration marks a significant step in strengthening public-private partnerships to drive economic sustainability and industrial transformation in Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Whether you\u2019re an allergy sufferer, you live in an area of high pollution, or you simply want cleaner, fresher air in your home, one of the best air purifiers can make all the difference.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered with allergies my entire life, and I just couldn\u2019t put an end to my daily congestion. Relying on over-the-counter medication was equal parts frustrating and expensive, and I knew that I needed a better solution. I was initially skeptical about how much an air purifier could really help. However, four years later and, my dear reader, you can officially consider me a convert.\n\nWhen I initially brought my air purifier home, I started out by turning on its \u2018Sleep Mode\u2019 an hour before I went to bed. I was surprised that it only took a matter of days for my morning sniffles and sneezing fits to begin to improve. After just a week, I could actually breathe easily in my own home.\n\nI\u2019ll never underestimate how much of an impact an air purifier can have on health and wellbeing again, but it\u2019s important to note that not all air purifiers are created equal.\n\nLuckily, we\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours testing air purifiers in both house and laboratory settings to find the best option for your home.\n\nIf seasonal allergies, dust or pollution are your main concerns, you\u2019ll want an air purifier that focuses on fast filtration. If you\u2019re looking to cover a large amount of space, then you\u2019ll need to ensure that you\u2019ve selected a product that\u2019s designed to do so (air purifiers will have suggested room sizes, so make sure to check this before making your purchase!).\n\nFind out which of our 5 best air purifiers made the cut.\n\nMy top picks\n\nHow to choose the best air purifier\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nBefore buying an air purifier, there are several things to first consider. To help you decide on the best air purifier for your home and needs, we break down the key factors:\n\nWhat do you need your air purifier to do? To find the best air purifier for your needs, we need to know what you need your air purifier to do and where you plan to use it. Always check the CADR: Do you suffer from seasonal allergies? Are you a pet parent or have children? Or do you want to simply remove cooking smells, smoke or other odors? Check the CADR (clean air delivery rating) to determine which model is best for you. Essentially, the CADR measures how quickly an air purifier can filter the air in a given space, based on scores for smoke, pollen and dust. If your No1 priority is beating allergies or if you live in an area with high pollen count, we'd recommend looking for air cleaners with a high pollen CADR. However, if it's just general dust, then a standard rating will be sufficient. Some, such as the Mila Air Purifier, comes with seven, interchangeable filters to suit specific \"breathing\" needs such as the \"Big Sneeze\" and \"The Basic Breather\". Check the size of the room it's going to purify: Knowing what size air purifier you need for your room can often be confusing. Do you want to mainly filter a large living room or kitchen/dining space, or do you need it for a small nursery? Matching your air purifier to your room square footage and type is essential for it to work at its best. A general rule of thumb is to choose an air purifier with a CADR that is at least two-thirds the size of the room. For kids bedrooms or small home offices, the Shark NeverChange Air Purifier is an eye-catching, neat countertop unit. How easy is it to move?: Portability is another factor to consider, and air purifiers can be hefty appliances. From experience, you don't want to be doing the back-breaking task of carrying up and down stairs. Decide whether you're going to leave it in one room, or move it from room-to-room frequently. If so, check the weight of your air purifier to make sure it's easily moveable and not too heavy. Some air purifiers come with caster wheels or a carry handle to make it more portable. How noisy is it?: If you or family members value peace and quiet, you'll need to check out the air purifier noise levels (dBs). Noise levels range from nearly silent to steady humming, like an AC unit. If noise levels are a deal breaker, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto is a quieter device. What extra features do you need?: Besides the basic functions, it's worth checking any advanced features you might need. Does it have handy filter indicator lights? How useful is it giving real-time information? Or does it have programs or LED lights? If you need it for a child's room for instance, we'd suggest getting an air purifier with dimmable LED lights, so not to disturb their regular slumber. Personally, I would recommend a model with a remote control. I found it so handy to operate my air purifier from anywhere in the room, especially at night without having to get out of bed. Or if you prefer App control, we loved the Mila Air Purifier for it's super App and options.\n\nCynthia Lawrence As Homes Content Editor for Tom's Guide, Cynthia has made it her mission for us all to have cleaner homes (and air!) without the fuss. This comes after purchasing her air purifier four years ago, to combat insufferable hayfever and dust allergies. After just a week of using in her home, she was able to breathe easier again. Beyond that, she has a wealth of experience testing various appliances, and cleaning hacks. From finding the best air purifiers and vacuums to wet and dry mops, she probably has one of the most spotless homes around.\n\nThe best air purifiers you can buy today\n\nBest overall\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Steven Asarch/Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Steven Asarch/Tom's Guide)\n\n1. Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto The best air purifier for most households Our expert review: Specifications Dimensions: 20 x 13 x 13 inches Weight: 12.5 pounds Suggested room size: 550 square feet Filters: Particle/carbon/HEPASilent CADR (smoke/dust/pollen): 353/347/380 Speeds: Three speeds and an auto mode Noise level (dB): 35.6/60.8 Energy use (24 hours): 0.159 kWh Warranty: One year Today's Best Deals View at Newegg (White) View at Amazon View at Amazon (White) Reasons to buy + Cleans air efficiently + Uses power well + Great for large spaces Reasons to avoid - Larger footprint - Night mode lacks power\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally In a nutshell Attributes Notes Rating Price At $300, this air purifier is mid-range in the market price. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Design Cube-like, modern style. Offers the basics, but lacks smart features \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Performance Top of the class \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ease of use Straightforward and user friendly \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto stood out above the rest, proving to be a mighty air purifier. Out of all the models we tested, the Blueair Blue scored the highest CADR (clean air delivery rating) for getting rid of dust, pollen and smoke particles in bigger spaces. For that reason, I would recommend this for most households with large living rooms, bedrooms or spaces.\n\nDesign-wise, it's easy on the eye, with a cube-like style, although it is quite weighty to lift and move around. What's more, you can change the skirt on the lower half of this air purifier to a different color should you wish to suit your decor. It also boasts three fan speeds, an auto function, and a handy night mode for bedtimes . Although we did find the power on this setting disappointing, as it didn't seem any quieter than on the standard, fan levels.\n\nIn any case, we loved the fact that it was extremely easy to use with one button to cycle through every setting, and its intuitive, real-time display. If you want to see exactly how dirty your air is, it shows three colors (blue, yellow, and red) to detect the quality of air in the room.\n\nPerhaps, the only downsides were it's quite heavy to carry, and we found the the night mode to be a bit weak and ineffective. It also doesn't come with an App or smart features. But if this is a priority, we rated the Mila air purifier for having great App capabilities\n\nHowever, I don't necessarily think these are real deal breakers. If you're just after a powerful air purifier that can easily tackle any space, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is a great overall pick for everyday use.\n\nRead the full Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto review\n\nBuy it if\n\n\u2705 You want a powerful air purifier: The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto beat the competition, scoring an average CADR of 360 across dust, smoke and pollen \u2014 the highest rating of those tested.\n\n\n\n\u2705 You want handy features: Simple to operate, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto is also packed with enough features to suit everyday operation, including three fan speeds, an auto mode and a night mode.\n\n\n\n\u2705 You want to customize your air purifier: The skirt on the lower half of this air purifier comes in several colors, including pink, blue, green and gray, so you can customize it to suit your d\u00e9cor.\n\nDon't buy it if:\n\n\u274c You\u2019re tight for space: This air purifier measures 20 x 13 x 13 inches and weighs 12.5 pounds, so it's a hefty design which will take up some room.\n\n\n\n\u274c You want a strong night mode: Night mode effectively dims the lights on the unit and slows the fan down to reduce noise, but I found it to be on the weak side, so you might end up running the standard settings.\n\n\n\n\u274c You value quiet time: While the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto runs quietly at its lowest setting, it's among the noisiest at its fastest setting. It\u2019s not particularly noisy on the whole, but this is something to be aware of.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto will suit most households. It\u2019s a substantial air purifier, and offers first-rate air purification capabilities alongside a premium and simple-to-operate design. There\u2019s enough settings to cover the basics, it's attractive, and can be customized to your liking.\n\nBest value\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\n2. Clorox Large Room True HEPA Air Purifier Best value if you're on a budget Our expert review: Specifications Dimensions: 19 x 10 x 10 inches Weight: 11.6 pounds Suggested room size: 320 square feet Filters: Pre-filter, HEPA, and carbon CADR (smoke/dust/pollen): 206/219/232 CFM Speeds: Three speeds and an auto mode Noise level (dB): 41/58.7 Energy use (24 hours): 0.036 kWh Warranty: One year Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (White) View at Wayfair View at Target Reasons to buy + Small + Color-coded display + Three-stage HEPA filtering + Efficient operation + Runs on automatic Reasons to avoid - No Wi-Fi or remote control - Low air flow compared to the competition - Three year warranty\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally In a nutshell Attributes Notes Rating Price Good value up front \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Design Plenty of settings \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Performance Great in small space \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Ease of use Easy-to-read controls \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nNow we all know that quality air purifiers are not cheap, and you might not want to splurge. However, if you're on a tight budget, but need a powerful unit, the Clorox Large Room True HEPA Air Purifier came up tops as a great, affordable option. We also liked the Clorox's small and neat design, that has a small footprint.\n\nAnd there's no better way to test an air purifier than after a renovation. Our tester, Brian, was impressed at how quickly the Clorox cut the dust levels significantly during his kitchen rebuild, and in his medium-sized, home office. In fact, he mentions in his review that he didn\u2019t need to dust the room as often, which is always a bonus!\n\nDespite its small price, it still comes with plenty of functions that make it easy to use. This includes clear indicators for fan settings, automatic operation, and an LED color bar to show the current particulate level.\n\nWith a touchscreen to control everything, ease of use couldn\u2019t be more obvious. Although, the only thing we felt was really missing is a remote control and App, which would have been handy. But if this is something on your wishlist, I'd recommend the Mila air purifier that comes with a fantastic App.\n\nAnother thing to consider about the Clorax is that while it's a budget price, the filters cost $49 each time, so replacing them could add up over time. Still, the Clorox is an excellent pick for under $150.\n\nRead the full Clorox Large Room True HEPA Air Purifier review.\n\nBuy it if\n\n\u2705 You want a compact design: This air purifier features a compact design which is ideal for smaller spaces. Measuring 19 x 10 x 10 inches and weighing 11.6 pounds, it\u2019s portable and easy to store as well.\n\n\n\n\u2705 You want value for money: Priced at $149, this air purifier offers excellent value for money. And, it's very energy-efficient. However, replacement filters are a somewhat pricey $49.\n\nDon't buy it if:\n\n\u274c You need something to suit a large room: Despite its name, this air purifier works best in rooms up to 320 sq. ft., so it\u2019s likely unsuitable for larger bedrooms or living rooms.\n\n\u274c You want to control it remotely: To cut some corners, this model does not come with a remote control or smart home connectivity, but Clorox offers higher-priced models with these features.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Clorox Large Room True HEPA Air Purifier is the answer if you need an air purifier at an affordable price. It\u2019s more than capable of adequately cleaning medium-largish rooms. Plus it offers all of the settings you need, including an auto function.\n\nBest for large living rooms\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Steven Asarch/Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Steven Asarch/Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Steven Asarch/Tom's Guide)\n\n3. Honeywell HPA300 Best for a large room Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Dimensions: 22.3 x 20.0 x 10.8 inches Weight: 17 pounds Suggested room size: 465 square feet Filters: HEPA filter and activated carbon pre-filter CADR (smoke/dust/pollen): 300/320/300 Speeds: Four speeds Noise level (dB): 41/59.6 Energy use (24 hours): 1.002 kWh Warranty: One year Today's Best Deals Check Amazon View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Strong performance + Cheap replacement filters + Easy to use Reasons to avoid - Noisy - High energy consumption - No auto mode\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally In a nutshell Attributes Notes Rating Price Great price but high energy use \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Design Adequate but no auto mode \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Performance Strong but poor energy ratings \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Ease of use Intuitive \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nDo you have a large living room, kitchen or family space that is often dust-ridden or full of lingering smells? Open-plan living is the norm for many homes, and I know first-hand the perils of trying to get rid of cooking odors or cleaning sprays.\n\nAlthough not the most stylish, the Honeywell HPA300 is a robust air purifier that gave a strong performance in our tests. And while it scored slightly better on dust, it did well to filter smoke, odors and pollen in a large space.\n\nDon't expect fancy mod-cons though, as it only comes with four different fan speeds (including a turbo mode), as well as a timer for up to eight hours. We were also disappointed that there is no auto mode, meaning you'll have to manually change the fan speeds.\n\nHowever, the Honeywell was a breeze to use, with the exception of replacing the HEPA filter (that was a little tricky at first). It has a touch-based control panel and a quick reference guide to remind you of the basics. I'd say this would be perfect for non tech-savvies or those new to air purifiers.\n\nIt's also reasonably priced, from $150, and has cheap replacement filters, which is always handy for long-term costs. But this does come at a price. In our tests it was was pretty noisy on the loudest setting, which might not bode well if you value your peace and quiet. In which case, you might want to opt for the Blueair HealthProtect 7470i (48dB) that was significantly quieter.\n\nStill, if you want amazing results to tackle large, family rooms, the Honeywell HPA300 won't disappoint.\n\nRead the full review: Honeywell HPA300\n\nBuy it if\n\n\u2705 You need to cover a large space: This air purifier will suit rooms of up to 465 sq ft, which is pretty sizable.\n\n\n\n\u2705 You want good value for money: Considering its price of $150 and the capacity of 465 sq ft, this air purifier is excellent value for money. Plus the replacement filters only cost around $40.\n\n\n\n\u2705 You want something simple to use: The touch-based control panel on top of this air purifier is very easy and intuitive to operate. Plus there\u2019s a quick reference guide included to help get you started.\n\nDon't buy it if:\n\n\u274c You want an auto mode: This air purifier lacks an auto mode, which means it will stick to whatever fan speed you set it to, rather than adjusting based on the quality of the air. That means you could be using more or less power than is actually necessary.\n\n\u274c You want to save on energy: The Honeywell HPA300 consumed a lot of energy during my tests \u2014 using 1.002 kWh over 24 hours on the standard setting.\n\n\n\n\u274c You like peace and quiet: This air purifier is quite a noisy operator, producing some of the loudest decibel readings in my tests on both the lowest and highest settings (41 and 59.6dB).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Honeywell HPA300 might not be the prettiest to look at, but it\u2019s straightforward to operate and will get the job done. Just keep in mind there\u2019s no auto mode, and it\u2019s not ideal in terms of noise or energy consumption.\n\nBest for small spaces\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally In a nutshell Attributes Notes Rating Price Reasonably priced but filters are expensive \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Design Compact and attractive design \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Performance Good performer in mid-sized rooms, very intuitive \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Ease of use Easy set-up and real-time data, however no carry handle \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nAir purifiers can be bulky beasts, and if you live in a small apartment or need it for a tiny space, you'll probably wouldn't want an eyesore in the room.\n\nAt first glance though, the Shark NeverChange looks more like a small kitchen appliance than your average air purifier. And if you're space-limited, it's compact design will fit into any snug room or look attractive on a desk or side table.\n\nDespite its small stature (15 inches tall), it boasts some great features that we love. Mainly for its easy-to-use, touch controls, five settings and a stylish, ring light indicator that goes from blue (good air) to red (bad air). We also liked that it comes with an odor neutralised that will leave your home smelling fresh, which is always a bonus.\n\nPerhaps it's main selling point (and as the name suggests) is its five-year filter, which will save you on buying costly replacement filters in the long-term.\n\nWe tested this in several small-mid-sized rooms, and impressed by its top performance around the home. It notably ramped up in our tester, Linda's, kitchen/dining area, doing a grand job at filtering cooking odors within just one hour. This high range was also consistent when removing dust and pollen levels in the snug, living room area, and child's bedroom in minimal time.\n\nWhile we enjoyed its ease of use and performance, there were a few caveats. It's surprisingly heavy (at 7.2 pounds), and doesn't come with a carry handle. Another gripe is that you'll need to purchase a remote control separately, and there is no App. However, if you prefer convenience, you could opt for the Mila air purifier that comes with a great App.\n\nIn any case, it was the quietest model that we tested by far on the lowest setting (38 dB(a)) \u2014 measuring in line with a \u2018quiet rural area\u2019. Personally, I'd favor a quiet air purifier over mod-cons any day.\n\nIf you're after a compact size or have a small room like a nursery, the Shark NeverChange air purifier our top pick.\n\nRead the full review: Shark NeverChange air purifier.\n\nBuy it if\n\n\u2705 You want a compact yet powerful air purifier to cover mid-large rooms. It also exceeded the recommended 650sq ft max per room during our tests.\n\n\u2705 You want a long lasting filter. It comes with a NeverChange filter that lasts for 5 years, based on 12 hours use (on max power), per day.\n\n\u2705 You want intuitive features, settings and easy-to-understand, real-time readings. It comes with a LED ring light that changes from Blue (good air quality) to Red (poor air quality).\n\nDon't buy it if\n\n\u274c You have a lot of stairs or need to carry it around often. It is fairly heavy, and lacks a carry handle.\n\n\u274c The remote control is available at an extra cost, so bear that in mind.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Shark NeverChange air purifier may not have all the mod-cons, but it gave impressive results with the air quality, offers useful data, and is relatively quiet. It's ideal if you don't have much floor space, or if you want something that looks aesthetically appealing.\n\nWhat's more, you won't need to worry about replacing the main filter anytime soon, with its promise of five years. Which makes it value for money in the long-term.\n\nToday's best Shark NeverChange Air Purifier MAX deals $329.99 $249.99 View Deal ends Sun, Mar 23, 2025 $329.99 $299.99 View $400 View Show more\n\nBest for allergies\n\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Future/Tom's Guide) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future) (Image credit: Future)\n\n5.

This is thanks to Mila's seven interchangeable filters that you can easily swap out to suit your specific 'breathing' needs \u2014 and with quirky names too! For instance, The Rookie Parent, for little ones or The Basic Breather - for daily needs. Making it ideal for all members of the family.\n\nDesign-wise, the Mila is certainly eye catching, and its curvy, modern style can fit into any decor style. We found it super easy to set up, and it has a handy LCD display, remote control and a very good App. Other great features include a room presence sensor that detects when a human is in the room and adjusts it's noise accordingly. Pretty impressive if you don't want to be disturbed.\n\nDespite its small appearance, the Mila Air Purifier, made quick work of removing various airborne particles in our medium-sized living areas. Although, in larger rooms, that run time gets extended.\n\nThe only criticism is that it can be too noisy on a high setting - but this was only when the air was bad. However, if you did want a quieter purifier, or you don't want to disturb anybody's slumber, you can opt for the quieter Blueair HealthProtect 7470i .\n\nEssentially, the Mila is a great choice for families, allergy sufferers or anyone who simply wants a good-looking air purifier in their home.\n\nRead the full review: Mila air purifier.\n\nBuy it if\n\n\u2705 You want a powerful yet stylish air purifier that looks great in any room, without being an eyesore.\n\n\u2705 You want a user-friendly App that communicates important information in easily digestible messages and data delivery charts.\n\n\u2705 You want fast operation and a variety of seven filters to choose from, depending on your specific requirements. These offer different levels of filtration for various types of airborne particles.\n\nDon't buy it if\n\n\u274c You want a super quiet operation when the machine is on high.\n\n\u274c You're looking for affordability, the different filters can be expensive in the long-run\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Mila Air Purifier is a powerful, fast performer and ideal if you don't have much floor space. Those with allergies will benefit from the exchangeable filters to tailor your needs, and it has one of the best App control we've tested. If you care about aesthetics, its stylish design can suit any room.\n\nAlso tested\n\nWhile we put plenty of air purifiers through extensive testing, not every model made the final cut, despite doing a decent job.\n\nHowever, if you're still looking for an alternative to suit your needs or budget, check out the air purifiers below.\n\nBlueair HealthProtect 7470i: at Amazon If you're after a powerful, smart purifier, this Blueair came tops in all our tests. Simply use with remote control via an app, and there's a useful LCD screen built into the device itself. In fact, the only letdown is it's incredibly heavy weight, even with wheels. A good contender otherwise. Read the full review: Blueair HealthProtect 7470i\n\nDyson Purifier Hot+Cool\u2122 HP07 Air Purifier\n\nThe Dyson Purifier HP07 Air Purifier was dethroned by the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto as the best overall, but it's still got a lot of great features. Not only does it cool down the room, but offers top notch heating and state of the art design. It also comes with App control and real-time reports. As with most Dyson products, it comes at a hefty price, however, if you want a high-spec purifier, and unique style, this is a good buy. Read the full Dyson Purifier Hot + Cool HP07 review.\n\n\n\nDreo Air Purifier Tower Fan MC710S\n\nThe Dreo Air Purifier Tower Fan seemed promising, but fell short due to its lack of charcoal filtration to remove odors and its very low CADR rate. However, the features that we did rate it for included its huge air flow, vertical design and handy, app control. Read the full Dreo Air Purifier Tower Fan MC710S review.\n\n.\n\nWinix 5500-2 5500-2 Air Purifier: at Amazon This air purifier stands out for featuring \u201cPlasmawave\u201d technology to tackle any unwelcome airborne particles. It also comes with a useful remote control. However, it fell short in our tests for loud noise levels when running on high, and expensive filters. Read the full Winnix 5500-2 review.\n\nCoway Airmega AP-1512HH: at Amazon Small and compact in stature, this air purifier comes with a useful eco setting which will keep energy costs low. Despite it's energy efficiency, it fell short due to its loud noise levels and hefty weight. Read the full review: Coway Airmega AP-1512HH\n\nHow we tested the best air purifiers\n\nIn-home testing\n\nWe first put our air purifiers to the home test to compare the design and ease of use of each in a real world environment. For instance, how well can it cope with smoke, dust, pet dander and lingering cooking odors.\n\nTo figure out the noise output, we used a decibel meter and ran the purifiers at a set distance of three feet away on both the lowest and highest possible fan settings. And for energy usage, we hooked up each device to an electricity usage monitor and ran it for a full 24 hours. We also took an ambient room reading to make sure that the fan noise was not being overpowered by outside noise.\n\nTesting the Shark NeverChange air purifier with smoke (Image credit: Future)\n\nOther factors we considered included overall set up, cord length and whether the model oscillates. With all of this, we were able to create a scoring system to summarize the overall experience.\n\nTesting the Shark NeverChange air purifier in living room (Image credit: Future)\n\nLaboratory testing\n\nIf a CADR rating was not supplied by the manufacturer, we sent it off to a lab to get our own rating .\n\nWe used SGS IBR Laboratories to calculate the CADR for each pollutant by sealing the air purifier into a test chamber and then immersing with tobacco smoke, dust or pollen at a controlled rate. Each particle test would be conducted two times \u2014 once with the air purifier switched on and once where it\u2019s powered off.\n\nIn the real world, the standard goal is to clean a full room\u2019s worth of air in 15 minutes. So, for instance, a 300-square-foot room would need an air purifier with a CADR of 200 or so, assuming ceilings were 10 feet. That's why it's so important to get the right purifier for your room size if you want to see (or smell) the best results.\n\n(Image credit: SGS IBR Laboratories)\n\nDr Simon Harkis SGS Filtration Laboratory Manager UK \"What makes a good air purifier in my opinion is striking the balance between utilising a filter (or series of filters / filtration mechanisms) that have good removal efficiency for contaminants in the air that we breathe, whilst allowing for high airflow through the air purifier.\"\n\n(Image credit: SGS IBR Laboratories)\n\nMeet our testers\n\nIntroducing you to our trusted team who have spent countless hours testing the best air purifiers in their homes, so you don't have to!\n\nDan Cavallari Dan Cavallari is our freelance reviewer who tests large home appliances, outdoor grills, electric bikes, and more.

If you suffer from allergies, or don't have access to an air purifier, there are other things you can do to reduce dust in your home. Things such as dusting regularly, or vacuuming with one of the best vacuum cleaners can help. It's also recommended to wash your bedding every two weeks, remove footwear at the front door to prevent you from bringing dust around the home and invest in a 'waterhog' mat to catch dust. If you want to know the quality of your air, it's always worth investing in a smart air quality monitor. Such monitors gives you detailed reports about a room's air quality as well as trigger automations, based on a 100-point scale.\n\nCan you use an air purifier with the windows open? Air purifiers work most effectively when the windows are closed. By closing the windows, outside pollutants are kept out and won\u2019t affect the effectiveness of the air purifier \u2014 helping to extend the life of the HEPA filter. If you need to ventilate your room, Smart Air recommends opening your windows for 15-20 minutes to allow the air in the room to be refreshed. Once the doors and windows are closed the air quality will quickly return to the safe range when the purifier is in use. If you\u2019re concerned about the quality of your air, you can purchase an air quality monitor to measure your indoor PM2.5 levels.\n\nWill an air purifier remove odors? An air purifier will clean the air and remove odors, unlike candles and scents that mask the smell. The best air purifiers to remove smells use activated carbon filters to eliminate substances that include gases, chemical toxins and odors. Other types of filters, such as HEPA filters, are less effective in removing odors than they are in eliminating pollution particles.\n\nWill an air purifier remove dust? Similarly, an air purifier can help to remove active dust particles in the air, thus, reducing the amount of dust in your living space. This is because air purifiers are designed to capture and trap dust particles via its filter. High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are widely known for their effectiveness in capturing small particles. According to experts, such filters are capable of removing up to 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns in size.",

            "content": "Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $9.92 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

Now that hydrogen is a recognized alternative fuel, it needs to be produced, stored, and transported with efficiency. As the globe attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackles the complicated issues presented by climate change, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have become increasingly important in the world energy scene. But because these sources are essentially erratic-they only produce power when the sun or wind blows-they require greater capacity to offer a steady supply of energy. This intermittent nature seriously threatens the power grid's stability and dependability. Moreover, it makes it easier to smoothly incorporate more renewable energy into the system since excess energy may be stored for use when the amount of renewable energy produced is lower.Challenges:Hydrogen liquefaction processes are currently inefficient, with a thermodynamic energy efficiency of just 30-35% in the hydrogen liquefaction system market. It is a significant drawback because this inefficiency contributes to high costs when it comes to making hydrogen fuel. This makes it more difficult for hydrogen to be used on a larger and more cost-effective scale. However, with many shortcomings come many opportunities for improvement. For example, using cheap power sources like gas or steam turbines, optimizing thermal management, utilizing ortho-para hydrogen converters, improving inter-cooling and insulation, and automating boil-off control can all help significantly improve its energy efficiency. However, several challenges could hold back growth in the market for hydrogen liquefaction systems, including high initial investment costs for large-scale projects and competition from conventional technologies such as fossil fuels or nuclear energy.Regional Trends:The APAC hydrogen liquefaction system market is expected to register a major market share in terms of revenue and is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future.

We started by looking for safes with maximum temperature ranges above 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit with at least 30 minutes of fire protection.\n\nFrom there, we considered construction. Does the safe have a live locking bolt? How many? How are the hinges designed? (Exposed hinges are easy to break into.) How many layers make up the fire protection? (It often takes several layers of materials, including thick steel, to stop high temperatures from damaging valuables.)\n\nThe locking mechanism also played an important role in our choices. The locking mechanism should be secure enough to deter thieves, though fireproof safes are better at fire protection than protection from burglary. Safes with more than one kind of entry mechanism, like a combination lock with a key, also got higher marks from us. It\u2019s always good to have a secondary locking key in case of an emergency.\n\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Fireproof Safe\n\nFire and theft are at the top of most people\u2019s home security concerns. Some safes offer better protection from one than the other. Water damage is another issue at the top of many people\u2019s minds, and some safes offer some water resistance in addition to their other protective capabilities.\n\nUltimately, the items buyers want to protect and what or whom they want to protect them from help determine the right capacity, locking mechanism, and fire rating for a safe.\n\nType/Lock Mechanism\n\nKey lock: Plain and simple describes these locking mechanisms. However, keep track of the key. If it\u2019s kept in the room with the safe, it could get destroyed in a fire or be found by burglars.\n\nPlain and simple describes these locking mechanisms. However, keep track of the key. If it\u2019s kept in the room with the safe, it could get destroyed in a fire or be found by burglars.

Some mechanical locks also have a key lock to use in an emergency. However, buyers are more limited in the choice of combinations with a mechanical combination lock.\n\nThere\u2019s no key management involved with a mechanical lock combination, nor do users have to worry about a dead battery or electronic malfunction.

Electronic combination lock: These locks have more password options, and users don\u2019t have to worry about losing the key. However, some models need periodic battery changes. Like mechanical locks, an electronic lock may come with a backup key in case owners forget the code.\n\nThese locks have more password options, and users don\u2019t have to worry about losing the key. However, some models need periodic battery changes. Like mechanical locks, an electronic lock may come with a backup key in case owners forget the code. Biometric lock: Biometric locks use a fingerprint or retina scan to open the safe. There\u2019s no need to remember a code or keep track of a key. Some may have a key as a backup security measure.\n\nMaterial\n\nMost safes are made of thick steel sheets. The sheets, which can be several centimeters thick, give safes their hefty weight. However, these aren\u2019t just any sheets of steel. Safes contain plates made from both hard steel and mild steel. Heat can cause hard plates to crack, exposing the contents to hot temperatures. Mild steel warps rather than cracks, protecting the contents even as temperatures rise.\n\nFire safes are also constructed with a layer made of a nonconductive composite material that prevents the interior temperature from rising for 30 to 120 minutes. Fire-resistant insulation is also often used to help keep those interior temperatures down.\n\nHowever, steel isn\u2019t the only material used to make fireproof safes. ABS plastic and various resins are used as well. These two materials are lighter in weight and are typically used to make smaller, more portable safes.\n\nSize and Capacity\n\nShoppers will want to start their search for a fireproof safe box by making a list of what they want to keep inside it. If they have valuable jewelry or other irreplaceable items, a bank lockbox offers the best protection.\n\nPassports, birth certificates, Social Security cards, insurance policies, and tax returns are also valuable documents that could pose a problem if lost to theft or fire. Shoppers will want to take a look at their list and make sure the safe will hold everything on it. For example, firearms take up more space than documents or DVDs.\n\nSize also plays a role in where the safe can be placed. A fireproof wall safe or a large safe is harder to hide and easier to spot. To keep the safe hidden, consider a small fireproof safe that more easily fits in a closet, crawl space, or under floorboards. Keep in mind that small safes are vulnerable to theft if they\u2019re not hidden.\n\nUL and Fire Ratings\n\nIn truth, no safe is 100 percent fireproof. Safes are fire resistant only up to a certain temperature and for a certain amount of time.\n\nUL evaluates safes and gives them a fireproof rating. These ratings indicate two things\u2014the maximum temperature at which the product can maintain a safe interior temperature, and the length of time the safe can hold that temperature.\n\nThe interior temperature determines the kinds of materials the safe can protect. For example, the interior of a paper document safe shouldn\u2019t get hotter than 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything above that, and the paper will burn. However, electronics may not be able to withstand temperatures of more than 125 to 150 degrees.\n\nThe UL rating also indicates how long the safe can hold that interior temperature. Most home fireproof safes offer at least 30 minutes of protection. That may not sound long, but most fires move through a room in less than 20 minutes. For additional peace of mind, however, some safes offer up to 120 minutes of fire protection.\n\nWater Resistance\n\nWaterproof safes indicate how long they can protect their contents from water as well as the depth at which they can maintain that protection. Most resist water for approximately 24 hours, but some may offer up to 72 hours of protection in water that\u2019s 8 to 40 inches deep.\n\nIf living in a flood-prone area, it\u2019s a good idea to put the contents of the safe in waterproof bags, whether the safe is rated for water protection or not. Some safes also offer humidity resistance, which can protect items or documents that are sensitive to subtle environmental changes.\n\nUsability\n\nUsability features include display visibility, weight, and the safe\u2019s overall portability. LED displays are much easier to see in dim conditions. Considering that safes are often stored in dark, secure areas, a display that\u2019s easy to see will make the safe more functional.\n\nSome safes are portable with a top or side handle for easy carrying. These small safes may weigh 25 to 30 pounds. Others weigh more than 100 pounds and would take two people to move.\n\nWeight\n\nFireproof home safes can weigh anywhere from 20 pounds to hundreds of pounds. The ideal safe weight depends on several factors, including portability and intended location and use.\n\nIf portability is a concern, look for a lighter safe, weighing under 30 pounds. These safes will be easier to take along when traveling or commuting. They\u2019re also usually smaller and made to store items like USB drives, cash, passports, and other important documents that are necessary to have on hand.\n\nLightweight safes are easier to carry\u2014both for the user and a possible burglar. For larger or freestanding home safes, a hefty weight can work to the owner\u2019s benefit; it\u2019s harder for a robber to take off quickly with a safe that weighs hundreds of pounds.\n\nTips for Buying and Using a Fireproof Safe\n\nThe items shoppers want to protect, their available space, and the threats from which they\u2019ll want to safeguard their items will help them determine the right safe for them. Here are a few more tips to help find the best fireproof safe and incorporate it into a home security system.\n\nInstall the safe above ground level (not in a basement) to reduce the chances of water damage during a flood.\n\nThe first level of a multistory home offers the best protection from fire.\n\nSafes that come with a bolting system are designed to be attached to the floor or exterior wall for added security.\n\nDo not keep the safe in plain sight. As part of a comprehensive plan to keep a home and its contents secure, store the safe in a place that\u2019s inconspicuous or hidden.\n\nLook for a safe that\u2019s \u201cUL listed\u201d or \u201cETL verified.\u201d These labels indicate that they\u2019ve been tested by and passed third-party scrutiny.\n\n5 Things You Should Keep in a Fireproof Safe\n\nA fireproof safe is a good place to store important belongings that users want to keep at home, while a safety deposit box is best for really important items that they won\u2019t use often. A home safe will keep items protected but also within easy reach, in case users need to access or use the contents inside. Some items to store in a fireproof home safe include:\n\nImportant documents like insurance policies, bank and financial account information, legal documents, and medical documents\n\nIdentity documents like passports, birth certificate copies, Social Security cards, and other ID cards\n\nDigital data stored on USBs, CDs, DVDs, memory sticks, and hard drives\n\nCash and other small valuables like jewelry and collectibles\n\nFamily photos and other sentimental items\n\nFAQs\n\nQ. Will a fireproof safe survive a house fire?\n\nIt depends on the safe\u2019s level of protection. If the house fire does not exceed the safe\u2019s maximum fire-resistance time or temperature limit, it will survive the fire.\n\nQ. How can I be sure that I have a certified fireproof safe?\n\nLook for a UL-listed or ETL-verified safe; these safes have undergone trusted third-party testing based on design and performance standards.\n\nQ. Are all safes fireproof?\n\nNot all safes are fireproof. Some safes are designed specifically to deter theft, while others may protect from water damage rather than fire or theft. Some protect from all three. If you want a safe that protects from fire, you need to specifically look for one designed for that purpose.\n\nQ. What is the maximum temperature that my fireproof safe can withstand?\n\nIt depends on the safe, so look at the displayed specifications. Many fireproof home safes can withstand temperatures over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nQ. What is a UL fire rating?\n\nA UL fire rating comes from the Underwriters Laboratories and is a rating of temperature and time. This organization tests safes to determine the maximum exterior temperature at which the safe can hold a safe interior temperature and for how long it can maintain that temperature. Be sure to buy a safe that\u2019s \u201cUL listed,\u201d not \u201ctested to UL standards.\u201d The former means the safe has passed the UL tests, while the latter means the safe has been submitted but has not yet passed the safety tests.\n\nQ. What does \u201cETL verified\u201d mean?\n\nIntertek inspects and tests products for safety and gives an ETL verification for those that pass. Much like the UL, they test safes for fire and water safety. An ETL verification is also a good indicator of a safe\u2019s overall quality and safety.\n\nQ. Is my fireproof safe going to protect my papers if it is flooded?\n\nNot all fireproof safes have been tested against flooding, although many will offer some water protection. For reliable fire and flood protection, look for a safe that is both fireproof and waterproof.\n\nQ. What is the safest locking mechanism for a fireproof safe?\n\nChoose a safe with your preferred locking mechanism for ease of use and convenience; it\u2019s more important to consider the protection level rather than the lock type when it comes to fire safety. A fireproof safe that has been certified to a certain standard (for example, 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit for 60 minutes) will protect its contents from those conditions for the advertised time, regardless of the locking mechanism.\n\nQ. Where should I put my safe?\n\nThe size of the safe will narrow down your options. Look for a low-traffic area that\u2019s not easily seen or noticed. Someplace other than the master bedroom is a good choice since thieves usually start their search there.\n\nA guest bedroom or hall closet are good options. However, avoid the garage or basement. Garages tend to be left unsecured and are an easy target for thieves to carry away a safe. Water easily floods basements, making them a less-than-ideal choice.\n\nQ. Do thieves steal safes?\n\nDetermined thieves can steal and possibly open a safe despite complex locking mechanisms. A poorly made safe may open when dropped only a few feet, for example. The more deterrents the safe offers, the more likely thieves are to leave it alone. An audible alarm may be enough to scare off a jittery burglar.\n\nQ. How do I hide a safe in a wall?\n\nTo hide a wall-mounted safe, choose a concealed spot, such as behind a door, furniture, a mirror or painting, or in the back of a closet.\n\nQ. Should I bolt my safe to the floor?\n\nYes, bolting a safe to the floor offers extra security against theft.",

They work by creating a mist, through a heating element or a nebulizer with ultrasonic frequencies, to put moisture back into the air. They\u2019re especially helpful for those who live in dry climates.\n\nThe hydration that humidifiers provide can be helpful in a few different ways. Most people use them while they sleep to help with congestion. When your airways are hydrated, your body can more efficiently clear congestion, helping you breathe much easier while you sleep.\n\nYou\u2019ll also benefit from more moisture in the air if you deal with dry skin or dry hair. Humidifiers can work for small rooms, like bedrooms, or large rooms like general living areas. Be sure to pay attention to the square footage range the manufacturer specifies.\n\nVaporizer vs Humidifier\n\nVaporizers are a form of humidifier. Vaporizer is another word for a warm mist humidifier, because vaporizers work by boiling the water to produce water vapor.\n\nThere\u2019s no distinct benefit from using a vaporizer or warm mist humidifier over a cool mist humidifier. By the time you breathe in the mist, it\u2019ll be room temperature anyway.\n\nHowever, if your child needs a humidifier, I\u2019d recommend using a cool mist humidifier. The water in a vaporizer has to be boiled, so if the humidifier is knocked over while in use, it could harm your child.\n\nDiffuser vs Humidifier\n\nYou may think that because some diffusers work by producing steam, they do the same thing as a humidifier. This isn\u2019t necessarily the case. Diffusers work mostly by releasing an essential oil into the air. These are predominantly used for aromatherapy.\n\nMost humidifiers only produce a mist, and work to add moisture into the air. However, there are some humidifiers on the market that are intended to work as both a diffuser and a humidifier.\n\nBenefits of Using a Humidifier\n\nAs mentioned throughout this list, the major benefit of using a humidifier is having an optimal humidity level in your living environment. Experts agree that you should have a humidity level of 40-60%.\n\nWhen you have an optimal humidity level, your body is more likely to efficiently clear congestion. You\u2019ll also see benefits like less dry skin or dry hair.\n\nWhen to Use a Humidifier\n\nMost people turn to humidifiers in the winter months, when indoor heating can make homes quite dry. Winter is also when cold and flu season rolls around, and humidifiers can provide much-needed soothing to sore throats and stuffy noses. But really, humidifiers are great to use year-round.\n\nIf you live in a dry climate, having that optimal humidity level within your living spaces is great for your overall health. But if you live in a more humid environment, you might not need it all year, and will only need to use it when you\u2019re congested.\n\nHow to Use a Humidifier\n\nHumidifiers are generally easy to use. Most come with preset mist levels or have a simple dial that you set to either a low, medium, or high setting. Humidifiers come in all shapes and sizes. Some have top-fill water tanks, while others need to be flipped over to be filled.\n\nSome humidifiers come with auto shut-off features when the room has met an optimal humidity level, or if the water tank is empty. Most humidifiers, however, need to be manually turned off when you don\u2019t need them on anymore.\n\nBest Place to Put a Humidifier\n\nMany people use humidifiers in their room while they sleep. You can place them on a bedside table or on a dresser. Others use them for larger spaces like living rooms (if the humidifier has the capacity to fill up a space that large).\n\nRegardless of where you place it, it\u2019s recommended to keep the humidifier, at a minimum, 6\u201d away from the nearest wall. And if it has a directional nozzle, keep it pointed away from a wall.\n\nBecause it is water vapor, it will become condensation if it\u2019s that close to the wall, which could cause water damage to your home.\n\nHow to Clean a Humidifier\n\nMost humidifier manufacturers will have an instruction booklet that tells you how to clean its specific humidifier. It all depends on what your humidifier comes with and how many pieces there are.\n\nGenerally, you\u2019ll want to keep the water tank relatively dry when not in use, so do your best to rinse and dry the water tank when you\u2019re done with it. If you\u2019re using tap water, you\u2019ll likely need to descale your humidifier\u2019s water tank, too.\n\nThis process removes any residual minerals that were in the water. Some common descaling techniques include mixing equal parts water and distilled vinegar when you clean.\n\nOne way to avoid scale built up, or minimize the amount of scale left behind, is to use distilled water. Some brands will even mention that you should only use distilled water for a specific humidifier.\n\nThere are even some humidifiers that are dishwasher-safe, but this isn\u2019t the case for every humidifier. Again, thoroughly read through the instruction booklet the manufacturer provides.\n\nIf your humidifier comes with a filter, be sure to keep regular maintenance on that as well. If it has a disposable filter, you\u2019ll need to change them about once a month.\n\nFAQs",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.",

That will include 74 homes reserved as affordable housing, along with some 10,600 square feet of commercial and retail space that will help activate a vacant former industrial site on Route 440.\n\nThe gap financing award to Bayfront Partners 32 Urban Renewal, the developer, represents up to 60 percent of the total project cost.\n\n\u201cUnder Governor (Phil) Murphy\u2019s leadership, the Aspire program has supported meaningful development projects throughout the state, helping to expand housing options for New Jersey families,\u201d said Tim Sullivan, the EDA\u2019s CEO. \u201cBayfront Promenade will help revitalize the West Side of Jersey City and provide residents with affordable housing options and access to critical services.\u201d\n\nThe approval marks another key step for the long-awaited project, part of a multiphase plan for a 100-acre tract once owned by Honeywell Corp. The city acquired the waterfront parcel in 2018, with visions of creating the largest collection of affordable housing of any private, mixed-income community of its size in the country.\n\nThe project will also include amenities such as an outdoor terrace with grilling stations, a community lounge with a kitchen area, a coworking lounge, a fitness and yoga room, a dog washing station and a children\u2019s play area, the EDA said Friday. Additional plans call for a 21,000-square-foot covered parking garage with 52 parking spaces and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n\u201cThe Bayfront Redevelopment Project represents a transformative step forward for Jersey City\u2019s West Side, bringing much-needed affordable housing, vibrant mixed-use spaces and new opportunities for our residents,\u201d Jersey City Mayor Steven M. Fulop said. \u201cWith the support of the NJEDA\u2019s Aspire tax credit awards, we are turning vision into reality, building a stronger, more inclusive community that reflects our commitment to progress and equity.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s co-applicant is Greater Bergen Community Action Inc., which will provide services such as an on-site daycare center for residents and the surrounding community, according to the EDA. The nonprofit will also operate a credit union, providing banking services including savings and checking accounts and loan products and services.\n\nThe authority added that the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency is also supporting the project through an allocation of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. Additionally, the development will comply with the Energy Star Homes Program included in HMFA\u2019s green standard requirements, which satisfies EDA\u2019s own green building standards.\n\nOfficials noted that Aspire, which was created by the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, is a place-based economic development program to support mixed-use, transit-oriented development with tax credits to commercial and residential projects that have financing gaps. As a performance-based program, projects must certify that all commitments established at time of approval have been met before receiving their first disbursement of tax credits.",

            "content": "Honeywell Suono P2200 Review: Remember when we listened to music on old-school Sony Walkmans? The super-plasticky and extremely uncomfortable headphones were nowhere close to being an audiophile's delight. However, the tinge-y sound signature we got out of them was nothing short of studio-level finesse for our yet-untrained ears. Honeywell's new Suono P2200 brings back some of that magic. Extremely lightweight, they are way more comfortable and snug when it comes to fit. But, the TWS earbuds' clever use of environmental noise cancellation (ENC) and no-nonsense sound signature make the P2200 a great choice for those who want punchy earbuds without burning a hole in their pockets.\n\nHoneywell Suono P2200 Review: Quick Pointers\n\nWhat I Love:\n\nLong-lasting battery life (up to 54 hours)\n\nImpressive sound quality for the price\n\nClever ENC capabilities\n\nLow-latency gaming mode\n\nBluetooth 5.4 connectivity\n\nWhat I Don\u2019t:\n\nBass may be too deep for some listeners\n\nStellar Sound Quality, Gaming Mode\n\nThe Honeywell Suono P2200 earbuds boast dynamic audio with 6mm drivers in each earbud, delivering solid stereo sound that\u2019s sure to please most casual listeners. While these earbuds aren\u2019t going to rival high-end models in terms of pure sound clarity, they punch well above their weight for the price.\n\nThe bass, in particular, is deep and immersive \u2014 perfect for genres like pop, EDM, and rock. However, audiophiles who prefer a more balanced sound might find the bass a little overwhelming at times. Thankfully, there\u2019s no distortion at higher volumes, and the audio remains surprisingly clear for budget earbuds.\n\nFor example, when I listened to the new Twenty One Pilots album, 'Clancy' entirely, the easy-listening tracks such as 'The Craving', 'Snap Back', or 'Oldies Station' shone easily. However, when you get into complex layerings, in songs such as 'Paladin Strait', 'Routines in the Night', or even the highly charged 'Next Semester', an audiophile might certainly wish to listen on a more premium headset to truly get into the groove. However, at a throw-away price, the Suono P2200 does a decent job, especially in keeping distortion to negligible levels.\n\nFor gamers, the 40ms low-latency gaming mode is a big plus, though it may not compete with top-tier gaming headsets. Still, for casual mobile gaming or streaming, the lag-free experience is a welcome addition.\n\nComfortable Design, Powerhouse Battery\n\nAt just 1,799, the Suono P2200 earbuds are remarkably comfortable for long listening sessions. Their lightweight design ensures that they sit snugly in your ears without causing discomfort, even after hours of use.\n\nA big shoutout to the design of the charging case as well. Channelling true Marshall Minor TWS vibes, the faux leather looks are surely a headturner.\n\nBattery life is one of the standout features of these earbuds. You\u2019ll get up to nine hours of playback from a single charge, and the charging case extends this to a total of 54 hours. Whether you\u2019re commuting, travelling, or just enjoying your day, you\u2019ll have more than enough juice to last.\n\nPlus, fast charging via USB-C means you won\u2019t be waiting long to get back to your music or calls.\n\nENC Technology: Clear Calls, Clearer Music\n\nOne of the highlights of the Suono P2200 is its clever environmental noise cancellation (ENC) feature. Equipped with dual microphones, these earbuds reduce ambient sounds, ensuring that your calls come through crystal clear.\n\nWhether you\u2019re taking a ride in a raucous autorickshaw or working out in a crowded gym, the ENC helps filter out background noise, making your voice stand out more clearly.\n\nWhile ENC works wonders for calls, the passive noise isolation provided by the earbuds isn\u2019t as effective as active noise cancellation (ANC). They perform well in quieter environments but may struggle with louder settings.\n\nIf you're into sports or regular workouts, the Suono P2200 has you covered with its IPX5 rating.

            "content": "The latest trading session saw Honeywell International Inc. (HON) ending at $221.51, denoting a -1.84% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.29% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.32%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.5%.\n\nShares of the company witnessed a loss of 2.67% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Conglomerates sector with its gain of 3.5% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.52%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Honeywell International Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on February 6, 2025. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.37, signifying an 8.85% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $9.92 billion, showing a 5.08% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Honeywell International Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.92% lower within the past month. Honeywell International Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nDigging into valuation, Honeywell International Inc. currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.69. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 15.2.\n\nIt is also worth noting that HON currently has a PEG ratio of 2.59. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. HON's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.83 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 189, placing it within the bottom 25% of over 250 industries.",

            "content": "The Levoit Sprout is the company\u2019s first evaporative model that we\u2019ve tested, and we appreciated that nearly every part is dishwasher-safe (with the exception of the fan enclosure, which has electrical components). Unfortunately, it costs $190, and it left a roughly 10% difference in the relative humidity level across the room\u2014a result made more frustrating by the fact that it comes with a surprisingly accurate remote hygrometer.\n\nBy contrast, the Aircare Mantra ME440DGRY8 was much better at distributing the air around the room, but its onboard hygrometer was off by roughly 7% at any given time. Otherwise, this model was fine, but it\u2019s still too expensive to recommend.\n\nThe 6-liter Dreo HM713S is remarkably similar to our top pick, all the way down to the tank design and warm-mist capabilities. It performed decently in our tests, too, but it just didn\u2019t feel as nice as the Levoit models. The same goes for the slightly smaller Dreo HM512S.\n\nWe used to recommend the Vornado EVDC300, which provided great circulation along with all the other standard Vornado perks. But it wasn\u2019t as easy to clean as the EV3, and some readers complained about a decorative light in the tank that wouldn\u2019t turn off.\n\nThe Levoit OasisMist 450S Humidifier worked well enough but didn\u2019t offer anything to set it apart from our other Levoit picks.\n\nThe Carepod One is simple and sleek, and it\u2019s absolutely the easiest humidifier to clean of those we\u2019ve tested. Some manufacturing issues with the oscillation wand prevented us from making this model a pick in the past\u2014but even if that weren\u2019t a problem, this model would still be far too expensive.\n\nThe Canopy Bedside Humidifier is an attractive model with a lot of thoughtful design choices, all the way down to the packaging. But none of that can justify the hefty price tag, especially since the too-small tank has a too-small opening that makes it too hard to clean.\n\nThe Clorox Ultra Clean comes with a built-in UV light to help reduce any microbial growth that might pop up in the water, along with a three-year warranty. Unfortunately, in our tests it was only mediocre at the humidifying part of the job.\n\nThe Safety 1st Stay Clean Humidifier is another UV-equipped model, with just a single, simple-to-use dial to control the humidification level. But it offered lackluster performance in our tests.\n\nThe Dreo HM524S is a slightly larger version of our budget pick. It performed pretty well in our tests, but otherwise it failed to stand out beyond having an accurate on-board humidistat (a surprisingly rare occurrence).\n\nThe Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde PH04 performed decently as both a humidifier and an air purifier but not well enough to outshine our other picks, let alone to justify its massive cost (or size). We did appreciate its self-cleaning water tank, however.\n\nThe 1.5-gallon tank on the towering PureGuardian H3200WAR has two separate openings\u2014supposedly making it easier to fill in different-size sinks. Unfortunately, the tank doesn\u2019t sit flat either way, and neither fill hole is large enough to fit a hand through for cleaning.\n\nThe SPT SU-9210 Digital Evaporative Humidifier was our runner-up pick for many years, thanks to its reliably quiet evaporative performance. We still think it\u2019s a decent choice\u2014if you can find it in stock somewhere.\n\nThe top-filling Midea SCK-3Q60B has one of the worst on-board humidistats of all the models we\u2019ve tested. For some indiscernible reason, it also took a full minute to start up after we hit the power button.\n\nThe towering 10-liter Levoit OasisMist 1000S was the first Levoit model to really disappoint us. It was barely able to move the humidity more than 3 feet, leaving it to sit there in a puddle of its own making.\n\nThe fill hole on the Vicks V3900 is much too small for anyone to scrub the inside of the tank. It also might be too small for some people to get their hand back out after trying (which is how I ended up smashing it against the support beams in my kitchen to escape).\n\nThe Vicks VUL600 performed decently in our tests, but the tank was only slightly less frustrating than that of the V3900. At least I didn\u2019t have to smash this one. I just couldn\u2019t clean it, either.\n\nThe Carepod Cube X50 offers all the same perks and flaws as the original Carepod, with the bonus of warm-mist capability. Unfortunately, that feature doesn\u2019t actually do anything. After running for four hours on high during our testing, this humidifier raised the temperature of the water vapor by just 1 degree while consuming four times the energy.\n\nThe Elechomes UC5501 is a smart ultrasonic model that looks nearly identical to our top pick, the Levoit LV600S. Unfortunately, looks aren\u2019t everything, especially since this model has one of the worst humidistats and one of the slowest fans of any machine we\u2019ve tested.\n\nThe Lasko UH300 Quiet Ultrasonic is fine overall, though not particularly good in any way. It (over-)humidified the room a little faster than any of our Levoit picks. But the humidistat was about 10% off, and the fill hole on the 5-liter tank was too small for even my toddler to fit his hand inside. Pass.\n\nAlthough the Honeywell HUL430X is a streamlined and stylish-looking ultrasonic humidifier, it\u2019s frustratingly difficult to regulate or clean. It also has a tank that\u2019s sort of like a USB plug, in that no matter what you do, you always end up putting it in the wrong way the first time you try.\n\nThe Dyson Purifier PH03 Humidify+Cool is both a humidifier and an air purifier, and it performed well enough in our tests. But honestly, you\u2019re better off buying one of our humidifier picks, plus a separate air purifier; they would do both jobs better and still save you money.\n\nThe Vornado UH100 performed just as well as the models we like from Vornado. It was also the loudest ultrasonic model we tested, however, and it lacks the large capacity, the self-regulation, and the warm-mist capabilities that make the larger UH200 so appealing.\n\nA former budget pick, the Vicks V750 simply feels cheap in every sense of the word. On the plus side, it will continue working even after you accidentally snap a good number of the pieces in half during the cleaning process.\n\nThe Honeywell HCM-710 looks like a plastic casserole dish with a fan on top. And it was somehow both the quietest evaporative model we tested on medium and the absolute loudest on high. Worse, it sounds as if someone is leaning over your shoulder from behind and gurgling water in your ear.\n\nThis article was edited by Harry Sawyers.",

He added the additional role of chairman in June 2024.\n\nHe's now jumping headfirst into a complete overhaul of a company with roots in thermostats dating back to 1886. Honeywell has also built up through decades of acquisitions, starting with the 1999 merger with Allied Signal.\n\nAt a time when industrial conglomerates with economy of scale are no longer rewarded with high valuations, Kapur said in October 2024 that Honeywell would spin off its advanced material business. The new pubic company is slated to begin trading at the end of 2025 or early 2026. It boasts about $3.8 billion in annual revenue.\n\nApparently, that maneuver and promises of more weren't good enough for the activist community.\n\nHoneywell is reportedly planning to split into two independent publicly traded entities. One business would house Honeywell's automation division and the other its aerospace business. No formal announcement has been reached. This follows Honeywell saying in December it would explore the spin-off of its aerospace business.\n\n\"This is under review with the board, and during our earnings call [coming up], we have promised that we'll provide an update on that,\" Kapur said.\n\nThe company reports earnings on Feb. 6.\n\nHoneywell finds itself under pressure from feared activist investor Elliott Management, which has a stake of about $5 billion. The firm disclosed its investment in November.\n\nRead more: What Pete Buttigieg sees as the biggest infrastructure opportunity\n\nShares of the company are up 8% since late October. But Elliott may view the stock as lagging behind the market, with businesses that overlap. Honeywell shares are up 75% in the past five years, compared to a 144% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nJPMorgan industrials analyst Stephen Tusa estimates Honeywell could be worth $330 a share if broken up. The stock currently trades at about $223.\n\n\"This is a board that we believe has, and will continue to, fairly evaluate all value creation options and act accordingly so it\u2019s possible that the activist plan is followed through on,\" Tusa said.",

Let\u2019s dive into how it performed in real-world conditions.\n\nSpecifications Colour White Dimensions 26D x 26.3W x 52.4H cm Weight 5.5 kg Coverage Area 853 sq. ft (79 sq. m) CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) 550 m\u00b3/h Filter Type Pre-Filter, H13 HEPA, Nano Silver ION, Activated Carbon Noise Level 23 dB (Low speed) Power 50W, Corded Electric (220-240V) Features Wi-Fi & Alexa enabled, PM2.5 display, UV LED, Sleep Mode, App Control Filter Life Up to 9000 hours or 1 year Warranty 2 years\n\nFirst impressions Unboxing the Honeywell Air Touch P2, I was struck by its simple yet effective design. The device feels solid and lightweight, weighing just 5.5 kg, which makes it easy to move between rooms. At 26 x 26.3 x 52.4 cm, it\u2019s compact enough to fit in smaller spaces without taking up too much room. Its white finish is neutral and unobtrusive, making it suitable for any modern home decor.\n\nSetting up the air purifier was quick and easy. The real-time PM2.5 display gave immediate feedback on the air quality, and it didn\u2019t take long for the unit to show its value, especially in an environment plagued by high levels of pollution. The ability to turn off the display was another thoughtful feature, especially when using it in a bedroom, where light from the display could be a distraction.\n\nCheck out the product below:\n\nDesign and ergonomics The Honeywell Air Touch P2 is designed for practicality. It doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel but instead focuses on what matters: performance, ease of use, and portability. Its compact design means you can place it virtually anywhere, and at just 5.5 kg, it\u2019s light enough to move around without effort.\n\nDespite its relatively compact nature, the purifier can clean a large area of up to 853 square feet. It\u2019s easy to set it up in the living room and then shift it to the bedroom when needed. The top-mounted controls are intuitive, and the app connectivity ensures that you don\u2019t have to be near the device to adjust its settings. The ability to turn off the display, especially during the night, is a simple but thoughtful feature. It keeps the room dark for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep while continuing to clean the air.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a downside to the design. The power cord and plug feel flimsy and somewhat brittle. While this doesn\u2019t affect the overall performance, the quality of the wiring could definitely be improved for long-term durability.\n\nCheck out some more Honeywell air purifiers below:\n\nSound and performance When it comes to performance, the Honeywell Air Touch P2 shines. I tested it in rooms with varying levels of pollution, and it consistently delivered. In smaller rooms (around 150 square feet), the air purifier brought the AQI down to below 50 in less than 5 minutes, which is a huge relief, especially in cities with dangerous pollution levels like Delhi. In larger rooms (up to 500 square feet), it managed to lower the AQI in under 15 minutes, making it highly effective for most indoor spaces.\n\nThe real-time PM2.5 display provides immediate feedback, showing the gradual reduction in airborne pollutants as the air purifier gets to work. Its 4-stage filtration system, which includes an H13 HEPA filter, activated carbon filter, nano-silver ION anti-bacterial filter, and a pre-filter, works together to remove 99.99% of common allergens, dust, and pollutants. This is particularly important in areas where the air quality can get dangerously high, with PM2.5 levels reaching over 500 during peak pollution months.\n\nIn terms of specific pollutants like pet dander or tobacco smoke, the air purifier performed effectively, though it\u2019s worth noting that for severe VOCs (volatile organic compounds), a dedicated VOC filter might be more suitable.\n\nWhile the purifier works effectively, the noise level can be a bit higher when set to its highest speed. At low speeds, it\u2019s practically silent, making it ideal for use in a bedroom or office. At medium or high speeds, the noise becomes more noticeable, but it\u2019s still not disruptive, especially if you\u2019re not running it at maximum speed for extended periods.\n\nAir quality indicator and accuracy The real-time PM2.5 display on the Honeywell Air Touch P2 provides accurate readings of indoor air quality, helping you monitor the effectiveness of the purifier. The app adds another layer of functionality by showing outside pollution levels, allowing you to compare indoor and outdoor air quality in real time. During testing, the air quality indicator proved to be accurate, reflecting the changes in air quality as the purifier worked to clean the air. It\u2019s a useful feature for those living in cities like Delhi, where pollution levels can fluctuate throughout the day.\n\nAuto mode and smart features The Auto Mode adjusts the fan speed based on real-time air quality readings. While this worked efficiently in my tests, the purifier could take a little longer to ramp up to higher speeds when there\u2019s a sudden spike in pollution. The app and Alexa integration allowed for convenient remote operation, although there were occasional connectivity hiccups when connecting via the app.\n\nPower consumption and filter The Honeywell Air Touch P2 is corded and operates on just 50W of power, making it an energy-efficient solution for homes that run air purifiers for long hours. I didn\u2019t notice any significant rise in my electricity bill during the time I tested the unit. The filter life is also impressive, lasting up to 9000 hours or one year. The filter reset indicator serves as a helpful reminder to replace the filter, keeping maintenance straightforward and hassle-free.\n\nHowever, the plug and cord quality, as mentioned before, leave something to be desired. The wire feels a little too thin, which could make it prone to damage with regular handling. It would be better if Honeywell provided a sturdier cord that could withstand daily wear and tear.\n\nReasons to buy Fast purification, AQI drops below 50 in minutes Quiet operation at low speeds Lightweight and easy to move Effective 4-stage filtration Smart features: Wi-Fi, Alexa, real-time PM2.5 display Reason to avoid Power cord feels flimsy High-speed noise can be noticeable Requires filter replacement every year Click Here to Buy Honeywell Air Touch\n\nSome more air purifiers for you:\n\nShould you buy the Honeywell Air Touch P2 air purifier? The Honeywell Air Touch P2 is a reliable air purifier that can tackle hazardous air quality levels, especially during peak pollution months in India. With a fast air purification cycle, quiet operation at low speeds, and effective filtration, it\u2019s a great choice for homes suffering from poor air quality. The ability to bring AQI levels down to below 50 in a matter of minutes is especially beneficial in cities where pollution can be life-threatening.\n\nWhile the power cord quality and noise at higher speeds could use some improvement, the overall performance of the Honeywell Air Touch P2 makes it a solid investment. Whether you\u2019re dealing with city smog, allergens, or general indoor pollution, this air purifier delivers results that will help you breathe easier and healthier.\n\nSimilar articles for you",

            "content": "The year 2024 proved to be exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market rising over 23%. The Nasdaq outperformed with a nearly 29% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 rose close to 25%. These impressive gains were largely driven by the Magnificent 7 stocks, which surged by nearly 67%, along with other mega-cap companies. This marked the second consecutive year that the broader market achieved gains exceeding 20%, a feat last seen in the late 1990s.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study by Preqin revealed that institutions, including pensions, endowments, and foundations, hold $21 trillion in traditional diversified strategies, as of June 2024. These strategies allocate funds across various investments such as bonds, stocks, real estate, and cash.\n\nThat said, diversification doesn't guarantee a lack of correlation between your investments. For example, owning 100 tech stocks might reduce risk compared to holding just one, but those 100 stocks are likely to be correlated with each other. To truly minimize risk, it's important to diversify beyond just one sector. According to analysts, the higher yields on Treasury bonds could provide some protection in the event of a major stock market decline. Despite this, those who believe in diversification are facing uncertainty. US stocks continue to outperform year after year, driven by the consistent profits of American companies, making other investments seem like a path to underperformance.\n\n\"Through intelligent portfolio building and diversifying, investors can create a portfolio of risky assets with an aggregate volatility that is lower than any of the individual securities. The key here is to buy securities with attractive risk profiles that are not correlated to each other in a significant way with the goal that when one asset is performing poorly, another asset will pick up the slack through positive performance.\"\n\nDiversified stocks refer to companies involved in multiple sectors, industries, or regions. These businesses, often large conglomerates like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, generate income from a variety of operations. The main goal of diversification is to lower risk by spreading investments across various areas, reducing the potential negative impact of poor performance in any one stock or sector. Nathan Wallace, principal wealth manager at Savvy Advisors, also supported the idea of diversifying portfolio. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at some of the best diversified dividend stocks.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other diversified dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently sought comfort in dividend stocks. Among these, dividend growth stocks have gained significant interest. A report from BlackRock revealed that, over time, stocks that consistently increased or maintained their dividends have tended to perform better than those that didn't pay dividends or cut their payouts. In times of market decline, dividend-paying stocks often offer a safeguard against fluctuating share prices. Companies that pay dividends typically aim to sustain these payments and are usually hesitant to reduce them unless it's essential.\n\nWhen considering dividend stocks, investors typically assess the dividend yield. Experts suggest targeting yields between 3% and 6%, as yields higher than this could signal potential yield traps. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, has highlighted this advice. Below are some insights from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI generally like to advocate for an approach of targeting great businesses that might pay closer to a 3% to 4% dividend yield.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders. The list is ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nCramer Bullish on Honeywell (HON) Amid Activist Investor Stake and Aviation Spin-Off\n\nA shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) ranks fifth on our list of the best diversified dividend stocks. The American multinational conglomerate company recently made it to headlines as the company announced that it is moving forward with a breakup after facing ongoing pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, according to Bloomberg's David Carnevali. The industrial company intends to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, one focused on automation and the other on aerospace and defense. Sources indicate that Honeywell may officially announce the plans alongside its fourth-quarter earnings report, which is set for release in early February.\n\nBefore the separation takes place, let's review the company's performance in the third quarter of 2024. The company reported revenue of $9.73 billion, which saw a 5.6% growth from the same period last year. Segment profit rose by 6% compared to the previous year, driven by strong performance in Aerospace Technologies and the full-quarter impact of the Access Solutions acquisition. In addition, segment margin remained steady year over year at 23.6%, surpassing the upper end of the company's guidance range by 30 basis points.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) has grabbed investors\u2019 attention due to its strong cash generation. The company generated $2 billion in operating cash flow in the most recent quarter and its free cash flow came in at $1.7 billion, up 10% on a YoY basis.\n\nIn September 2024, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) declared a 4.6% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.13 per share. This was the company\u2019s 15th dividend hike in the past 14 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.03%, as of January 22.\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) grew to 55 in Q3 2024, from 50 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of more than $877 million.\n\nOverall HON ranks 5th on our list of the best diversified dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Spread the love\n\nExplainer: What\u2019s Behind the Volatility in Honeywell Flour Mills\u2019 Stock Price?\n\nIn recent days, Honeywell Flour Mills (HFM) has demonstrated remarkable volatility and a significant upward price movement in its stock, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike.\n\nFrom December 23, 2024, HFM\u2019s stock price surged from N6.65, reaching a high of N11.02 per share, before eventually settled at N9.70 on January 21, 2025, translating into 45.86%.\n\nThis price movement marked a substantial shift compared to its prior low of N6.19, raising questions about what factors are behind this rapid change in its market valuation.\n\nSeveral potential reasons have been adduced to explain this price increase. A key factor being discussed among investors and analysts is the delisting of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) from the Nigerian Exchange, given that FMN owns a significant 85.54% (direct or indirect) stake in Honeywell Flour Mills.\n\nThe delisting of FMN from the stock market, along with the company\u2019s substantial stake in Honeywell, has naturally sparked confirmation about the future ownership structure and control of HFM.\n\nThese led some to believe that the market is responding to potential corporate actions such as mergers, acquisitions, or strategic realignments.\n\nInvestors are particularly interested in how the removal of FMN\u2019s dominant holding might impact Honeywell\u2019s governance, future growth prospects, and stock value.\n\nHowever, this explanation may oversimplify the situation, as there are other factors to consider. Honeywell Flour Mills\u2019 strong product line, particularly its wheat flour, which is widely recognised as one of the best in the Nigerian market, has contributed to the company\u2019s reputation and stability in the food manufacturing industry. The quality of its products, alongside strong brand recognition and an established customer base, plays a significant role in fostering investor confidence.\n\nDespite external factors like the FMN delisting, Honeywell\u2019s solid market position in the wheat flour sector likely influences its stock price positively, as demand for essential food products, especially in an inflationary economic environment, remains robust.\n\nAdditionally, the wider economic environment in Nigeria, characterised by inflationary pressures and potential policy changes affecting the flour milling and agriculture sectors, could be contributing to a favourable sentiment towards Honeywell.\n\nAs consumers prioritise essential goods, companies like Honeywell Flour Mills that produce staple products such as wheat flour may be seen as relatively insulated from market downturns, thus boosting investor confidence and pushing the stock price higher.\n\nThe key question, therefore, for investors seeking clarity is: What is driving the current price movement of Honeywell Flour Mills? The answer likely lies in a combination of factors.\n\nWhile the FMN delisting and its potential impact on ownership structure cannot be overlooked, the intrinsic value of Honeywell\u2019s product line, its market positioning, and the broader economic environment all play critical roles.\n\nIt is clear that the market is pricing in a complex mix of corporate dynamics, product strength, and investor sentiment. For any investor, it is essential to assess these fundamental and external factors carefully, as they will influence the company\u2019s long-term performance and market valuation.\n\nThe ongoing volatility in the stock price suggests that the market may continue to react to shifting investor perceptions, making it important to monitor developments closely. #Explainer: What\u2019s Behind the Volatility in Honeywell Flour Mills\u2019 Stock Price?

            "content": "Quantinuum, a unit of Honeywell (HON), announced plans to open a new location in New Mexico. This anticipated site will support ongoing collaborative efforts to advance the photonics technologies critical to furthering Quantinuum\u2019s product development. Photonics, the science and technology of light, is essential to the advancement of Quantinuum\u2019s trapped ion quantum computing technologies, which use light to control and manipulate qubits, the company noted. New Mexico has established itself as a leader in quantum information sciences and the development of photonics and other enabling technologies. In July 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration, as part of its Tech Hubs program, officially designated Colorado, home to Quantinuum\u2019s U.S. Headquarters, and New Mexico as leading hubs for quantum information technology. \u201cI am thrilled to welcome Quantinuum to New Mexico, launching a new industry for our state that builds on our proud foundation of innovation,\u201d said New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. \u201cNo state is better positioned to transform the momentum of the quantum computing industry into major economic and entrepreneurial growth, and Quantinuum will be a groundbreaking partner in that work. Together we will leverage New Mexico\u2019s assets, including the groundbreaking work being done at our national laboratories and the nation\u2019s best quantum scientists being educated at our universities, to invest in and grow the state\u2019s quantum technologies industry, creating career opportunities for New Mexicans and continuing to build the technology of the future.\u201d Quantinuum\u2019s New Mexico location, anticipated to open later this year, is expected to create high-paying jobs and drive economic growth, the company said.\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

The case was marked FHC/L/20C/2025.\n\nThe defendants were accused of allegedly obtaining N12.3 billion from First Bank under false pretences.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Mr. Bode Olanipekun (SAN), representing Otudeko, informed the court that he was appearing \u201cin protest\u201d because his client had not been served the charge.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Olumide Fusika (SAN), announced his appearance for Onasanya, stating that his client was not served but that he was able to print a copy of the charge.\n\nFusika condemned the media trial his client had been subjected to, saying his client is not formally invited by EFCC or served a notice of the charge.\n\nHe expressed surprise at seeing news stories in major newspapers linking Onasanya to a trial on loan controversy during his time as First Bank Group Managing Director without prior notification.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, it is concerning that my client has been unduly exposed to media trial without being formally served. This is a procedural anomaly that undermines his right to a fair hearing and personal dignity,\u201d Fusika said.\n\nMr. Kehinde Ogunwumiju (SAN) appeared for Akintayo, while Mr. Charles Adeogun-Philips (SAN) represented Anchorage Leisure Ltd. and also protested, confirming that his client had not been served.\n\nConsequently, Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke questioned how all defense counsels could appear in court if the defendants had not been served.\n\nIn response, Olanipekun, counsel to Otudeko, pointed out that despite the media reporting on January 17 about the defendants\u2019 impending arraignment, no charge had been formally served on his client.\n\nHe presented some national newspapers clippings to support this claim.\n\nIn response, EFCC prosecutor, Mr. Rotimi Oyedepo (SAN), explained that multiple efforts had been made to serve the defendants at their last known addresses without success.\n\nOyedepo denied any involvement by EFCC in the media coverage of the case. He stated that the commission had not issued a press statement and suggested that journalists might have obtained information through other means.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, we disassociate ourselves from any media reports,\u201d Oyedepo said.\n\nThe second defense counsel, Fusika, then offered to accept service on behalf of his client, which the court approved. The prosecutor handed Fusika a copy of the charge in court.\n\nThe case was adjourned till February 13 for the defendants\u2019 formal arraignment.\n\nEFCC alleged that the defendants orchestrated fraudulent transactions totalling N12.3 billion in 2013 and 2014 in various amounts, and used forged documents to deceive the bank.\n\nThe charges included conspiracy to defraud First Bank, obtaining loans under false pretences, and money laundering activities involving the diversion and conversion of bank funds for personal use.\n\nThey were also accused of forging documents to mislead the bank into believing false credit facilities had been requested by companies like V-Tech Dynamic Links Limited and Stallion Nigeria Limited.\n\nThese actions violated several provisions of the Nigerian law, including the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud-Related Offences Act 2006, Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, and the Miscellaneous Offences Act.",

            "content": "Looking at Honeywell International Inc.'s ( ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net sellers. That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Honeywell International\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP & General Counsel, Anne Madden, sold US$4.9m worth of shares at a price of US$194 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$223, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 42% of Anne Madden's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Anne Madden.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nDoes Honeywell International Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Honeywell International insiders own about US$125m worth of shares (which is 0.09% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Honeywell International Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Honeywell International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Honeywell International.

She faced her lifelong battle with cancer with extraordinary courage and grace.\n\n\n\nMai was born Mai Phuong Ta on May 2, 1959, in Saigon, Vietnam, to mother Hoa Thi Dang and father Quang Van Ta. From an early age she excelled academically, with a particular love for mathematics and science, and displayed athletic talent as a track runner. A graduate of Regina Mundi Catholic School in 1977, Mai's early years were shaped by her resilience and deep devotion to family.\n\n\n\nAfter the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, Mai took on the role of caregiver, helping to raise her younger siblings Ngoc (Karen) and Nguyen (Christopher) while her older brother Trinh worked, her mother taught school, and her father endured a post-war reeducation camp. In 1979, with unshakable hope and determination, Mai and her family escaped Vietnam, spending a year in the Pulau Tengah refugee camp in Malaysia before immigrating to the United States on May 12, 1980. They settled in Minneapolis, where Mai began a new chapter of her life.\n\n\n\nMai attended the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, where she met the love of her life, Stephen MacLennan, in a Complex Analysis math class on March 31, 1982. She graduated in 1984 with a degree in electrical engineering and embarked on a distinguished career designing memory integrated circuits, working for Honeywell, LSI Logic, and Broadcom. Her groundbreaking work earned her five U.S. patents, and her family often proudly noted that Mai's contributions likely power devices we all use today. Known for her exceptional spatial reasoning and photographic memory, she navigated both complex semiconductor chip designs and cross-country road trips with remarkable ease.\n\n\n\nMai and Stephen married on July 7, 1984, beginning a partnership defined by unconditional love, mutual respect, and shared adventures. Their bond was tested early in their marriage when Mai was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia in 1985. Mai underwent a successful bone marrow transplant, with her brother Trinh as donor, at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Medical Center. Her remarkable recovery and her steadfast determination inspired all who knew her.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Mai faced a new health challenge with bladder cancer. She and Stephen moved from their longtime home in Plymouth to Rochester in early 2024, where they discovered a supportive and welcoming community. Despite her illness, Mai and Stephen savored a year filled with love, connection, and deep joy.\n\n\n\nMai will be remembered as a quiet yet profound presence whose warmth, generosity, and zest for life left an indelible mark on everyone she met. She found joy in cooking delicious Vietnamese dishes, eating healthfully, solving intricate puzzles, reading, traveling, and cherishing moments with her family and friends.\n\n\n\nMai is survived by her devoted husband of 40 years, Stephen MacLennan of Rochester, MN; her siblings Trinh Ta (Lien Truong) of Naperville, IL; Karen Ta (Kevin Nepsund) of Woodbury, MN; Christopher Ta (Kathryn) of Los Altos, CA; brother-in-law Don MacLennan (Diane) of Bloomington, MN, and sister-in-law Mary MacLennan-Sackett (Mike Sackett) of Edina, MN; along with many relatives and lifelong friends, including her cherished high school classmates, the Couventines. She is preceded in death by her parents, Hoa Thi Dang and Quang Van Ta.\n\n\n\nHer family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the exceptional teams at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic of Rochester, as well as medical staff in Edina and Wayzata for their compassionate care for over four decades. Mai often said she felt incredibly lucky, and those who were blessed to know her feel even luckier. Her legacy of resilience, kindness, and quiet strength will live on in the hearts of all who loved her.\n\n\n\nA memorial service to honor Mai's extraordinary life will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, July 12, 2025, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, 4439 West 50th Street in Edina, MN, with visitation prior beginning at 10 a.m.",

            "content": "Last Updated on:\n\nThe green hydrogen field is showing a spark of life following a rough patch last year. Some of that spark is coming from the aviation industry, which has been searching for sustainable aviation fuels to replace petroleum-base jet fuels. Various biobased SAF concoctions have appeared without achieving significant scaleup, and now hopes are being pinned on green hydrogen and the e-fuels field.\n\nGreen Hydrogen And E-Fuels\n\nE-fuels (aka electrofuels) represent a new direction for SAF. E-fuels are synthetic hydrocarbon fuels that are produced by combining captured carbon with green hydrogen, typically meaning hydrogen pushed from water in an electrolysis system powered by electricity from wind, solar, and other renewable resources. Biomass is another emerging resource, but, to date, much of the activity has focused on water electrolysis.\n\nHere in the US, an e-fuels gold rush of sorts has already surfaced in Texas, where American Airlines is collaborating on an e-fuel SAF initiative called Project Roadrunner, with the e-fuels stakeholder Infinium and other partners. CleanTechnica first took note of the project back in 2023, reporting that American Airlines contributed a firm offtake agreement help ensure the success of the venture.\n\nLast fall Project Roadrunner earned a seal of approval from the firm Brookfield Asset Management, which announced itself as a $200 million strategic funding partner with Infinium for the Texas project along with another $850 million in funding aimed at distributing Infinium SAF and other e-fuels globally.\n\nRoadrunner was still on track as of September 10, with American Airlines affirming that it expects to purchase SAF from the project in commercial-scale quantities beginning in 2026.\n\nMore Green Hydrogen For e-SAF In Denmark\n\nThe emerging e-SAF industry also got a shot of adrenaline last week, when the Swiss e-fuels firm Metafuels announced a new $9 million round of funding in support of a demonstration site in Switzerland. In anticipation of a successful demonstration, Metafuels also has a production facility in Denmark in the pipeline. The production facility is expected to generate 12,000 liters of SAF daily once in operation.\n\nThe firm Celsius Industries spearheaded the funding, with new investors RockCreek, Fortescue Ventures, and Verve Ventures also participating. Existing investors Energy Impact Partners and Contrarian Ventures signed onto the new round as well, having contributed to an $8 million funding round in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy chipped in another $5 million, based on Metafuels\u2019s sustainable methanal-to-SAF collaboration with the Swiss research institute PSI.\n\nMetafuels is playing its proprietary e-fuels process close to the vest, but the company does emphasize that its SAF is produced with electricity from renewable resources. \u201cMetafuels\u2019 differentiation is cost leadership through the ability to convert its feedstock (e-methanol) into e-SAF with a significantly higher yield, ensuring a more efficient and cost-effective process,\u201d the company adds.\n\n\u201cMetafuels\u2019 signature e-SAF, aerobrew, can replace conventional kerosene regardless of the size, type of aircraft, and short-haul or long-haul,\u201d Metafuels explains. The company\u2019s website provides just a bit of additional detail, describing the aerobrew process as an \u201can innovative catalytic system \u2014 the \u2018missing piece of the jigsaw\u2019 for converting green methanol to SAF \u2014 with a high selectivity and yield.\u201d\n\nIn a press statement announcing the new funding last week, Metafuels CEO and co-founder Saurabh Kapoor noted that the funding total of $22 million enables Metafuels to complete the demonstration program and focus on the commercial market. \u201cWe will be looking at implementing a number of new sustainable aviation fuel production sites and are already engaging with various stakeholders as potential investors or e-SAF off-takers,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s Gonna Pay For All This?\n\nThe big obstacle, of course, is cost. Metafuels is leaning on the efficiency and scalability of its aerobrew process to counterbalance the cost of green hydrogen, which remains high relative to conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas (see lots more green H2 background here).\n\nMetafuels also notes that its facilities can be located near aviation fuel hubs and competitive renewable energy resources, trimming transportation and electricity costs.\n\nHigh costs or not, legacy aviation stakeholders are also paying attention. That includes Honeywell, which was tapped by the Danish firm Power2X to contribute its new \u201ceFining\u201d system to a large-capacity eSAF hub taking shape in Rotterdam, aiming at delivering more than 250,000 tonnes (metric tons) per year.\n\n\u201cThe Rotterdam facility will use locally produced green hydrogen and imported methanol produced from green hydrogen and biogenic carbon as feedstock to create electrofuels (eFuels),\u201d Honeywell and Power2X explained in a press release dated December 17.\n\n\u201cHoneywell\u2019s eFining technology will play a central role in production, enabling the conversion of methanol into eFuels with low emissions and high efficiency,\u201d the two firms elaborated, adding that the Rotterdam facility \u201cunderscores how technology is shaping the future of aviation and the energy transition, two megatrends that align with Honeywell\u2019s portfolio.\u201d\n\nBefore you get too excited, the two companies also indicate that their eSAF will be blended with conventional jet fuel in order to achieve the status of a drop-in replacement. Nevertheless, they indicate that the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions will be substantial.\n\n\u201cHoneywell UOP eFining can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88% compared to conventional jet fuel,\u201d they state.\n\nHoneywell adds that its SAF technology has been licensed at more than 50 sites around the world, for a combined capacity of 500,000 barrels daily if and when they become fully operational.\n\nAnother Green Hydrogen Startup To Watch\n\nA quick search of the Intertubes easily reveals green hydrogen and e-SAF projects around the world that have been delayed or cancelled outright due to high costs and offtaker scarcity, Uniper\u2019s proposed \u201cSkyFuelH2\u201d project in Sweden being one example. However, that does not seem to have dampened enthusiasm in other locations. For example, the Sultanate of Oman is working with the Norwegian firm Nordic Electrofuel to turbo-boost e-SAF production in the Sultanate.\n\nKeep an eye on the Finnish startup Liquid Sun, which describes itself as a \u201ccarbon recoding\u201d company. \u201cOur solution is based on low temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that transforms CO\u2082 and water into valuable e-fuel feedstocks. The process is powered by renewable electricity,\u201d Liquid Sun explains.\n\nIn November, Liquid Sun reported that it has nailed down almost 4 million euros in seed funding, on top an an earlier \u20ac1 million funding round in 2023. With the funding in hand, Liquid Sun anticipates a smooth path towards scaleup.\n\nThe next step is a pre-commerical demonstration project, to be housed in a shipping container.\n\nThe new round of funding was spearheaded by Voima Ventures, which also has the green hydrogen stakeholder Solar Foods under its umbrella, and co-led by the Finnish-American venture capital firm Failup Ventures. The agricultural waste recycler Enifer Oy also participated, along with the Swedish firm Cellfion AB.\n\nFollow me via LinkTree, or @tinamcasey on LinkedIn and Bluesky.\n\nImage: Green hydrogen stakeholders anticipate hitching a ride on the up-and-coming e-SAF field, which leverages renewable electricity to produce synthetic fuels (courtesy of Metafuels).",

Jan. 2, 2025)\n\nOverview\n\nThe Federal Circuit reversed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s (the Board\u2019s) finding of non-obviousness, finding that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was based on the wrong legal standard.\n\nIssues\n\nWhether the Board\u2019s finding that a person of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to swap the last two bits of the Philips reference was supported by substantial evidence. Whether the Board committed legal error by going beyond the invalidity theories set forth in the IPR petition. Whether the Board committed legal error by looking only to the \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d combination described in the prior art to find a motivation to combine.\n\nHoldings\n\nThe Board\u2019s finding that a person of ordinary skill would not have swapped the last two bits was not supported by substantial evidence. The Board committed legal error by going beyond the invalidity theories in the petition. The Board committed legal error by not considering alternative motivations to combine found in the prior art.\n\nBackground and Reasoning\n\n3G Licensing S.A. (3G) sued Honeywell Int\u2019l for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,319,718 (\u2019718 Patent). The \u2019718 Patent is directed to a method of coding a Channel Quality Indicator (\u201cCQI\u201d). Honeywell subsequently filed a petition for inter partes review (IPR), contending that claims 1, 2, 4, 5, and 15-23 of the \u2019718 Patent were obvious over the Philips reference alone, among other things.\n\nThe CQI indicates quality of a cellular connection received by a user\u2019s equipment, such as a user\u2019s mobile phone, and may be represented by a five-bit binary sequence. Rather than transmitting the five-bit sequence, user equipment instead encodes the message into a 16-bit or 20-bit \u201ccodeword\u201d containing enough information to enable the original message to be decoded. Prior to February 13, 2002\u2014the critical date of the \u2019718 Patent\u2014Philips determined that a twenty-bit encoder of the five-bit CQI sequence (20, 5) would improve accuracy of the CQI by appending the first and second most significant bits (MSB) to the end of the 16-bit codeword.\n\nLGE then proposed a 20-bit codeword that modified Philips by flipping the last two digits of the encoder table with the cited reason of \u201coptimizing system throughput.\u201d LGE incorporated this proposal into the \u2019718 Patent and later assigned its interest in the \u2019718 Patent to 3G.\n\nThe Board found that the IPR petition had not shown that a person of ordinary skill would have been motivated to switch the last two bits of the table of the Philips reference and further that, even if the petition had made this showing, it had not demonstrated the change would be desirable.\n\nIn reversing the Board\u2019s finding of non-obviousness, a majority of the three-judge panel explained how KSR did not support the Board\u2019s findings. Specifically, KSR states that \u201cthe problem motivating the patentee may be only one of many addressed by the patent\u2019s subject matter.\u201d Because the Board considered only the patentee\u2019s avowed purpose of \u201coptimizing system throughput,\u201d the Board incorrectly found that swapping the last two digits would not be obvious. Moreover, the majority found that the Board ignored Honeywell\u2019s unrebutted expert statement that swapping the last two digits \u201cwould have the purpose and effect of providing extra protection to the MSB\u201d and that \u201cproviding extra protection to the MSB would be a desirable goal.\u201d Accordingly, the Board\u2019s findings were unsupported by substantial evidence.\n\nThe majority next targeted the Board\u2019s legal conclusions, namely its conflation of anticipation and obviousness. The Board acknowledged that Philips recognized the benefit of giving extra protection to the MSB, yet found it significant that Philips did not propose swapping the final two digits, which would have the effect of protecting the MSB. Thus, the Board improperly gave weight to an anticipation theory which was not set out in the petition.\n\nFinally, the majority found legal error in the Board\u2019s failure to recognize that a claimed modification only need be desirable in light of the prior art, and not the \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cpreferred approach.\u201d The correct standard of obviousness is whether there is something in the prior art as a whole to suggest the desirability, and thus the obviousness, of the claimed invention. The Board failed to look at alternative motivations suggested in the Philips reference and thus committed legal error. In light of these findings, the majority reversed the Board\u2019s decision and held that the \u2019718 Patent was obvious in view of the Philips reference.\n\nDissent\n\nJudge Stoll dissented from the majority\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s decision, asserting that the majority had engaged in impermissible appellate factfinding. She argued that appellate courts should remand when a Board\u2019s conclusion is unsupported by substantial evidence, rather than reversing. Judge Stoll clarified that the teachings of a prior art reference are a question of fact, and thus reweighing unchallenged evidence about the teachings on appeal is an intrusion into the Board\u2019s fact-finding domain. However, Judge Stoll agreed with the majority that the Board had used improper legal standards. Therefore, in Judge Stoll\u2019s view, the court should instead have remanded to the Board to reevaluate obviousness using the proper standard.",

            "content": "A player rarely gets flowers for being objectively bad in the postseason, but Brent Honeywell Jr. was a rare exception for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2024.\n\nHoneywell, whom the Dodgers picked up off of waivers from the Pirates in July, might not have made any of the postseason rosters if it weren't for Alex Vesia being injured, but he had a nice second half out of the bullpen in LA, carrying a 2.62 ERA over 34 1/3 innings.\n\nThe Dodgers technically had four starters for the NLCS \u2014 Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Jack Flaherty, Walker Buehler, and Landon Knack \u2014 but it was pretty clear that they weren't going to entrust Knack, a rookie, with too many innings, and would instead turn to the bullpen for some long relief outings.\n\nHoneywell filled that role in his first two postseason appearances against the Mets, first with three innings in Game 2 and then 4 2/3 frames in Game 5. The first went off without a hitch; he allowed two hits and a walk, but no runs scored in an eventual 7-3 win for the Mets.\n\nIn Game 5, however, the Dodgers bullpen was running on fumes. Flaherty's second start lasted just three innings after he gave up eight runs. LA sent Honeywell out to take care of the majority of the game, and get knocked around in the process. Still, the Dodgers came back in Game 6 to take the series with a fully rested bullpen, and Honeywell said he didn't mind getting blown up. Instead, he wanted the Dodgers to \"save the dogs.\"\n\nThe Dodgers non-tendered Honeywell in November, but he hasn't let go of his stint with them yet. Fans are taking notice of multiple Instagram stories with the 2024 Dodgers and hoping he might be hinting at a reunion.\n\nIs Brent Honeywell Jr. hinting at a Dodgers return on Instagram?\n\nIt could be that Honeywell is just reminiscing on good times \u2014 after all, there aren't many players who get DFA'ed and then win a World Series in the same season \u2014 or making a not-so-subtle plea to the Dodgers to take him back but he certainly endeared himself to fans by taking one for the team in the LCS (and then again in Game 4 of the World Series, in a game the Dodgers sort of intentionally threw).\n\nThe bullpen is crowded as it is, and the Dodgers may still be on the lookout for a bonafide closer, but they could easily take Honeywell back on a minor-league deal and keep him in reserve in case of injury, just like last year.\n\nIf he doesn't end up back in LA, we'll always have \"save the dogs.\" It became a rallying cry for the Dodgers in those late postseason series, and it got Max Muncy to hand Honeywell the mic at the post-parade celebration. A huge ovation at Dodger Stadium isn't a bad note to go off on.",

As he has done in the past, Dr Oba Otudeko is always ready and available to assist any government agency with appropriate oversight in the execution of their duties, with the expectation that these affairs will be conducted with the highest standard of professionalism,\u201d the statement read.\n\nHe also called on journalists to verify sensitive information before publication to ensure accuracy and fairness.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect the role of the press in keeping the public informed, we urge journalists to verify such sensitive information before publication to ensure accuracy and fairness,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nOtudeko stated that at 81, he is now focused on mentoring future business leaders and fostering societal development through enterprise. He categorically ruled out any interest in serving in an executive or non-executive capacity in any organisation beyond his current commitments.\n\n\u201cHe is not interested in serving in an executive capacity in any organization in Nigeria or elsewhere, neither is he interested in serving in a non-executive capacity on any board asides those he currently sits on. This includes any possibility of returning to the board of FBN Holdings Plc, which appears to be the focus of the recent unfortunate news barrage,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe business mogul reaffirmed his trust in FBN Holdings, a 130-year-old legacy institution, to thrive in its future endeavours\n\nShare",

            "content": "Once you know that cyber-attacks are multiplying, what do you do next?\n\n\u201cMore security incidents remind everyone of the importance of cybersecurity, so there\u2019s clearly increasing awareness, guidelines and regulations about securing networks and physical infrastructures, protecting communications and energy sources, and keeping them updated,\u201d says Matthew Bohne, advisory board chair of International Society of Automation\u2019s (ISA) Global Cybersecurity Alliance and Chief Product Security Officer at Honeywell. \u201cLately, this means making device, networks and process applications secure by design and practice by following the ISA/IEC 62443 standard.\u201d\n\nGet your subscription to Control's tri-weekly newsletter.\n\nThough it\u2019s useful to adopt authentication, network segmentation, traffic evaluation and other common cybersecurity best practices, Bohne reports the extent to which users and organizations follow ISA/IEC 62443 or implement other defenses depends on their individual profiles and roles, and how far along they are with each.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s especially important for those in charge, such as chief engineers, to ask what\u2019s being done to secure their operations and facilities,\u201d explains Bohne. \u201cPlant Operators are typically focused on operations, but may not always have the resources or capability to focus on critical cybersecurity tasks such as applying software patches, securing budgets and looking at cyber risks that can impact the safe operation of their processes.\u201d\n\nSecurity at SOCAR and STAR\n\nFor instance, State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan Republic\u2019s (SOCAR) Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR) in Aliaga, Izmir province, can process 214,000 barrels of crude oil daily or about 10 million metric tons (Mt) annually. Though the refinery is only six years old, SOCAR\u2019s leadership was concerned about recent breaches in other energy sectors, and whether STAR had sufficient protections and skilled resources to apply and maintain them. They determined that STAR\u2019s cybersecurity support requirements included:\n\nPerformance monitoring from several different network levels;\n\nFlexibility for future extensions, so additional sites could be connected with minimal effort;\n\nSecurity clearance (SC) creation for Level 4 assets; and\n\nCentralized Microsoft and antivirus updates.\n\nTo align its industrial control system (ICS) and process control network (PCN) with global industry standards, STAR\u2019s managers consulted with Honeywell about countermeasures needed to elevate the refinery to the next level of cyber-assurance. Specifically, the refinery wanted on-premise, cloud-based, managed security services (MSS) that would provide visibility of operations technology (OT) assets and secure remote access. STAR subsequently implemented Honeywell\u2019s Forge MSS, which provides seamless protection across expanding ICS and PCN attack surfaces, and addresses the visibility, availability and reliability necessary for OT performance in process applications, networks, mobile environments and/or cloud-computing services.\n\nIn general, Forge MSS increases cyber-resilience, expedites risk mitigation, shortens recovery time and improves safety records by providing:\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Secure Connection featuring encrypted communication to protect data;\n\nAutomated patching and antimalware services to ensure all computers are updated with the\n\nlatest security protections;\n\nContinuous monitoring and alerting services to monitor the performance and health of the PCN; and\n\nIntelligent reporting services to transform system statistics into actionable trends.\n\nForge MSS let the refinery better manage and update its OT assets, as well as deploy an authenticated and encrypted virtual private network (VPN) that lets Honeywell\u2019s dedicated support engineers and subject matter specialists remotely troubleshoot security and maintenance issues. Honeywell\u2019s cybersecurity services let STAR:\n\nReduce the risk of security breaches;\n\nManage the security posture of its process control infrastructure;\n\nProvide 24/7 monitoring and alerting of the PCN, including controllers, servers and workstations; and\n\nDeliver intelligence reporting services to turn system statistics into actionable trends.\n\nSOCAR reports that Honeywell\u2019s assistance gave STAR better control over its OT environment, including improved visibility, connectivity, reporting and monitoring. Forge MSS also provided secure remote access and enterprise visibility of OT-related work without requiring onsite personnel. This saves time for the refinery\u2019s engineers and contractors, who can complete required assignments faster. In addition, geospatial technology and applications center (GTAC)-based remote access and support further reduces the need for onsite staff. Engineers working from home have become STAR\u2019s default practice, while sitework is reserved for emergencies and on-demand tasks.\n\nCommon-sense regulations\n\nTo meet demands for uniform cybersecurity practices, Bohne reports several governments developed and passed new cybersecurity regulations this year, most notably the European Union\u2019s (EU) Network and Information Security 2 (NIS 2) directive, EU\u2019s Radio Equipment Directive (RED) and its Cyber-Resilience Act (CRA).\n\nSimilarly, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14028, \u201cImproving the nation\u2019s cybersecurity,\u201d in May 2021, which requires U.S. federal agencies, contractors and service providers to enhance cybersecurity and software supply chain integrity. This was followed by the U.S. Dept. of Energy (DoE) that issued its \u201cCybersecurity Strategy\u201d in January. Bohne adds more rules are expected in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing greater sensitivity to cybersecurity worldwide, and customers asking for common specifications,\u201d adds Bohne. \u201cFrom a vendor\u2019s standpoint, users are getting the message, and seeking cyber-secure development practices that leverage ISA/IEC 62443 for making their products. This is a reminder that cyber-threats are everyone\u2019s problem and that cybersecurity is a team sport. Everyone in each organization must recognize their responsibility and participate for cybersecurity to be successful. For example, a supplier can make a cyber-secure product, but an owner or system integrator has to implement and enable these capabilities securely in order for it to be secure operationally.\n\nWhen users seek to update or replace components at the device-level to improve cybersecurity, Bohne reports his first question is: what\u2019s the age of the environment and what security is being applied now? \u201cEquipment that\u2019s 15-20 years old probably isn\u2019t easy to secure or support and may have already passed end-of-life, so it\u2019s no longer getting any software support. If it\u2019s isolated, it can likely continue to operate, but it will need alternative security controls because it\u2019s unlikely software updates are available,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever for owners to ensure they\u2019re keeping the security of their operations updated and patched. Industrial products developed in the last few years have even more cybersecurity designed and baked into devices, which can be tested to make certain they\u2019re secure. They also use a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) that ensures good development practices, with many vendors now getting their SDLC certified as compliant with key parts of ISA/IEC 62443.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"",

Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.\n\nThe 15 general industrial machinery stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 5.5% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 2.3% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON)\n\nOriginally founded in 1906 as a thermostat company, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a multinational conglomerate known for its aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions.\n\nHoneywell reported revenues of $9.73 billion, up 5.6% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.8%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but a miss of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates.\n\n\"Honeywell executed through a challenging environment in the third quarter, delivering segment margin1 and adjusted earnings per share1 above the high end of our guidance,\" said Vimal Kapur, chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell.\n\nHoneywell Total Revenue\n\nThe market was likely pricing in the results, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $218.71.\n\nRead our full report on Honeywell here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q3: Luxfer (NYSE:LXFR)\n\nWith its magnesium alloys used in the construction of the famous Spirit of St. Louis aircraft, Luxfer (NYSE:LXFR) offers specialized materials, components, and gas containment devices to various industries.\n\nLuxfer reported revenues of $99.4 million, up 2.1% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 15.9%. The business had an incredible quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nLuxfer Total Revenue\n\nLuxfer pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers.

After setting up in my basement bathroom, it performed impressively, only taking less than an hour reduce levels of humidity down to the 35%. I noticed that it also worked efficiently for mid-sized spaces, such as the living room, kitchen and laundry room.\n\nWhile it can handle 50 pints a day, the 14-pint water capacity does mean you'll be emptying that tank frequently. However, you can use the included hose to drain automatically and continuously. Once connected to its app, it's straightforward to operate and you can even set up multiple devices to run at the same time by using AI-enabled speakers.\n\nIn addition, I was impressed by its quiet operation and stylish, modern design makes an attractive feature in any room.

Once connected to its app, you can monitor it from your phone, including viewing the humidity levels and receiving alerts when the bucket is full. I can change the settings remotely too, adjusting the speed of the fan with three levels to choose from.\n\nVoice control is available via Alexa or Google Assistant, although two-factor authentication is missing. It stands out for storage though, as this dehumidifier can be \u2018nested\u2019 into itself, taking up half of the space.\n\nIn terms of performance, it gets the job done and proved to be a useful asset for us when dealing with a flooded basement. It\u2019s also incredibly easy to empty, thanks to the lower half turning into a bucket and handle.\n\nDespite the name, it can hold about 24 pints, although this is still relatively small compared to others on our list. Ultimately, this dehumidifier has a very user-friendly design which couldn't be more compact to store.\n\nAnd don't take just my word for it! Amazon reviews mentioned good performance and ease of setup. For instance, it's easy to connect to WiFi, runs well and does a good job. However, there are mixed opinions on ease of cleaning, noise, and appearance.\n\nRead our full Midea 20 pint cube dehumidifier review.\n\nBest for small spaces\n\nHomeLabs 22 Pint Dehumidifier (Image credit: Future)\n\n3. HomeLabs 22 Pint Dehumidifier Best for small spaces Our expert review: Specifications Capacity: 22 pints Drainage: Passive Energy Star certified: Yes Humidity sensor: Yes Frost sensor: Yes Auto restart: Yes Speeds: 3 Warranty: 1 year Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Quick and efficient in real-world tests + App is easy to use + Small stature Reasons to avoid - No carrying handle - Small tank that fills quickly\n\nThe HomeLabs 22 Pint Dehumidifier, which replaces the 30-pint model, has a 1,400 Sq Ft coverage. This makes it a great choice for small spaces including apartments, basements and other spaces. It's sleek and minimal, which is ideal to place in a room without taking up a lot of space.\n\nThis model did well in real-world tests for managing humidity levels in the bathroom, laundry room, and storage space with the doors open. It did particularly well in my basement bathroom, measuring approximately 100 square feet.\n\nWhen the temperature reached up to 79% humidity, it had taken about an hour for the levels to reach the target of 35%. The unit used about 235 watts while running, and used about .20 kWh. However, it seemed to struggle with handling humidity in larger spaces or exceeding 900 square feet, with a longer run time of four hours. In any case, my test results were far more accurate in smaller spaces, and it works well in less time.\n\nGenerally, the Homelabs 22 dehumidifier is easy to set up and use, with a quiet operation, around 55 decibels. Since it has a smaller tank, it does tend to fill up quickly if the room is very humid. Although, this also means that you\u2019ll need to empty it more frequently.\n\nRead the full HomeLabs 22 Pint Dehumidifier review.\n\nBest warranty\n\n(Image credit: Honeywell)\n\n4. Honeywell TP50AWKN Best warranty Specifications Capacity: 30 pints Drainage: Passive Energy Star certified: Yes Humidity sensor: Yes Frost sensor: Yes Auto restart: Yes Speeds: 2 Warranty: 5 years Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Visit Site Reasons to buy + Strong performance in real-world tests + Energy efficient + Longer warranty than most competitors Reasons to avoid - Small tank requires frequent emptying (if not using hose to continuously drain)\n\nThe Honeywell TP50AWKN, which replaces the virtually identical Honeywell TP50WK but adds Wi-Fi connectivity, is well regarded by professionals and customers alike.\n\nIf something does go wrong with the TP50AWKN, you're covered under Honeywell's five-year warranty. Most of the dehumidifiers we considered come with one-year or two-year warranties, so this extended policy ensures that your investment is protected.\n\nOne downside: The Honeywell TP50AWKN's water bucket holds just 7 pints (three-quarters of a gallon), a small fraction of what the machine can condense in a day. If you don't have the option to continuously drain, you'll find yourself emptying the water bucket more frequently with the Honeywell TP50AWKN or going without dehumidification once the tank reaches capacity.\n\nCustomers posted on Amazon liked the ease of use, and say it's easy to set up. However, opinions are mixed on durability, moisture sensor, performance, and noise.\n\nBest for basement\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIf you're dealing with a damp basement and not too fussed about the lack of an App, then the 50 Pint Frigidaire will get the job done well.\n\nDuring our tests, we put it to work in the most humid room in the house: the basement. With a size of around 1,000 square feet, the initial humidity level was around 50% to start. We were impressed that the Frigidaire dehumidifier got the humidity level to 35% in just 20 minutes. In fact, all of the humidity measurements on the unit matched up almost perfectly with our tester's Alexa air quality monitor.\n\nSimilarly, we ran tests in a humid, basement bathroom and the Frigidaire 50 Pint Dehumidifier was able to bring down humidity levels from 90% to 35% in just forty minutes. Which is surprisingly quick compared to others we tested.\n\nThe only downsides we noted are its size, hefty weight (it's 41 pounds), and noise levels. And if you're after handy smart features, this isn't for you. However, it is simple to operate, and it pulls a lot of moisture very quickly. Which, quite frankly, is all you really need to handle extremely damp basements or spaces.\n\nRead the full Frigidaire 50 Pint Dehumidifier review.\n\nBest for large spaces\n\nAmazon Basics Dehumidifier on floor (Image credit: Future)\n\n6. Amazon Basics 35 Pint Dehumidifier Best for mid-large spaces Our expert review: Specifications Capacity: 35 pints Drainage: Passive Energy Star certified: Yes Humidity sensor: Yes Frost sensor: Yes Auto restart: Yes Speeds: 3 Warranty: 1 year Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (White) View at Amazon (White) Reasons to buy + Strong performance in large, damp spaces + Energy efficient + Mounted on wheels for portability Reasons to avoid - A bit loud - Throws out a lot of heat\n\nThe Amazon Basics 35-Pint dehumidifier may have a basic spec, but I was impressed by its grand job in removing humidity levels fast. In tests, I was particularly impressed by its quality performance in mid-large sized rooms, with high levels of damp.\n\nI found that it worked quickly and efficiently to control humidity in spaces up to which measures about 900 square feet. However, it was overkill for any space under 600 feet or so, and threw out a lot of heat. With that being said, this model probably isn't best suited for smaller spaces.\n\nDespite having a 35-pint capacity, it is quite large and heavy to lift. Luckily, the unit is mounted on casters, which makes it easy to move around on the floor. Its six-liter bucket also slides out easily from the front of the unit and includes a handle to make it easy to empty.\n\nIt doesn't come with an App, but the buttons on the top of the unit allow you to power it on, make the adjustments you\u2019ll need and are straightforward to use.\n\nAnother downside is it was the noisiest of the all the models I'd tested, however, this wasn't a real deal-breaker. The most important factor was that it performed consistently well, and was able to remove humidity in large, damp spaces.\n\nRead the full Amazon Basics 35-Pint Dehumidifier review.\n\nAlso tested\n\nWe tested a wide selection of dehumidifiers at Tom's Guide, and despite doing a decent job, not all of them made it to our final cut. In case you still can't find a suitable one for your needs, you may want to check out these below.\n\nGE Energy Smart 35 Pint Dehumidifier: now $186 @ Amazon\n\nThis 35 pint dehumidifier works quickly in small spaces, and gives a decent performance. However, it lacks advanced features including App control, and was noisier than the other models we tested. A good buy if you simply want a basic spec to get the job done.

This included top-selling and highly reviewed machines on popular retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and The Home Depot.\n\nThe chosen selection of dehumidifiers were then subjected to hands-on, extensive testing in the same environment. Our reviewer spent weeks testing these dehumidifiers in damp environments like their basement, kitchen and other areas that were prone to high levels of humidity.\n\nTo evaluate how well the dehumidifier works for every situation and space, we looked at the following things:\n\nSet up and ease of use:\n\nWe looked at how easy it was to set up the dehumidifier in your space. How heavy is it move around? How many pints does it have? And does it have useful features such as wheels or a carry handle at the top for better portability? We even looked at the length of the power cable and whether it would be convenient for many households.\n\nAlso, we considered how easy it was to maintain the dehumidifier and to empty out the water bucket. And if the model had an included drain hose or built-in pumps, we looked at how efficient it was when draining moisture into sinks. In addition, how easy is it to clean afterwards and replace the filter.\n\nDesign and features:\n\nWe analyzed the overall design and whether its size was suitable for the space. We also looked at notable features such as LCD display , touch screen controls or remote control. We looked at whether it had settings like an auto-off feature, timer, frost control sensor, and auto-restart, and evaluated smart/app capabilities such as voice control. What's more, we noted if the app was easy to use and intuitive, and if there were any pairing issues.\n\nPerformance and efficiency:\n\nAs part of our testing, our reviewer ran the hot shower/faucet for about five minutes in the bathroom, kitchen and basement to get the room up to 90% humidity. Once the dehumidifier was turned on, it was left to run for under 12 hours each day over a few weeks.\n\nWe then timed how long it took for the dehumidifier to reduce humidity to the level set and total runtime for the day. For instance, the Honeywell 50 Pint dehumidifier (and our winner!) took less than an hour to reach 35% level - which was the fastest out of all the models. We also recorded the daily average and total runtime for over a week. For accurate readings, we matched the humidity of our space with Alexa\u2019s air quality monitor.\n\nIn addition, we monitored how many watts of power the dehumidifier used while it was running with the fan on high, and with the fan turned off. This helped us to determine total consumption and how energy-efficient the dehumidifier was. Other issues noted were discrepancies between the built-in humidistat readings and separate Alexa air quality monitor levels, any leakage issues, aswell as noise levels.\n\nHow to buy the best dehumidifier\n\nThere are a huge range of dehumidifiers on the market. Before choosing your favorite, here are a few factors you should consider:\n\nType\n\nThere are different types of dehumidifiers on the market. The most common type is a condensing dehumidifier, which pulls the absorbed air over refrigerated coils, which cools it enough the condense and separate the moisture.\n\nOther types include desiccant dehumidifiers, which will use a water-absorbing material, and thermoelectric dehumidifiers, which operate with charged plates. Generally speaking, neither of these latter two types are as effective as condenser models, which is why we only recommend this type in our list.\n\nCapacity\n\nDehumidifiers generally come in three sizes: large (45-50-pint capacity), medium (30-pint capacity) and small (20-22-pint capacity).\n\nUnder the old regulations, these sizes were 70, 50 and 30 pints, respectively, and you'll see such numbers with three older models above.\n\nNoise level\n\nIf you\u2019ll be placing a dehumidifier in a quiet room, such as a bedroom or home office, where you need to fall asleep or concentrate without being disturbed, consider the noise level of the dehumidifier before you buy. Aim for a dehumidifier with a decibel level of around 50 decibels or below, anything above this level will be louder.\n\nFeatures to look out for\n\nPint capacity \u2014 The capacity in pints relates to how much moisture the dehumidifier claims to absorb per day. The bigger the capacity, the larger and damper space it can handle.\n\nBucket size \u2014 Pint capacity shouldn\u2019t be confused with bucket size however. This specification indicates how much the internal bucket can actually hold before it will need to be emptied. The larger the bucket, the less often you will need to empty it.\n\nDrainage type \u2014 On this list you will find passive and pump drainage types. Passive types let you passively drain the water through a hose, or alternatively you can manually carry and empty the bucket yourself. Whereas pump drainage types will automatically pump the water out. Pumps are preferred as the water doesn\u2019t need to rely on gravity alone to drain, so you can direct the hose into a sink or out of the window. However, these models do cost more than without.\n\nEnergy Star Certification \u2014 It\u2019s always useful to look out for Energy Star Certification as this guarantees savings in terms of energy and money.\n\nHumidity sensor \u2014 With a humidity sensor, your dehumidifier will detect relevant changes in the atmosphere and can automatically switch on and, in some cases, set its power accordingly. Those without a sensor will just be manually controlled.\n\nFrost sensor \u2014 A frost sensor will detect the formation of ice on the condenser coils. The dehumidifier will then shut off the compressor to give the ice a chance to melt. If it continues to run with frost on the coils, this can damage the parts and make the appliance work much harder to absorb any moisture.\n\nAuto restart \u2014 If the dehumidifier suddenly loses power, auto restart means it will automatically switch back on to its previous settings once power is restored.\n\nNumber of speeds \u2014 This relates to how many speeds the fan has on the dehumidifier. The more speeds there are, the better as it gives you greater control and means excess energy isn\u2019t wasted.\n\nIf you're still unsure, check out these things you should know before buying a dehumidifier and 5 reasons your home needs a dehumidifier this summer. As long as your avoid these 7 common dehumidifier mistakes.\n\nWhere is the best place to put a dehumidifier?\n\nIdeally, a dehumidifier should be placed in the centre of a room to work efficiently. This allows the air to circulate properly around the unit.\n\nGenerally, a dehumidifier can dry out a room between 24 and 72 hours. But this depends on whether the room is large or has high humidity levels, which would take up to weeks to dry out.\n\nFor more top tips, check out our guide for where's the best place to put a dehumidifier.\n\nHow to clean a dehumidifier\n\nWhen you consider that bacteria and mold is being sucked into your humidifier, it\u2019s no wonder that it needs an occasional clean. Knowing how to clean a dehumidifier isn\u2019t as difficult as you might think, simply follow these steps if none are given in your manual:\n\n1. Unplug the humidifier from the wall. You don\u2019t want to risk an electric shock!\n\n2. Remove the water reservoir bucket and tip out any residual water. Clean this with warm soapy water and a microfiber cloth.\n\n3. While that\u2019s drying, wash the filters. The filters collect any impurities so it\u2019s essential that these get an occasional clean. You should have a main filter and potentially a much smaller bucket filter. If you\u2019re not sure where to find these you can refer to your manual. Both need to be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed and then left to dry.\n\n4. If you notice a lot of dust inside your machine, you can also use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to pick up any remaining fluff.\n\n5. Lastly, give the outside a once over with a microfiber cloth for finishing touches.",

For example, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur made $15.4 million in 2023 compared to a median wage of $80,363 that year for Honeywell\u2019s total employment of 118,500 workers, for a pay ratio of 192 to 1.\n\nA Securities and Exchange Commission regulation requires companies to report the ratio between its CEO and median worker compensation. Honeywell\u2019s information can be found on Page 97 of its 2024 proxy statement. Honeywell made headlines in 2018 in the first year of the requirement when it reported a CEO to median worker compensation gap of 333 to 1.

The state\u2019s $42 million economic grant is tied to Honeywell hitting targets for creating jobs, average wages and capital investment.\n\nOn those three fronts, Honeywell received all check marks on the annual report:\n\nJobs created: Target of 615 jobs, actually created \u2013 1,050\n\nAverage annual wages: Minimum of $278,560, actual wages \u2013 $315,328 (the targeted wage was $348,200, of which Honeywell is at 90.5%, and above the minimum average wage)\n\nCapital investment: $248.1 million, actual investment \u2013 $277.5 million\n\nOn Tuesday, the state\u2019s Economic Investment Committee approved a $3.4 million grant to Honeywell. This marked the fourth payment to Honeywell as part of the 12-year incentive package. Local incentives from Charlotte and Mecklenburg County bring the total incentive package to $88 million.\n\nCharlotte snagging the Fortune 200 company was a major coup. With the project, Honeywell relocated its senior management team along with its Safety and Productivity Solutions business group headquarters. Honeywell also established a hangar at Charlotte Douglas International Airport to house the company\u2019s headquarters aircraft and the associated flight and maintenance crew.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s technologies are used in a variety of industries from energy, safety, security, productivity and urbanization. It blends physical products with software to support connected solutions for buildings, factories, supply chains, utilities and aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe selected Charlotte because it offers a great business environment along with access to a workforce that has the skillset Honeywell will need to be competitive over the coming decades,\u201d former CEO Darius Adamczyk said at the time.

            "content": "On October 9, the USC Department of Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering partnered with Honeywell Aerospace Technologies to host a major industry event on campus focusing on hypersonics and related technologies. Hypersonics is the study of flight at speeds of Mach 5 or higher, which is five times the speed of sound.\n\nClose to 50 corporate representatives \u00adgathered at the USC Hotel to exchange ideas, learn about emerging areas of research and develop shared priorities across the astronautics, aerospace and defense industries.\n\nHoneywell sponsored the event, and selected USC Viterbi School of Engineering as the host site due to its strong reputation in aerospace research and education, along with its location in the Southern California aerospace ecosystem.\n\nWhen speaking about this honor, Dean Yannis Yortsos stated, \u201cUSC Viterbi is committed to cultivating strong ties with industry partners. As engineers working in the context of academia, our research directly feeds the development of new technologies that can be commercialized by corporations and governmental agencies, and our practically trained and socially conscious graduates are in high demand when it comes to recruiting the next generation of innovators in hypersonics and other aerospace disciplines.\u201d Jean Sage, Vice President of Engineering at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies, further supported the Dean\u2019s emphasis on industry partnership and opportunities for students.\n\nThe keynote speech was presented by retired Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, now a senior vice president of Anduril which specializes in autonomous systems for defense technology.\n\nThurgood clarified that defense is just one among many important applications of hypersonics. The strengthening of infrastructure for faster testing, exploring different propulsion methods beyond traditional rocket motors, and developing strategies for national defense against high-speed, high-impact hypersonic weapons are all key areas of focus for the future.\n\nA subsequent panel discussion on identifying the key challenges in the field comprised of lead hypersonics researchers from The Aerospace Corporation, Hermeus and Boeing, in addition to Thurgood. The challenges identified included the need for greater economic efficiency in hypersonic travel and ensuring that communication technologies can withstand the transition in and out of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThen came the introduction of the emerging solutions being developed at USC Viterbi. Associate Professor Ivan Bermejo-Moreno launched the faculty presentations by sharing his recent findings in a paper entitled \u201cNumerical simulation and modeling of flow physics in hypersonic flight and propulsion.\u201d This was balanced by the theoretical and material focus of the papers that followed presented by various members of the faculty.\n\nLeaps forward in propulsion technology will be the key to new breakthroughs in hypersonics, and the USC Rocket Propulsion Lab (USCRPL) presented their current projects in rocket development \u2013 most notably Aftershock II, which recently broke the world record as the first civilian-built rocket to reach an altitude of 470,000 feet, passing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line (the distinction between Earth\u2019s airspace and outer space) and reaching hypersonic speeds of up to Mach 6. You can watch a video about the launch here.\n\nStudent teams from across departments at USC Viterbi had the chance to present their research via poster presentations, which were viewed by industry recruiters on the lookout for fresh new ideas, including SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, Blue Origin, Ursa Major, Airborne Systems, and Lunar Outpost, in addition to the other companies noted above.\n\n\u201cLighting talks\u201d highlighted the focus areas of these industry leaders and demonstrated the strong presence of USC alumni across the top companies. For Professor Paul Ronney, chair of the USC Department of Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering (AME), the turnout was a testament to the department\u2019s focus on industry relations and students\u2019 future careers.\n\n\u201cSouthern California has been associated with the aerospace industry for over a century \u2013 this is one of the best places for a young engineer to develop experiential knowledge and ultimately to secure a top job,\u201d said Ronney. \u201cCommunication between industry and academia is vital for fostering that pipeline \u2013 we need to know what corporations need so that we can best prepare our students, and today\u2019s event is all about fostering that exchange.\u201d\n\nFor Ronney, one of the key differentiators of USC Viterbi\u2019s graduates is their fluency in converting ideas into tangible realities. He credits the USC Viterbi ethos of offering multiple opportunities for hands-on practice \u2013 whether joining USC Racing to design and build a racecar, testing new methods for flight with the USC AeroDesign Team or launching an industry-standard rocket developed by USCRPRL, to name just a few of the school\u2019s many student-run teams.\n\nSuitably enough, the day\u2019s panels and presentations concluded with an opportunity to witness that hands-on learning in practice. Tours of the USC AME Fabulous Fluids Facility, which houses the legendary Dryden Wind Tunnel and Blue Water Channel, and the Baum Family Maker Space provided behind-the-scenes glimpses into the experiments and prototypes being produced by faculty and students.\n\nFrom theory to practice, ideas to implementation, the day showed how new thinking and the meeting of new materials and computational strategies can come together to promote a culture of innovation.\n\n\u201cThis event marks a significant milestone for the school\u2019s leadership in aerospace research, including technologies that are key enablers for hypersonic flight and missions, and sets a precedent for the exchange between academia and industry in the years to come,\u201d said Dean Yannis Yortsos. \u201cCollaboration with other USC schools will further extend our capabilities. It\u2019s an exciting time for USC engineers.\u201d\n\nPublished on January 13th, 2025",

The company gained investors\u2019 attention on the local bourse ahead of its third quarter of the financial year 2025 earnings release. The market expects Honeywell to continue a drive to grow earnings, reversing negative profit performance.\n\nTrading data from the Nigerian Exchange showed that the food producer share price rose by 31.7% in a rally that spanned four out of five days to N10.02 from N7.61 at the beginning of the week.\n\nIts positive price movement was attributed to investors renewed interest in anticipation of strong profit performance. Trading at 52-week high on the Nigerian Exchange, the market value of Honeywell Flour Mills\u2019 7.930 billion shares outstanding surged to N79.46 billion.\n\nIts lowest price in 52 weeks was N3, suggesting a strong positive price movement, bolstered by Flour Mills of Nigeria\u2019s significant share acquisition in the company.

It transited from a net loss of N4.376 billion to N2.523 billion profit after tax in the period. Honeywell profit was spurred by a steep rise in revenue, up by 126% year on year from N79.44 billion to N179.594 billion in the space of one year.\n\nLikewise, its costs of sales skyrocketed by 140% year on year, faster than revenue growth. This had negative effects on gross margin at the time the company more than doubled down on selling and administration expenses, which settled at N5.463 billion from N2.536 billion.\n\nIts operating profit settled at N13.192 billion, up by about 25% year on year from N10.571 billion in the comparable period. Honeywell saved the day with a significant reduction in its finance costs, slashed from N6.54 billion to N2.151 billion in the first half of 2025 earnings period.\n\nAt the end of its first half results in September 2024, Honeywell posted 33.82 kobo earnings per share, a significant improvement when compared with 55.18 loss per share. #Honeywell Plc Hits 52-week High ahead of Q3 Earnings CBN Opens FX Window for BDC to Stock up at NFEM Rate",

Each machine contains a fan that draws the warm outside air into the appliance and then passes it over water-soaked pads inside the unit to cool the air.\n\nWhy buy an evaporative cooler?\n\nMany Aussies rely on air conditioning however, this can get quite expensive. But an evaporative cooler is a great energy-efficient alternative and is usually much cheaper to buy, install and run. Easily manoeuvrable, these devices are the perfect option for people looking to cool different spaces and rooms at different times.",

This 21 per cent increase represents a strong recovery from its recent low of N170.\n\nThis resurgence is largely attributed to successful fundraising activities in the debt market, which have helped the company address its working capital needs.\n\nHowever, MTN Nigeria continues to grapple with challenges, including foreign exchange losses and other financial pressures.\n\nAnalysts warn that the stock\u2019s recovery could face headwinds, with its trajectory depending on positive outcomes in telecom tower lease renegotiations and efforts to localize its debt obligations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the close of the trading week, MTN Nigeria\u2019s market capitalization stood at N5.08trn, a significant jump from N4.199trn recorded at the beginning of the week. This translates to a market value gain of N881.81trn.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria led in terms of market value, other companies also recorded notable gains during the week. Multiverse Mining and Exploration Plc emerged as the top gainer, achieving a 53.42 per cent increase in its share price, which climbed from N8.05 to N12.35.\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills Plc also performed impressively, with its shares appreciating by 31.67 per cent to close at N10.02 per share, up from N7.61. Similarly, Daar Communications Plc experienced significant growth, as its share price rose by 25.71 per cent, moving from 70 kobo to 88 kobo.\n\nThe overall performance of the Nigerian Exchange was positive, with the NGX All-Share Index rising by 1.80 per cent to settle at 105,451.06 points. Market capitalization also increased to N64.303trn, reflecting a boost in investor confidence.\n\nDuring the week, investors traded 4.698bn shares worth N85.043bn in 72,562 deals. This was a significant improvement compared to the previous week\u2019s turnover of 2.618bn shares valued at N69.742bn across 47,953 deals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most indices closed higher, a few sectors experienced declines. The NGX Insurance Index recorded the steepest drop, falling by 6.91 per cent.\n\nThe NGX AFR Bank Value Index and NGX AFR Div Yield Index also declined, shedding 0.08 per cent and 1.11 per cent, respectively. Additionally, the NGX Consumer Goods, Oil and Gas, and Industrial Goods indices each saw minor decreases of 0.34 per cent. Meanwhile, the NGX ASeM Index remained unchanged throughout the week.\n\nMarket analysts attribute the positive trajectory to increased demand pressure for stocks listed on the NGX, marking a rebound from a bearish trend in preceding weeks.\n\nMTN Nigeria\u2019s strong performance highlights its resilience despite prevailing economic challenges. As the company continues to implement strategic measures to address financial pressures, it remains well-positioned to maintain its leadership on the NGX. The broader market\u2019s improved turnover and investor sentiment suggest a favorable outlook for the coming weeks.",

Garuda Indonesia (Persero).\n\nThe products will be standard on 25 B737-800 aircraft delivered between mid 2009 and 2011. The contract, valued at more than $28 million, includes an option for 25 additional aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe selection of IntuVue is a testament to PT. Garuda Indonesia\u2019s emphasis on safety,\u201d said Mike Madsen, Vice President, Airlines, Honeywell Aerospace. \u201cHoneywell\u2019s IntuVue weather radar is leading the industry in turbulence and wind shear detection, a key component of safety related incidents. It is important we solve our airline partner needs with equipment that helps them increase safety and reduce operating costs.\u201d\n\nThe total avionics package includes Honeywell\u2019s IntuVue; partial Quantum\u2122 line of communication and navigation sensors comprising Multi Mode Receiver (MMR), Radio Altimeter and Automatic Direction Finder (ADF); the CAS 100 aircraft collision avoidance system, solid-state data recorders and voice recorders, Flight Data Acquisition and Management System (FDAMS), airborne data loader, the cockpit data printer and the Automatic Fixed Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).\n\nIntuVue is the first fully automatic weather radar system certified to the FAA\u2019s Enhanced Turbulence Detection Minimum Operation Performance Standard (MOPS), improving pilots\u2019 ability to see and avoid weather, wind shears and turbulence sooner. Specific turbulence-related injuries cost the airline industry more than $100 million a year.\n\nIntuVue is the only commercial radar that displays storms in three-dimensions at up to 320 nautical miles ahead of the aircraft and key analysis tools which allow pilots to dissect and analyze weather and hazards both vertically and horizontally. These features have demonstrated a significant improvement for in-flight weather-related decisions, and more than a 45 percent improvement in turbulence detection, enabling pilots\u2019 to optimally reroute around or through weather for passenger safety and comfort while decreasing fuel burn. Besides enhanced safety, IntuVue offers improved reliability and reduces system weight to lower operating costs for operators. IntuVue increases system reliability by 50 percent, reduces maintenance costs by 30 percent, and reduces weight by 25 percent as compared to other radars \u2014 yielding airlines a $10,000/year savings over existing systems.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s IntuVue is certified and flying on the Boeing 777 and 737NG as buyer furnished equipment and is standard equipment on the Airbus A380. It will become available on the A320 family in 2010 and the A330 family in 2011. It is specified as standard equipment on the Gulfstream 650 and Airbus A350 when they enter service.\n\nThe Flight Data Acquisition & Management System (FDAMS) is a multi-function airborne Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) that collects and sends mandatory aircraft data to the flight recorder.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Quantum line of navigation radios, sensors, receivers and communication equipment is derived from more than 75 years of communication and navigation system development experience.\n\nWith more than 40 years of Traffic/Aircraft Collision Avoidance System (TCAS/ACAS) development experience, Honeywell has been a pioneer in providing advanced collision avoidance protection and airspace situational awareness technologies.\n\nHoneywell\u2019s Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) are simple to operate and provide advanced transmission reliability. They offer global satellite coverage and automatic activation.\n\nTogether, this suite of avionics equipment increases safety while reducing pilot workload, operating costs and maintenance costs for the airlines.\n\nBased in Phoenix, Arizona, Honeywell\u2019s aerospace business is a leading global provider of integrated avionics, engines, systems and service solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, business and general aviation, military, space and airport operations.",

With the right approach, you could cut your energy bills by hundreds each year without sacrificing warmth.\n\nFortunately, optimizing your thermostat settings doesn't require any special skills. Whether you heat your home with a traditional furnace or a high-tech HVAC system, small tweaks can make a big difference.\n\nBy dialing in the ideal temperature and making a few smart energy adjustments, you can keep your home cozy while keeping costs low. Staying warm doesn't have to come at a high price -- just a little strategy can help you save big.\n\nCan solar panels save you money? Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\n\n\"It's more than just a number on the wall,\" said Julian Picard, owner of HVAC company Centerline Mechanical, referring to the importance of knowing your thermostat.\n\nHere's what you need to know to stay comfortable in winter months while saving some serious cash on your heating bill.\n\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the winter\n\nIn the winter, experts recommend that you set your thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit when you're home, and 60 to 65 degrees when you're asleep or away.\n\nYou can set it higher, but that will reduce efficiency and lead to higher energy bills. It also depends on what the weather is like outside, Picard said. If it's 20 F outside, maybe don't set your thermostat to 80 F, he advised.\n\nThen there's the question of changing the temperature at night or when you're not home. The Department of Energy suggests you turn your thermostat back 7 to 10 degrees from its normal setting for 8 hours a day, saying that can save as much as 10% a year on heating and cooling.\n\nPicard suggested a smaller change: Lower the temperature by just four degrees when you're away or asleep. This means your system won't have to work quite as hard to get back to temperature..\n\n\"You don't want to have drastic changes in temperature,\" said Mahlie Dukes, franchise owner of WIN Home Inspection in Indiana.\n\nYou should also get to know your specific heating system. If you notice, for example, that your home never gets up to the temperature you set, that could be a sign that your system is improperly sized for your home, Picard says. And it's a cue to lower your thermostat setting so your HVAC won't constantly be working on overdrive.\n\nRead more: You Can Actually Save Money by Using Electricity at These Specific Times\n\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the summer\n\nIn the summer, the ideal temperature for your thermostat is 75 to 78 F when you're home, and 80 degrees when you're away or asleep, Dukes said. The DOE suggests 78 F during the day, 82 F when you're sleeping and 85 F when you're not home.\n\nMost importantly, you want to make sure your system can handle it. If you notice that the house never gets as cool as your thermostat setting, that probably means your system is not sized well for your home, and you might want to ease up on the cooling. You may also want to check on how well sealed your doors and windows are and how well insulated your home is.\n\nAir conditioners can only really cool your home to 15 to 20 degrees below the outdoor temperature, so setting the thermostat too low can result in your system running without being effective.\n\nWatch this: Easy Ways to Lower Your Utility Bills and Save Money 08:13\n\nDoes it matter what type of HVAC you have?\n\nYes and no. The same general temperature recommendations apply regardless of the type of HVAC you have in your home, Picard says.\n\nBut your results may vary depending on the type and size of your system. Systems that are over- or under-sized for your home will run inefficiently, which leads to higher heating and cooling costs.\n\nThis is why Picard recommends that you have an HVAC professional inspect and clean your system annually. These pros can tell you how best to use your specific system for the best comfort and efficiency, he said.\n\nAvoid this common thermostat mistake\n\nSay your home is quite a bit colder than you'd prefer, and you want it to be perfect now. It may be 65 F inside and you may want it to be 70 F. Don't set it to 75 in the hopes that it will warm it up faster. Most HVAC units have two settings -- on or off -- and there's no getting to 70 F any more quickly.\n\nSet your thermostat to the temperature you want it to be. Setting to a warmer or cooler temperature than you actually desire in the hopes that will speed things along will just result in overcooling or overheating -- and overspending on your energy bills.\n\nIs your thermostat in the wrong place?\n\nYour thermostat knows how to set the temperature because it has a thermometer in it. So if your thermostat is in the wrong spot, it won't give you an accurate reading of the temp in your home.\n\nYou want to avoid having your thermostat in a location that sees frequent changes in temperature or humidity, like in the kitchen or the bathroom. If it's on an exterior wall, it might be more sensitive to outdoor temperature changes.\n\nInstead, try to position your thermostat on an interior wall in a location like your living room.\n\nAnd if you have a thermostat that supports external room sensors, having sensors in other locations, like a bedroom, can help you better regulate the temperature in the rooms where you spend most of your time.\n\nSave money by setting your thermostat\n\nReducing your energy bills this year doesn't have to be hard.\n\n\"There's a huge misconception that in order to be energy efficient you must be uncomfortable,\" Picard said.\n\nHomeowners can also look at areas beyond their thermostat. Investing in good insulation, for example, can greatly reduce how much strain you put on your HVAC system.\n\n\"You'd be surprised how much energy we blow right through our attics,\" Picard said.\n\nThat annual inspection and maintenance appointment can also help save you money. Picard said buildup within your HVAC system can lead to efficiency losses of up to 10% annually, which you'll see on your energy bill. That's why having it cleaned every year is a good move.\n\nAnd if you're in the market for a new HVAC system, it's a great time to take stock and make sure what you have fits your specific home.",

            "content": "The United States Department of Defense has been criticized by Chinese commentators for pushing unilateralism after it added Tencent Holdings and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) to its \u201cChinese military companies\u201d list.\n\nThe department on January 7 released an update of the Section 1260H list of Chinese military companies operating directly or indirectly in the US. The updated CMC list now includes 134 Chinese companies.\n\nFrom HK$408.6 on January 6, shares of Tencent, the largest Hong Kong-listed company by market cap, have declined 9.5% to HK$369.6 as of January 10. Shares of the Shenzhen-listed CATL have dropped 4.2% to 246 yuan (US$33.5) during the period.\n\nApart from Tencent and CATL, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Limited (Comac), which produces China\u2019s self-developed C919 airliners, was added to the CMC List for the second time. The company had been on the list in January 2021 but was then removed in June of the same year after winning an appeal.\n\nMajor suppliers to Comac\u2019s C919 aircraft include the United States\u2019 GE Aviation, Collins Aerospace and Honeywell Aerospace and France\u2019s Safran Aircraft Engines.\n\nA dozen subsidiaries of the previously-blacklisted Aviation Industry Corporation of China Ltd (AVIC), China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Limited (CASIC) and China Communications Construction Group (CCCG) were added to the CMC List.\n\nThe Hefei-based ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc (CXMT), which produces DRAM for use in computer servers and smart vehicles, is also on the blacklist now.\n\nLast March, media reports said CXMT would be blacklisted because it planned to make high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which can be used as artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators.\n\nThe defense department said updating the Section 1260H list is an important continuing effort in highlighting and countering the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion\u201d strategy, which aims to help the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) acquire advanced technologies and expertise from local companies, universities and research programs.\n\nIt said the US government reserves the right to take further actions on these entities under authorities other than Section 1260H.\n\n\u201cChina stands firmly against the United States\u2019 practice of overstretching the concept of national security, making discriminatory lists in various names and going after Chinese companies to contain China\u2019s high-quality development,\u201d Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said in a media briefing on January 7.\n\nHe said the US should immediately correct its wrongdoings, and end the illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese companies. He said China will take all measures necessary to firmly defend the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and uphold its legitimate right to development.\n\n\u2018Unfair competition\u2019\n\n\u201cSome of the 134 companies on the Chinese Military Companies list are defense contractors, but many others are unrelated to the defense industry sector,\u201d Zhou Xinping, a columnist for the Beijing Review, writes in an article published on January 9. \u201cThey are blacklisted as they are technology firms. It\u2019s not difficult to understand why Tencent is added to the list this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of suppression has nothing to do with national security, but with unfair competition,\u201d Zhou says. \u201cIt is unethical behavior carried out by the US government against Chinese technology companies to maintain the advantages of US firms.\u201d\n\nZhou says the inclusion of Tencent on the CMC List illustrates the United States\u2019 growing unilateralism. He says it has become increasingly urgent for the international community to join together to safeguard the global trade rules and order.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 inclusion of Chinese companies on various lists has become a means of suppressing China\u2019s scientific and technological development,\u201d says Huang Haifeng, a Shaanxi-based columnist. \u201dThese moves may cause trouble to some outstanding companies in the short term, but they will help boost the innovation capabilities and international competitiveness of Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nHuang points out that some companies, such as Xiaomi Corp and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, had won their appeals in the past and been removed from the list. He says blacklisted firms should not be afraid of US sanctions as they can still grow their businesses by partnering with companies outside the US.\n\nTencent\u2019s Chairman Ma Huateng said in a stock exchange filing on January 7 that the inclusion of Tencent in the CMC List is a mistake as the company is \u201cneither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base.\u201d\n\n\u201cTencent intends to initiate a reconsideration process to correct this mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the process, it will engage in discussions with the DOD to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the company from the CMC List.\u201d\n\nMa stressed that the Chinese Military Companies list is different from the Non-Specially Designated Nationals Chinese Military-Industrial Complex (NS-CMIC) list maintained by the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), so an inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons from business dealings with Tencent.\n\nQui Mengyun, a partner at AllBright Law Offices, a Shanghai-based law firm, said although companies on the CMC List are not subject to financial sanctions and US export controls, they will face obstacles when bidding for some US government contracts.\n\nShe said there is a certain degree of overlap between the NS-CMIC List and the CMC List.\n\nIn the past, many companies on the CMC List were also sanctioned by the US Treasury and Commerce Department.\n\nThose sanctioned by the US Treasury, such as Huawei Technologies, find it difficult to export their products to countries that settle trade in US dollars.\n\nThose sanctioned by the Commerce Department, such as Dawning Information Industry Co (Sugon) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), cannot obtain high-end machineries and parts from the United States. They either have to spin off their units or source US parts and materials via third parties or countries.\n\nYong Jian is a contributor to the Asia Times.

The claimed method was developed as part of 3GPP\u2019s efforts to establish 3G wireless standards. Back in January of 2002, Philips had submitted a proposal to the 3GPP working group for a basis sequence table for encoding CQI (shown below on the left). In February of 2002, LG Electronics (LGE) filed a Korean patent application, to which the \u2019718 patent claims priority, with the basis sequence table shown below on the right. Apart from the last two bits in the last row, which are flipped, the two basis sequence tables are identical. Two days after filing the Korean application, LGE proposed the basis sequence table in the \u2019718 patent to the 3GPP working group with the rationale that this modified table \u201cfocus[es] on optimizing system throughput.\u201d In July of 2002, the 3GPP working group adopted LGE\u2019s proposal.\n\n3G Licensing acquired the \u2019718 patent from LGE in 2020 and proceeded to file a dozen lawsuits against various defendants. Several of those defendants petitioned for inter partes review of the \u2019718 patent based on the January 2002 Philips reference, arguing that a POSA would have been motivated to flip the last two bits of the basis sequence table to reduce error and provide additional protection to the most significant bits (MSB) of CQI. The PTAB rejected this motivation-to-modify argument and issued a final written determination of non-obviousness.\n\nThe Federal Circuit reversed, stating that the PTAB\u2019s conclusion of non-obviousness was improperly based on its finding that the \u2019718 patent\u2019s primary motivation was to \u201cfocus on system throughput\u201d rather than minimizing errors and providing extra protection of MSB. The Federal Circuit determined that requiring a POSA\u2019s motivation to modify prior art to be the same as the inventor\u2019s motivation contradicts KSR\u2019s express directive: \u201cThe fact that the inventor of the [challenged] patent may have had a different or even novel motivation that led them to [modify the prior art] reference is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit further held that the PTAB\u2019s reliance on the uncertainty of the \u201cpreferred\u201d approach for coding CQI to evaluate motivation was erroneous because obviousness \u201cdoes not require that a particular [modification] must be the preferred, or the most desirable, [modification] described in the prior art in order to provide motivation for the current invention.\u201d Noting the uncontroverted testimony of the petitioner\u2019s expert that a POSA would have been motivated to swap the last two digits of the table in Philips to reduce errors and maximize protection of MSB, the Federal Circuit reversed the FWD as unsupported by substantial evidence.",

            "content": "Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter\n\nThe Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium kept my 1,500-square-foot, three-level house more consistently comfortable than any other thermostat we tested, likely because the Ecobee Premium is able to use indoor humidity data when automatically adjusting the temperature set point (more on that below). It comes with a terrific remote sensor that detects temperature, to help balance comfort throughout your home, as well as presence, so you can have your HVAC ensure that the room you\u2019re occupying is at your preferred temperature. The thermostat also has a mic and a built-in smart speaker, which enables voice control. The Ecobee Premium uses AI to figure out when to heat and cool, and it has stylish glass and metal hardware. Ecobee also has a best-in-class privacy policy, and notably, the company still provides tech support for even its earliest models.\n\nInstallation was reasonably straightforward but not perfect. A phone app walked me through the process step-by-step. Our setup was simplified because it already had a \u201cC\u201d wire, or common wire, which is a constant power source required by most modern thermostats. The Ecobee Premium includes a C-wire adapter for those systems that don\u2019t have a C wire already. If you are uncomfortable fiddling with tools and wires, it might be smart to hire a qualified installer\u2014you can find one on the Ecobee website.\n\nThe Ecobee is powerful, but maximizing its capabilities can be complex, and it requires using a web browser to access advanced settings. Ecobee\n\nEcobee learns your schedule and your home. As with the Google Nest Learning Thermostat, the idea with the Ecobee Premium is that you set your preferred temperature manually, then Ecobee\u2019s Schedule Assistant learns your behavior over time. If it sees that you could save more energy, it will suggest a better Schedule for you, but those changes don\u2019t happen automatically\u2014you have to make them yourself. Ecobee\u2019s webpage gives you insights and real-time updates about your energy usage and thermostat set points (which Nest doesn\u2019t offer).\n\nSimilarly, Ecobee also learns over time how long it takes to heat or cool your house, a process it calls Smart Recovery. It then uses that info to adjust when it kicks on so that your house is at your preferred temperature right at your preferred time.\n\nThe Eco+ setting may be the most valuable feature. Yet, an Ecobee representative says it\u2019s the most underused, too. When you enable Eco+ mode, the thermostat considers a room\u2019s humidity when automatically adjusting the temperature setting to secure greater efficiency and savings (note that the Nest also uses indoor humidity to calculate the best temperature setting). Here\u2019s a little trick of human physiology: The higher the humidity in a room, the warmer the air feels. The Ecobee calculates how the temperature feels (similar to how weather websites tell you what the outdoor temperature \u201cfeels like\u201d). Then, it takes advantage of that phenomenon whenever possible by heating just a little less in winter and cooling a little less in summer. The result is that the Ecobee is able to eke out maximum energy savings without any sacrifice in comfort.\n\nThe Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium comes with a single SmartSensor, a tiny device you place in a room that is too warm or cold. The Ecobee can be told to either average or bias the temperature overall to balance out that room. Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter\n\nThe room sensors are excellent. One remote temperature and presence SmartSensor is included with the Premium. You\u2019re meant to place it in another part of your house to help even out heating and cooling across your home. Additional sensors can be bought separately, depending on your needs.\n\nThese 1.75-inch, squarish sensors can not only help even out temps throughout a house but also detect when there is a person present and, if you like, prioritize the comfort settings in that room. So if you are in a room that runs hotter than the rest of the house, Ecobee will let the temperature drop throughout that heating zone until the warmer room you\u2019re in is at your desired temperature. (The same process works with cooling, as well.) The unobtrusive sensors come with little magnetic stands for setting them on a shelf, table, or bookcase, but there are a variety of mounting options.\n\nEcobee Premium is like an Amazon Echo Dot on your wall. The Premium is the only current smart thermostat with a built-in smart speaker, and the audio quality and microphone responsiveness are on a par with those of the third-generation Amazon Echo Dot. All of the standard Echo speaker features are here, including Alexa Calling, Messaging, and Drop In, so you can use your thermostat as you would an old-school intercom system. Notably, while you can listen to Spotify directly through it, you can\u2019t use it as a part of an Alexa multiroom music setup.\n\nYou can also enable the speaker to work with Siri to accept voice commands directly and to act as an AirPlay speaker, including as part of a multiroom audio system. We haven\u2019t tested that feature yet, but we will update this review when we do (Ecobee explains the setup process here).\n\nIf you aren\u2019t interested in having a smart assistant like Alexa (or Siri) in your home, you can completely disable it in the settings of the Ecobee app.\n\nThe Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium is made from higher-end materials like metal instead of plastic, and it has a built-in Alexa smart speaker capable of accepting voice commands. Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter\n\nThe Ecobee Premium is all metal and glass. This adds a level of polish that is important to some device owners (even if it makes no difference in performance). The display shows the temperature, the weather outside, the time, and indoor air-quality scores. When indoor air quality drops, the Ecobee sends an alert telling you to open a window or turn on an air purifier. Ecobee was purchased in 2021 by Generac, an auxiliary generator company, and the thermostat can now display the operating status of the company\u2019s generators, although it can\u2019t control them.\n\nDon\u2019t need built-in Alexa or an included remote sensor? You might consider the more basic Ecobee Smart Thermostat Enhanced, which doesn\u2019t include the speaker and mic, remote sensor, or air-quality monitor. It also has more modest plastic housing. Beyond those differences, it runs an HVAC system just as well as the Premium model.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe Ecobee Premium\u2019s installation is like that of most thermostats, though we did experience connection issues at first. There are also some obscure technical questions during setup that may require research (\u201cHow is your reversing valve energized?\u201d).\n\nWe experienced voice-command issues both with Siri and when using the built-in Alexa. (This may be a problem specific to me\u2014no voice recognition of any kind has ever worked well for me.)\n\nIf Alexa is enabled, by default you will receive spoken notifications and reminders about Amazon purchases, and many may find this intrusive. One time, Alexa gave a spoken reminder through the thermostat\u2019s speaker to rate a recent purchase. I turned that setting off in the privacy section of the Alexa App.\n\nCustomer support is lacking. A Wirecutter editor was troubleshooting an Ecobee that wouldn\u2019t connect to the internet, and they waited 30 minutes on hold before giving up and leaving a number for a callback, which came hours later. The technician was unable to solve the issue and said they would investigate and call back, but they never did. A week later, a summary email arrived, closing the case with no solution. (The thermostat fixed itself in the end.)\n\nHow the Ecobee Premium has held up\n\nThe author of this guide, Roy Furchgott, has rotated the Ecobee Premium in with other test thermostats since we first made it a pick. And after an initial hiccup, he remains very pleased. \u201cThe Ecobee initially changed temperatures too drastically in an attempt to save energy, which backfired, causing my heat-pump-based system to run almost nonstop. After manually fine-tuning it to correct this issue, and nearly a year and a half of testing since then, it has chugged along without incident. On top of being trouble-free, its looks have drawn admiring comments from visitors.\u201d\n\nPrivacy snapshot\n\nEcobee collects information pertinent to the functioning of the thermostat. During installation, it asks for your name, email, home address, home age, the number of floors in your home, and the number of occupants.\n\nGeofencing technology requires tracking your phone location. You can opt out in the Ecobee app\u2019s settings.\n\nEcobee does not share customer data with third parties.\n\nYou can read the full privacy policy here.",

His concept, broadly referred to as \"find me, help me,\" involved using the security system to monitor and assist individuals during emergencies. He envisioned a system that could track those individuals in a building who would need emergency assistance, so those individuals could be located and assisted with the proper equipment in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\nFrom Idea to Reality\n\nIn 2024, Ryan's idea was brought to life through persistence, innovation and collaboration.\n\nIn partnership with Anni Lano, Honeywell\u2019s Accessibility Program Director and a leader in Honeywell\u2019s All Abilities Employee Network, Ryan shared his new product idea with leadership.\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s \u2018find me, help me\u2019 idea is a perfect example of how diversity and inclusion leads to more creative solutions for all our customers and the societies we serve,\u201d Lano said. \u201cThis solution enables first responders to more quickly support building occupants in the event of an emergency. Not only does this help people with permanent disabilities, but those with situational disabilities, like low vision due to smoke, as an example.\u201d\n\nBen Wolf, a product leader at Honeywell with multiple patents in self-test, AI-based technology and innovations supporting people with disabilities, worked with Ryan to bring the fire and life safety enhancement concept to fruition.\n\nHe conducted interviews with Ryan and other colleagues with disabilities through the All Abilities Employee Network to understand their needs and concerns, ensuring that the system would truly address their specific challenges.\n\n\"My job is to be a good listener,\" Wolf said. \"It's about really trying to extract what people think and feel from their positions and what they do and what their anxieties and fears are in an emergency situation.\"\n\nInclusive Life Safety: How it Works\n\nWolf enhanced Ryan\u2019s original concept by applying new fire detection technology \u2013 specifically, fire detectors with Bluetooth capabilities. These beacons are designed to be strategically installed throughout buildings, emitting signals detectable by other Bluetooth-enabled devices. This setup allows for precise tracking of individuals within the building, helping to ensure that in the event of an emergency, first responders can quickly locate and assist those with disabilities.",

At the same time, with room temperature being a major factor in perceptions of \u201ccomfort,\u201d home improvement specialists walk that fine line of frugal yet comfortable.\n\nIn the past, smart thermostats have acted as passive savers, but more recently, manufacturers have begun to make smart thermostats take a more active role in regulating energy consumption.\n\nFor example, the First Alert app enables an automatic away mode that detects when all users have left the house and delivers optimized energy savings until they return. Users can also enroll in energy management programs offered through their local utilities to greatly boost the functionality of the X2S.\n\nOther manufacturers like ecobee\u2013who just launched their own smart thermostat in roughly the same price range\u2013have also begun incorporating energy monitoring/management capabilities into their devices. A recent update has even made it so that the device will lower HVAC usage during periods of grid instability to prevent outages.\n\nCE Pros Still Hold an Active Role in Device Efficacy\n\nHoneywell touts that on average, Honeywell Home thermostat users save on average 22% for heating and 17% on cooling for HVAC energy consumption. Of course, this is when using the recommended scheduling feature consistently, which, as most professionals will say, comes down to whether the homeowner is constantly tinkering with the settings.\n\nThat still leaves room for proactive education on the part of any professional installing the device. At the very least, it necessitates some handy management of expectations for the homeowner, because despite this being largely pitched as a DIY solution, Resideo acknowledges that roughly half of consumers prefer a professional to install their thermostat to be able to get the most out of the device.",

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Honeywell International ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nHoneywell International's Improving Profits\n\nEven modest earnings per share growth (EPS) can create meaningful value, when it is sustained reliably from year to year. So EPS growth can certainly encourage an investor to take note of a stock. Honeywell International has grown its trailing twelve month EPS from US$8.12 to US$8.74, in the last year. That's a modest gain of 7.6%.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Honeywell International maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.0% to US$38b. That's progress.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Honeywell International's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can .\n\nAre Honeywell International Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$147b company like Honeywell International. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$127m. This comes in at 0.09% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nDoes Honeywell International Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Honeywell International is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find that you need to be mindful of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

Jan. 2, 2025)\n\nIn this week\u2019s Case of the Week, the Federal Circuit reversed an inter partes review finding of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which had upheld the patentability of challenged claims of appellee 3G Licensing\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 7,319,718. The \u2019718 patent claimed transmission encoding methods essential to the 3G and 4G cellular communications standards, and was weighed against prior art that comprised 3G consortium members\u2019 consideration of desirable standards shortly before the patent\u2019s critical date. A majority of the reviewing panel found the challenged claims reflected no more than routine experimentation and optimization of a proposal that had been circulated prior to the patent\u2019s filing, and were therefore unpatentable as obvious.\n\nBroadly speaking, the \u2019718 patent claimed a method of reducing errors in the transmission of channel quality information (CQI), a metric that had been used in cellular communications services to inform the allocation of bandwidth. The \u2019718 patent\u2019s claims were directed to encoding the five-bit CQI into a 20-bit \u201ccodeword,\u201d using conversion methods that redundantly repeated certain bits of the CQI to compensate for transmission errors. By the time 3G consortium member LG Electronics filed the application leading to the \u2019718 patent, it and other members had been considering 20-bit codeword solutions for several months, and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Philips) had recently proposed a method that differed from the claimed method only by the transposition of two bits in a conversion table. The patent was later transferred to the 3G Licensing entity, which sued appellant Honeywell after Honeywell refused to take a license. Honeywell then filed the IPRs underlying this appeal.\n\nIn upholding the challenged claims as patentable, the Board relied largely on the \u2019718 patent\u2019s stated purpose of maximizing total system throughput, which was different from the Philips proposal\u2019s stated objective of reducing errors in transmission of the most significant bits (MSBs) of the CQI. The Board found that an ordinarily skilled artisan would not have been motivated to modify the Philips proposal to maximize system throughput, and therefore that the challenged claims of the \u2019718 patent had not been shown to be obvious. The Federal Circuit explained that the Board committed legal error by considering only the problem expressed in the patent itself, which ran counter to Supreme Court precedent that any known motivation to modify the prior art could support an obviousness challenge. Here, the prior art Philips proposal itself stated that it was desirable to reduce transmission errors in the most significant bits, and the effect of transposing the final two bits in Philips\u2019 conversion table\u2014that is, the modification claimed in the \u2019718 patent\u2014would have been to maximize protection of the most significant bit at the expense of the second-most significant bit. The majority thus found that the Board\u2019s contrary determination\u2014that there was no motivation to modify Philips\u2014was not supported by substantial evidence. The majority found that the Board\u2019s decision was premised on several other errors, and ultimately reversed the Board\u2019s ruling that the challenged claims had not been shown to be obvious.\n\nJudge Stoll dissented. She agreed with portions of the majority\u2019s reasoning, but argued the decision should have been vacated and remanded instead of reversed. In her view, the majority\u2019s \u201cclear error\u201d review crossed the line into impermissibly weighing evidence and finding facts, which should have been left to the Board on remand. Judge Stoll also faulted the majority for considering only claim 1 of the \u2019718 patent and not the other challenged claims, notwithstanding the parties had treated claim 1 as representative and argued only that claim on appeal.\n\nThe full opinion can be found here.\n\nBy Jason A.

            "content": "Welcome to 2025, which I hope will be a year of accomplishment and good health for the entire ATL readership. As patent litigation aficionados, is there a better way to start the year than to take a close look at the first Federal Circuit decision released? I can\u2019t think of one, especially when the decision in question was deemed precedential \u2014 and had a dissenting opinion as well. Add in that the decision reiterated some important considerations on one of patent law\u2019s cardinal issues, obviousness, and it is clear that this first effort from the CAFC in 2025 is worth our attention. So let\u2019s dive in.\n\nTo start, it helps to know the backstory of the patent that the CAFC considered on appeal. The patent owner and appellee, 3G Licensing S.A., is a subsidiary of Sisvel, a well-known player in the patent monetization space. While the \u201c3G Joint Licensing Programme\u201d that 3G Licensing managed \u201cis no longer active\u201d according to Sisvel\u2019s website, Sisvel claims to still have over a dozen \u201cactive licensing programmes\u201d and over 1,500 patents owned. At issue in the appeal was the PTAB\u2019s 2022 decision upholding the validity of 3G\u2019s \u2018718 patent, which 3G had acquired from LG Electronics in February 2020. As is often the case with experienced patent monetization outfits, that acquisition was swiftly followed by assertion, in the form of a May 2020 complaint against Honeywell.\n\nIn response, Honeywell and other 3G licensing targets filed an IPR against the \u2018718 patent, arguing that there was \u201cnothing inventive about the encoding scheme claimed in the \u2019718 patent; rather, the basis sequences and mathematical operations claimed by LGE are a trivial, and obvious, modification of a prior art proposal by Koninklijke Philips N.V.\u201d According to the IPR petition, \u201cthe only difference between the prior art and the \u2019718 patent is that the last two bits of the last row of the basis sequences are flip-flopped,\u201d so that 98 out of 100 bits were identical between the basis sequences disclosed in the prior art and the \u2018718 patent. Still, the PTAB refused to find the \u2018718 patent obvious, leading to the CAFC appeal under discussion.\n\nAs characterized by the majority, the thrust of the \u2018718 patent involved methods for optimizing the accuracy of the information based from a cellphone to a base station regarding signal strength, characterized in the art as the Channel Quality Indicator or CQI. The more accurate the CQI information, the better the performance of the communication system. As with many other aspects of wireless communication, a standard formed around CQI transmission. In support of that effort, a decision was taken to extend the encoder length by four bits, raising the question of how best to handle that extension in a way that \u201cwould reduce the probability that transmission errors would result in large errors in the received channel quality value.\u201d\n\nThe initial solution to the question of how to avoid errors in CQI transmission was suggested by Philips, whose submitted proposal became the key prior art reference to the \u2018718 patent. For its part, LG filed a Korean application that led to the \u2018718 patent shortly after the publication of the Philips reference, whereby LG, \u201ctwo days after filing the Korean patent application \u2026 proposed a modification to the Philips reference flipping the last two digits in the table, as disclosed in the Korean patent application.\u201d That proposal was approved, so that the \u2018718 patent \u201ceffectively claimed the TGPP standard for encoding CQI.\u201d Needless to say, patents that claim standards are valuable, unless they are invalid.\n\nWith that background, the majority turned to its review of the PTAB\u2019s decision upholding the \u2018718 patent\u2019s validity, even as it \u201cacknowledged that the only difference between the Philips reference and the claim 1 was that the 1 and 0 in the last row of the basis sequences table were switched.\u201d In reversing the PTAB, the majority identified \u201cmultiple legal errors\u201d starting with the conclusion that one of skill in the art \u201cwould not have been motivated to modify the Philips reference to swap the bits to improve protection for the MSB because the \u2019718 patent\u2019s main objective was to maximize entire system throughput.\u201d Citing the seminal obviousness decision, KSR, the majority upbraided the PTAB for forgetting \u201cthat the motivation to modify a prior art reference to arrive at the claimed invention need not be the same motivation that the patentee had.\u201d Next, the majority focused on the fact that even 3G\u2019s expert \u201cdid not dispute that swapping the last-row digits would increase protection to the MSB and instead simply disputed whether it was understood that doing so would have been desirable.\u201d As a result, the majority found that the PTAB\u2019s decision was \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence\u201d as it ignored the unrebutted expert opinion \u201cthat swapping the two digits in the basis sequence would repeat the MSB an additional time and provide increased protection to the MSB.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the majority took issue with the fact that the PTAB appeared to apply the stricter anticipation invalidity standard to the petition, rather than considering the arguments based on the obviousness standard that was actually argued. Likewise, the majority also criticized the PTAB\u2019s decision upholding validity to the the extent that it failed to \u201crecognize that the claimed modification needed only to be desirable in light of the prior art and not the \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018preferred\u2019 approach\u201d \u2014 with the Philips reference itself disclosing the motivation for the modification claimed in the \u2018718 patent.\n\nIn dissent, Judge Stoll agreed with the majority that the PTAB \u201cerroneously conflated obviousness with anticipation\u201d in evaluating the import of the Philips reference\u2019s failure to propose the two-bit swap disclosed in the \u2018718 patent. For Stoll, the proper disposition of the appeal would have been a remand to the PTAB, not the reversal entered by the majority. In her view, the majority\u2019s reversal overstepped the role of the appellate court, as the underlying case \u201cpresents a close factual dispute of whether Honeywell proved by preponderant evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to swap the last two bits in Philips\u2019 basis sequence table without making other changes to the table\u201d \u2014 and the CAFC is not a fact finder. Instead, it is the job of the PTAB \u201cto make fact findings about what a person of ordinary skill in art would understand a prior art reference to teach in this case\u201d \u2014 a mandate that the majority took away with its reversal.\n\nUltimately, this decision highlights the continued importance of the CAFC in terms of policing the PTAB and making sure that its precedents are being followed on key issues like obviousness. At the same time, the dissent raises the question \u2014 not for the first time, as any CAFC watcher knows \u2014 of whether CAFC panels are too quick to make factual findings that support their desired conclusions, even when those actions conflict with principles of appellate review. We are just getting started in 2025 and there is already a strong example of obvious disagreement to digest.\n\nPlease feel free to send comments or questions to me at [email protected] or via Twitter: @gkroub.

            "content": "That's why we tested 56 ultrasonic and evaporative humidifiers in our lab and at home for six months. During this process, we looked for picks that were effective, stylish, easy to clean, and offered a long runtime. Stick around for our top picks that will help you breathe easy this winter.\n\nWhether the air is already dry or a running heater is sucking the moisture out of your space, a humidifier can help. Adding moisture to the air can relieve dry skin and respiratory issues, especially for people in colder climates. With so many options on the market\u2014warm mist, cool mist, ultrasonic, evaporative, and more\u2014finding the right choice can be challenging.\n\nIt\u2019s compatible with tap water, so it\u2019s low maintenance and easy to refill on the go.\n\nDespite its small size, this humidifier has a surprisingly long runtime\u2014about eight hours on the continuous setting. Just keep in mind that it does take four hours to fully charge, so you\u2019ll want to plan accordingly before you use it. You can also opt for the intermittent setting, which we found a bit stronger (and noisier) than the continuous one. While it\u2019s not designed for larger spaces, we think its compact design, tap water compatibility, and impressive battery life make it a great personal option.\n\nOverall, we found this humidifier to be very low maintenance. Since it works best with tap water, you can refill it almost anywhere. The clear window on the tank, along with the backlight, made it easy to monitor the water level. Cleaning took less than two minutes\u2014just wash and rinse it with mild soap and water as you would any cup or mug. We did notice some buildup around the nozzle over time, but a quick wipe with a cotton swab took care of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a personal humidifier to pamper your skin, the Hey Dewy Wireless Facial Humidifier is the perfect choice. Its compact design makes it portable and travel-friendly, so you can easily take it to your desk, bedroom, or even on your commute (it fits in most cup holders). It also operates quietly, even on higher settings, producing only a faint hum. Six months later, and we still have no complaints.\n\nIt's compact and tap water compatible, making it easy to bring on the go.\n\nCleaning was relatively straightforward, and the removable tank with a handle made refilling easy and mess free. We did notice some film buildup around the base where water drains into the machine, but regular maintenance resolved the issue. We especially love how discreet it is\u2014thanks to its compact design and quiet operation, we\u2019d forget it was running if not for the visible vapor.\n\nYou can choose between the low, medium, and high settings by clicking the mist button\u2014one light indicates the low setting, while three lights indicate the high setting. When we first turned it on, we had to sit about 2 feet away to feel the moisture. However, during our four- and eight-hour check-ins, we immediately felt the difference as soon as we entered the room. On the highest setting, it ran for about 12 hours before needing to be refilled, making it a great option for uninterrupted overnight use. You can also add essential oils.\n\nThe corresponding smartphone app allows you to adjust the mist level, set schedules and timers, and monitor performance from anywhere. It also has an auto mode that keeps the humidity at an ideal level, between 40% and 60%. Plus, you can sync it with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nLooking for a customizable, high-tech humidifier? The Levoit OasisMist is a must-have. During testing, we found the humidifier noticeably effective on any setting. We've been using it for six months, and it's become a staple in our nighttime routine.\n\nYou can adjust the settings from anywhere using the app.\n\nIt takes less than five minutes to clean using soap, water, and the included brush.\n\nIt has three settings, which you can adjust using the button on the front.\n\nSince there\u2019s no window, it\u2019s difficult to gauge the water level until the indicator shows it.\n\nTo fill the Canopy Portable Humidifer\u2019s water tank, you need to turn the top piece upside down.\n\nIt has three mist settings ranging from low to high. We found the output fairly strong given its size, but it isn\u2019t likely to change a large room\u2019s overall humidity. While it\u2019s not ideal for large-scale humidification, its portability, quiet operation, and aromatherapy make it a versatile option for vacations and road trips.\n\nIts sleek design and small footprint make it ideal for smaller spaces, like bedrooms, office desks, or even on the go, and the nearly silent operation is non-disruptive in public settings. We also love that it\u2019s compatible with essential oils, with the ceramic stone included for aromatherapy. Plus, the steel filter, water tank, and tank cap are all dishwasher safe. Our only complaint? The water tank visibility. Since the water line isn\u2019t visible, you\u2019ll have to manually monitor when it needs a refill.\n\nWhether you\u2019re going on a long vacation or a weekend road trip, we recommend the Canopy Portable Humidifier. It\u2019s the perfect solution for travelers (it\u2019s TSA-approved for your carry-on luggage ) or anyone looking for a compact, space-saving humidifier. No more dry airplane air? Yes, please. After four months of daily use, it's still exceeding our expectations.\n\nThe simple device has just one setting, which is easily adjustable using the knob.\n\nAs the largest model on our list, this model doesn't fit beneath most bathroom sinks.\n\nThe Levoit Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier has an impressive runtime, thanks to its large capacity.\n\nThis model was super easy to use, clean, and adjust. We also appreciate its large water reservoir, which lasted for two or three nights before needing a refill. The tradeoff, though, is that it does take up a fair amount of space, making it a bit tricky to find an ideal home for it when you\u2019re using it regularly. The opaque water tank made it easy to view the water line, the filter was easy to replace, and the wide-mouth top-fill design was easy to refill without spills. If you\u2019re seeking a basic, no-frills humidifier, this one is a real steal.\n\nWith just one setting, it doesn\u2019t have all the bells and whistles of more advanced models, but we found the single brightness setting to be low and non-disruptive. Its soft, soothing LED nightlight is perfect for a bedroom or nursery, and for those who prefer a blackout bedroom, you can switch the nightlight off.\n\nHumidifiers can be expensive, but the Levoit Top Filled Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice quality for the price. While the low setting wasn\u2019t very strong\u2014 it took about 15 minutes for us to feel the effects on the lowest setting\u2014the higher setting produced a much greater output. When we put it on our dresser, across the room from our bed, we still felt the impact. After four months of use, it's still just as powerful.\n\nThis model increased our room\u2019s humidity by over 20% on both the high and low settings.\n\nConsidering this model has an internal fan, we found it surprisingly quiet, producing just a subtle, non-disruptive noise. What we really loved, though, is that all parts that come in contact with water are dishwasher safe, making it low maintenance and easy to clean. We found the water reservoir easy to remove and bring to the sink for a refill. Filter replacement was a bit more tedious, though\u2014you\u2019ll need to replace it every 30 to 60 days depending on the type of water you\u2019re using.\n\nUnlike ultrasonic models, evaporative humidifiers use a moistened filter and fan to distribute cool mist evenly throughout the room. After running the Honeywell Cool Moisture in a small bedroom for eight hours each night, we saw an increase in humidity by an average of 33% on the highest setting and 24% on the lowest setting. It ran for two to three nights before needing a refill. And, despite being a budget-friendly option, it definitely doesn\u2019t skimp on durability\u2014after six months of use, it\u2019s still in great shape.\n\nIt was surprisingly quiet and ran for three nights before needing a refill.\n\nYou can adjust the mode and light settings from a distance using the remote.\n\nIt has an impressive output, increasing our room\u2019s humidity by 11% on the lowest setting.\n\nThe water tank\u2019s handle made it easy to carry from room to room. The setup is also super intuitive\u2014the clear window allows for easy water level tracking, and the top-fill design ensures a spill-free refill process. Overall, this device\u2019s powerful output, ease of use, and several settings make it an excellent choice.\n\nIt was fairly quiet on the lowest setting, but whirring noises were constant on the medium and highest settings. While we found the sounds soothing, those looking for a quieter operation might prefer a different option.\n\nWe love the features packed into this little machine, including a long 40-hour run time, optional LED lights, and a humidistat to track the room\u2019s humidity levels. It comes with a variety of modes, including sleep mode, auto mode, light mode, and even meditation mode. Plus, you can set it to run for anywhere between two to 12 hours using the timer.\n\nThe Miko Myst Ultrasonic Humidifier checks all the boxes of a great humidifier: It\u2019s effective, versatile, and easy to use. After leaving it running for a few hours with the door closed, the remote had condensation on it. We were similarly amazed by its performance on the lowest setting, which increased our room\u2019s humidity by 11% in just a few hours. Four months later, and we're still impressed by its strong output.\n\nIt runs for up to 40 hours and comes with LED lights, aromatherapy, and guided meditation.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nOur top ultrasonic humidifier is the Miko Myst for its impressive output, long runtime, and various settings (including a meditation mode). If you\u2019re looking for an evaporative humidifier, we recommend the Honeywell Cool Moisture Humidifier, which is effective on both the highest and lowest settings.\n\nWe looked for humidifiers with easily removable reservoirs. Real Simple\n\nOur Testing Process\n\nTo find the best humidifiers, we tested 56 of the most popular models in our lab and at home. First, we set up of each humidifier, assessing how difficult the process was and how long it took. We also filled the water tank to its capacity with distilled water, noting how heavy the tank was when full.\n\nOnce the water tanks were full, we measured the effectiveness of each humidifier by running it for eight hours straight on both the highest and lowest setting and recorded the humidity level of the room before and after. We also considered how loud each unit was and whether it made any humming, whistling, or crackling noises. Once we turned the humidifiers off, we checked the surrounding area for any puddling or leaking.\n\nDuring this process, we paid attention to the design of each humidifier, considering whether it blends in well with its surroundings, how user-friendly the display is, and if it includes any smart features. We also took size into account, noting how much room it takes up, whether the cord is long enough to reach the outlet, and how long it runs before needing a refill.\n\nAfter each use, we emptied and cleaned the tank, evaluating how easy it was to clean. Finally, we rated the overall value of each humidifier based on whether its performance justified the price. Once lab testing was complete, we brought the humidifiers home and tested them over six months to evaluate how well they held up to daily use.\n\nMost models on our list have top-fill designs\u2014just remove the lid and pour in the water. Real Simple\n\nHow to Shop for Humidifiers Like a Pro\n\nType\n\nThere are two main kinds of humidifiers: cool mist and warm mist. Warm mist humidifiers use boiling water and release steam into the room, making them ideal for cold winter months. However, they require more frequent cleaning and can be dangerous for homes with children and pets. Cool mist humidifiers, on the other hand, release room-temperature air back into the room.\n\nCool mist humidifiers can be either evaporative or ultrasonic. Evaporative humidifiers use a fan to evaporate water in a moistened filter, and because of the fan, they are usually a bit noisier. However, they\u2019re more energy efficient and somewhat self-regulating\u2014as the humidity in the room increases, the evaporation naturally decreases. Ultrasonic humidifiers use a vibrating diaphragm to disperse a fine mist into the air. They operate more quietly than evaporative humidifiers and don\u2019t use a filter.\n\nSimple models, like the Levoit Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier, adjust with a simple knob turn. Real Simple\n\nSize and Capacity\n\nWhen shopping for a humidifier, the \u201csize specification\u201d you\u2019ll see refers to the maximum room it could effectively humidify, while the capacity\u2014usually measured in milliliters, liters, or gallons\u2014refers to the size of the water tank. Generally, larger rooms will require a humidifier with a bigger tank. While the tank capacity doesn\u2019t directly affect its runtime, it does determine how often you\u2019ll need to refill it.\n\nNoise Level\n\nDepending on when and where you plan to use your humidifier, noise level is important to consider. If you\u2019re using it in your office or overnight in the bedroom, you\u2019ll want a model that\u2019s quiet and non-disruptive. Ultrasonic humidifiers are typically the quietest, while evaporative humidifiers tend to be a bit louder because of the running fan.\n\nNoise levels often correlate with settings\u2014the higher the setting, the louder the noise. It\u2019s also worth noting that inconsistent sounds, like dripping sounds or intermittent misting, can be more noticeable. Continuous settings, on the other hand, often become white noise that\u2019s less noticeable. Generally, a noise level of 30 to 40 decibels provides a low, unobtrusive hum.\n\nAs you increase the setting, humidifiers tend to become louder. Real Simple\n\nCleanup\n\nDifferent humidifiers require different levels of maintenance, and the manufacturer will indicate how to best care for them. Generally, you clean your humidifier weekly and change the water regularly to discourage mold and bacteria. You may need to do these more or less often, depending on the frequency of use. Some humidifiers have a sanitization function to assist with this. If you\u2019re storing your humidifier or using it infrequently, make sure you empty and clean it before storing it.\n\nHumidistat\n\nSome humidifiers come with a built-in humidistat that detects and monitors a room\u2019s humidity levels. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends keeping indoor humidity between 30% and 50%. Many models also feature auto settings, which sense the room\u2019s humidity and automatically adjust output to maintain the ideal level.\n\nMore Humidifiers to Consider\n\nClorox Easy Clean Humidifier: We found this humidifier easy to set up, use, and clean, and noticed a significant humidity increase on all settings. However, we did observe some residue when using tap water, as well as an occasional dripping noise.\n\nCrane Cool Mist Top Load Humidifier and Aroma Diffuser: With a large tank capacity and powerful output, the Crane Cool Mist humidifier is an excellent choice for larger spaces. We also appreciate its easy operation and convenient auto mode, which helped maintain our ideal humidity level. That said, we found it a bit heavy and difficult to clean.\n\nSome options feature LED light settings for ambiance.

Air purifiers can trap dust, pet dander, smoke, and harmful particles \u2013 but choosing the right one means navigating a maze of terms like HEPA filters, CADR ratings, and room coverage specs. We\u2019ve combed through expert reviews of the top models across all price points to help you breathe easier with this list of the best air purifiers. Did we miss one you like? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nStudyFinds is a research-driven platform that analyzes and synthesizes expert recommendations from trusted sources. Rather than writing reviews ourselves, we meticulously compile consensus findings from leading industry experts and established publications to save consumers valuable research time. Each article represents hours of analysis across multiple authoritative sources to identify the most consistently recommended choices.\n\nTop 5 Air Purifiers, According to Experts\n\nCoway Airmega AP-1512HH\n\nThe Coway Airmega AP-1512HH has earned its crown as the air purifier to beat, according to The New York Times, with reviewers that love its versatility in spaces from bedrooms to living rooms. Its secret weapon? A triple-threat filtration system that U.S. News highlights \u2013 featuring a washable pre-filter for the big stuff like pet hair, a True HEPA filter for those invisible nasties, and an activated carbon filter that tackles unwanted odors.\n\nWhat really makes this purifier shine is its ability to handle rooms up to 361 square feet while still being compact enough for smaller spaces like dorm rooms. CNET\u2018s testing reveals a particularly clever feature: the eco mode, which automatically shuts off the fan after 30 minutes of clean air readings to save energy, only spinning back up when new particles are detected.\n\nThe Airmega stands out from the crowd by combining both HEPA and ionic technology \u2013 a dual-approach system that CNET says is rare in the market. It\u2019s this kind of smart engineering, paired with its proven durability and economic operation, that keeps this model at the top of review lists.\n\nBlueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto\n\nAccording to Tom\u2019s Guide\u2018s rigorous testing, the cube-shaped Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Auto stands head and shoulders above its competitors, particularly in its ability to efficiently clean large spaces while keeping both energy use and noise levels impressively low.\n\nWhat makes this purifier particularly impressive is its triple-threat filtration system, which Good Housekeeping says is ideal for homes battling multiple air quality issues. The fabric filter tackles dust, while a true HEPA filter removes smaller particles like mold and bacteria, and a carbon-activated filter deals with odors from cooking, pets, and smoke. All this power comes together to clean 99.97% of common airborne pollutants in rooms up to 540 square feet \u2013 perfect for a family room or master bedroom.\n\nThe real genius of this machine, as Wired discovered, lies in its intelligent design. While it runs whisper-quiet on its lowest setting, it\u2019s equipped with a smart sensor that automatically kicks the fan speed up when it detects particles. This means it\u2019s quietly but effectively working around the clock, even adjusting itself from low to high speed overnight to maintain optimal air quality.\n\nHoneywell HPA300 HEPA Air Purifier\n\nFor those seeking serious air-cleaning power without breaking the bank, the Honeywell HPA300 HEPA Air Purifier is a standout performer. Insider endorses it as the top choice for medium-to-large spaces, and it\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 this powerhouse can tackle rooms up to 2,250 square feet in under an hour.\n\nDespite its impressive coverage area, Esquire points out that the Honeywell maintains a surprisingly compact and quiet profile. What really catches attention is its three-tier air-cleaning system, which efficiently traps everything from microscopic allergens to pet hair, pollen, and smoke particles. The combination of performance and affordability makes it particularly appealing for larger homes or offices where air quality is a priority.\n\nFor anyone dealing with allergies or air quality concerns in bigger spaces, this Honeywell model offers industrial-strength filtration in a surprisingly accessible package. The ability to purify such a large area while keeping noise levels down makes it a practical choice for both day and night use, proving that effective air purification doesn\u2019t have to come with a luxury price tag.\n\nLevoit Core 400S\n\nThe Levoit 400S is another top pick among experts, with Live Science reporting it captured up to 100% of airborne particles in testing. The sleek cylindrical design features a color-coded display for real-time air quality monitoring, and it\u2019s clearly winning over users \u2013 earning five stars from 85% of Amazon reviewers.\n\nSafewise says this purifier is an ideal bedroom companion, noting its ultra-quiet operation and space-saving design that\u2019s perfect for dresser placement. It efficiently cycles through 400 square feet of air five times per hour, and thoughtful features like a fully dimmable LED display make it especially suitable for light-sensitive sleepers.\n\nThis combination of powerful filtration and user-friendly design makes the Levoit 400S particularly appealing for those seeking both performance and practicality. Its ability to run whisper-quiet while maintaining high-efficiency cleaning, plus its modern aesthetic, positions it as a smart choice for bedrooms, nurseries, or any space where clean air and peaceful operation are priorities.\n\nDyson Purifier Humidify+Cool\n\nFor those seeking an all-in-one air solution, Dyson\u2019s multitasking marvel delivers triple functionality as a purifier, cooler, and humidifier. The Spruce\u2018s testing reveals impressive results, with noticeable air quality improvements within just five minutes. The device combines H13 HEPA and activated carbon filtration across 10 power levels for customizable performance.\n\nArchitectural Digest\u2018s hands-on experience confirms the machine\u2019s effectiveness, noting that even when air quality dips from cooking or candles, the purifier quickly restores balance. The automatic purification mode is particularly clever, ramping up fan speed automatically when sensors detect declining air quality.\n\nWhat sets this Dyson apart is its ability to excel at multiple functions without compromising on any single one. While it commands a premium price point, its three-in-one capability and sophisticated sensor system make it an efficient space-saving solution for those who want comprehensive air treatment in a single sleek package.\n\nNote: This article was not paid for nor sponsored.

            "content": "Ideally, picking the right AC unit is a rare chore \u2014 but that all depends on whether you choose a unit that will last you for years to come. Luckily, there's plenty of data that makes it clear which brands are likely to have major issues. A few air conditioner brands to avoid at all costs include Arctic King, Honeywell, Luxaire, Coleman, and York.\n\nMany brands only offer certain types of air conditioning. So before you narrow down brands, it makes sense to determine the right type and size of air conditioner for your needs first. The four most common types of AC are window units, portable air conditioners, mini-splits, and central AC systems. The former two are usually less expensive and easy to install yourself, while the latter two are pricier and require professional installation. Central AC systems send cool air through air ducts, while mini-splits don't require ductwork and are often more efficient. As for size, look for the number of BTUs, or British thermal units (BTUs). To effectively cool a space, you need 12,000 BTUs per 1,000 square feet. Many high-quality models will also carry an Energy Star rating, a sign of their higher energy efficiency.\n\nAfter that, finding a quiet, reliable, and effective unit is all about choosing the right brand and model. After reviewing Consumer Reports data, customer reviews, and professional opinions, we determined that Arctic King, Honeywell, Luxaire, Coleman, and York are the brands most worth avoiding. Instead, consider units from Midea, Trane, Lennox, American Standard, or Mitsubishi.",

The win marked Australia\u2019s first series triumph over India in ten years and ensured their place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final against South Africa at Lord\u2019s in June.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChasing 162 for victory, Usman Khawaja anchored the innings with a steady 41 at the top before Travis Head (34*) and debutant Beau Webster (39*) saw Australia home in just 27 overs. Prasidh Krishna (3/65) and Mohammed Siraj (1/69) picked up wickets for India but failed to sustain pressure, making it an easy chase for the hosts.\n\nEarlier in the day, India was bundled out for a mere 157 runs in their second innings. Rishabh Pant\u2019s valiant 61 was the lone bright spot in an otherwise disappointing batting display. Scott Boland delivered a spectacular spell, claiming 6/45, with captain Pat Cummins adding 3/44 to skittle India out within 40 overs. Reflecting on his performance, Boland said, \u201cTo win 3-1 against India hasn\u2019t been done in a while. I\u2019m happy playing whenever I can, and the last few weeks have been awesome.\u201d\n\nJasprit Bumrah, who was named Player of the Series for his remarkable 32 wickets, couldn\u2019t bowl in the final innings due to back spasms, leaving a glaring gap in India\u2019s attack. A disappointed Bumrah admitted, \u201cLittle frustrating, but sometimes you have to respect your body. This series was hard-fought, and while we didn\u2019t win, the youngsters gained a lot of experience.\u201d\n\nAustralia captain Pat Cummins hailed his team\u2019s effort, saying, \u201cUnreal. Few of us didn\u2019t have this Trophy. It\u2019s been a special series. Beating India required us to step up, and everyone delivered. This will go down as one of my favorite Test series.\u201d\n\nThe defeat dashed India\u2019s hopes of reaching the WTC final, as they finished third with a PCT of 50.00. The loss also exposed India\u2019s over-reliance on Bumrah and their batting frailties, raising questions about the team\u2019s future strategy.",

            "content": "As the winter season settles in, coughs and colds and an overall dry, parched feeling come along with it. Things such as drinking tea, taking vitamins, and getting enough rest is a big part of making it through another uncomfortable season. Here are 6 must-have items to make it through the dry winter season.\n\nWinter Essentials to Survive the Season\n\nHumidifier\n\nA humidifier should be at the top of the list of winter essentials to get you through the dry winter season. This compact device literally puts moisture back into the air by means of water vapour. Humidifiers can help to soothe common winter ailments such as dry sinuses, sore throats, bloody noses, and cracked lips. Plus, they may also help ease symptoms of a cold or other respiratory condition, and can even help in preventing the spread of influenza, according to one study .\n\nWith children in the house, it\u2019s best to avoid steam vaporizers as the hot water inside can cause burns if spilled. Stick to a cool-mist humidifier for best results. Brands such as Vicks , Honeywell , and HoMedics all have high ratings from Consumer Reports .\n\nAdditionally, always follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for maintaining your humidifier in order to avoid potential problems such as mold or too high humidity levels.\n\nHand Cream\n\nNothing says winter like the sting of dry, cracked hands. Add in increased hand-washing as a result of COVID-19 and influenza season, and a quality hand cream is another must have for your winter essentials list of supplies.\n\nHand cream works by adding and keeping moisture within the skin. Ingredients such as occlusives (lanolin, mineral oil, silicone) hold water in, while humectants (glycerin, honey, aloe vera) draw in water, and emollients (plant oils, mineral oils, shea and cocoa butter) fill in rough spots.\n\nBack in 2020, Global News did an extensive evaluation of many popular hand creams and found Eucerin Aquaphor Healing Ointment , Burt\u2019s Bees Shea Butter Hand Repair Cream , and Lush Helping Hands hand creams to be some of the best performing options.\n\nThroat Lozenges\n\nWhen a sore throat hits \u2014 whether from a cold or a dry environment \u2014 a throat lozenge can help provide relief. Additionally, there\u2019s research that suggests taking high dose zinc lozenges at the onset of a cold may help reduce symptoms.\n\nOur family prefers the Ricola brand, which is safe for kids and contains a tincture of 10 organic herbs. For kids who prefer a less intense sensation, Cepacol Children\u2019s Fruity Strawberry, Sore Throat lozenges are also a hit in our house.\n\nVitamins\n\nWhile a nutritious diet is certainly the best way to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs, there are some supplements that can help, should you find yourself under the weather. Studies have shown that vitamin C can help to reduce the duration and the severity of the common cold for both adults and children alike, and those who supplement with zinc within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms experience a decrease of approximately 33% in the duration of their cold.\n\nAdditionally, there have been many clinical trials that found that regular supplementation with probiotics provides protective effects against influenza infection. Plus, it can lower your chance of catching the common cold, while reducing the severity of your symptoms and cold duration if you start taking it at the first sign of symptoms.\n\nTea\n\nWhen winter dryness or a cold hits, put on the kettle and let a hot cup of tea ease your symptoms. The warmth of a hot cuppa is soothing for dry, sore throats, and also helps to keep you hydrated. Kids can enjoy caffeine-free herbal teas such as chamomile and mint, while adults can benefit from the immune-boosting properties of green and black teas.\n\nNeti Pot/Nasal Aspirator\n\nNasal congestion is not only uncomfortable during the day, but it can also make sleep at night a real challenge, especially for little ones who haven\u2019t fully mastered their nose-blowing technique. A neti pot or nasal aspirator can be a real saviour for these times.\n\nWhile younger tots aren\u2019t likely to tolerate the sensation of a neti pot, for older kids and parents, it offers an effective, medication-free means of clearing the sinuses. The Himalayan Chandra is a popular choice, while I can personally vouch for the ease and effectiveness of the NeilMed Sinus Rinse Kit .",

            "content": "Volocopter\u2014the manufacturer of a two-seat, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi it expects to fly paying customers later this year\u2014is out of cash.\n\nThe firm last week filed for insolvency at a court in Germany, where it is based, as it searches for new investors. Tobias Wahl, the company\u2019s court-appointed attorney, said in a news release that it would develop a \u201crestructuring concept\u201d to be shared with investors by the end of February.\n\n\u201cWe are ahead of our industry peers in our technological, flight-test, and certification progress,\u201d said Dirk Hoke, the outgoing CEO of Volocopter who announced his resignation in September. \u201cThat makes us an attractive company to invest in while we organize ourselves with internal restructuring.\u201d\n\nThe news comes just two months after air taxi competitor Lilium, also based in Germany, ran out of money itself. In December, the firm said it was nearing a deal that would allow it to restart the business this month.\n\nBurning Cash\n\nAccording to SMG Consulting\u2019s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Reality Index, Volocopter has raised more than $750 million from private backers including Mercedes-Benz, Honeywell, and Blackrock. The company did not disclose the investors or value of its most recent funding raise in June, according to The Air Current. It claims to have \u201cone of the lowest burn rates in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, despite recent intensive fundraising efforts, finding a viable solution to maintain regular operations outside of insolvency proceedings has not been possible,\u201d the company said on Monday.\n\nElectric air taxi manufacturers have raised billions of dollars in private capital over the past decade, but they have little to show for it. Savanthi Syth, an analyst for Raymond James, in November predicted to Reuters that Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, Eve Air Mobility, and Vertical Aerospace\u2014four of the largest such companies\u2014would burn a combined $1 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nAnd so far, that money is contributing only to aircraft development, manufacturing, and certification. No eVTOL air taxi has flown passengers\u2014let alone received FAA certification\u2014in the U.S. China\u2019s EHang is the first and only company to operate eVTOL passenger flights, though those operations remain in their infancy.\n\nFoiled Plans\n\nLike EHang\u2019s EH216-S, Volocopter\u2019s VoloCity has two seats. It is designed for a pilot to fly a single passenger at a cruise speed approaching 60 knots, with a range just under 20 nm. The company is working with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to secure the necessary approvals to operate VoloCity as a commercial aircraft, including type certification.\n\nThat authorization would have allowed Volocopter to demonstrate the model\u2019s passenger-carrying capabilities during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, a goal it fell short of achieving. Instead, it completed a handful of uncrewed test flights and contended with pushback from local officials, who even took legal action against the demonstrations.\n\nVolocopter and partner Groupe ADP, which manages Paris region airports, told Agence France-Presse in August that they planned for VoloCity to fly passengers over the river Seine by December. But that too failed to pan out.\n\nThe struggles of Volocopter and Lilium, which also filed for insolvency in 2024, don\u2019t necessarily reflect the state of the larger eVTOL air taxi space. But they could be a sign of consolidation to come. Robin Riedel, who co-leads the Center for Future Mobility at McKinsey, told FLYING that private investment in eVTOL actually doubled from 2023 to 2024, with $3.1 billion raised through mid-December.\n\n\u201cHowever, while funding was up overall, 2024 was a tale of two industries: some large players, in particular Archer and Joby, as well as Chinese players received much of the additional funding,\u201d Riedel said. \u201cOthers struggled to attract investors and as a result are facing restructuring or shut-down.\u201d\n\nJoby and Archer, in particular, are helped by airline partnerships with Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines, respectively. They also have the backing of the U.S. government, which is evaluating Joby\u2019s S4 and Archer\u2019s Midnight for military use.\n\nVolocopter\u2019s lone U.S. operating partner is Houston-based Bristow Group, which primarily flies helicopters. The manufacturer also has an agreement with Japan Airlines to study eVTOL air taxi services in Japan.\n\nThe company said business operations with those collaborators and others will \u201ccontinue as usual\u201d during insolvency proceedings.",

The appellate court also nixed Purdue Pharma\u2019s arguments on secondary considerations as either unconnected to the invalidated patent claims or already properly considered by the district court. As to the low-toxicity oxycodone formulation claims, the Federal Circuit rejected Purdue Pharma\u2019s argument that it discovered the claimed impurity created during synthesis of oxycodone, and that routine experimentation would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to confirm the existence of the impurity as claimed.\n\nIssa to Lead House IP Subcommittee During 119th Congress \u2013 On Monday, December 30, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) announced leadership assignments for the subcommittees of the House Judiciary Committee, including Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) to serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, Artificial Intelligence, and the Internet.\n\nNinth Circuit Affirms $56 Million Trademark Verdict Against Molson\u2019s Keystone Campaign \u2013 On Monday, December 30, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling in Stone Brewing Co., LLC v.

The Ninth Circuit found that Stone Brewing properly brought its claims during the Lanham Act\u2019s four-year statute of limitations, that the record supported a reasonable likelihood of consumer confusion, that the admission of survey evidence and expert testimony challenged by Molson did not warrant a new trial, and that remittitur was not appropriate as Stone Brewing established that Molson\u2019s ad campaign affected sales of all of Stone\u2019s brands.\n\nThird Circuit OKs Dismissal of Copyright Claims Against Fanatics Hockey Memorabilia \u2013 On Friday, December 27, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued an opinion in Grondin v.

He was a fan of ACC sports and he proudly cheered his grandchildren on at their sports activities. He patiently listened to them and advised them on matters when counsel was sought. He was gifted with an extraordinary GPS built into his brain. He knew the highways and byways across America long before GPS services.\n\nEugene also loved the coast of North Carolina. Beach vacations with the family provided longtime memories and laughter, along with putt putt golf, sand sculptures, cooking, and fishing. Bluegrass music, whether enjoyed at a festival or listening at home, entertained Eugene with the music itself and the backstories of the entertainers and their songs.\n\nEugene was also a faithful member of Powers Memorial Baptist Church for many years.\n\nEugene is survived by his loving wife of 70 years, Edith Carver Clayton; his children, Shelby Clayton Salley and Gary P. Clayton; grandchildren, Andrew Salley, Meredith Hill, Trevor Clayton, and Troy Clayton; sisters, Nancy Clayton Bowles and Connie Clayton Penland (William); great-grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family will receive friends at the Hopewell Chapel of J.T.

            "content": "We came across a long thesis on Chemours Company (NYSE:CC) on ValueInvestorsClub by Glory_Warriors. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CC. The company\u2019s shares were trading at $18.69 when this thesis was published, vs. closing price of $16.90 on Dec 31st.\n\nChemours Company (NYSE:CC) is a global provider of chemicals, delivering customized solutions with a wide range of industrial and specialty chemicals products for various markets. The company was spun out of DuPont in 2015 and operates 3 segments: Thermal & Specialized Solutions \u2013 this segment produces refrigerants and foam blowing agents; Titanium Technologies \u2013 produces titanium dioxide (TiO\u2082), a white pigment used in paintings, coatings, plastics, cosmetics, etc.; Advanced Performance Materials \u2013 this segment produces fluorine-chemistry based polymers, coatings, resins and other materials that are used in electronics, communications, transportation, industrial and consumer end markets.\n\nThe investment thesis is centered around the argument that the Thermal & Specialized Solutions segment is poised to thrive as government regulations stimulate the transition from HFC-type refrigerants to the next-generation HFO refrigerants, which have significantly lower global warming potential. With Chemours Company (NYSE:CC) and Honeywell controlling a patented duopoly on HFO technology, the demand for these refrigerants is expected to rise despite recent market challenges, positioning the company to benefit from regulatory-driven tailwinds in 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, the author believes that Chemours Company (NYSE:CC) is well-positioned to become a leader in the emerging field of immersion cooling technology for data centers, by developing a fluid to be used in 2 Phase Immersion Cooling (2-PIC), which offers unparalleled cooling efficiency and significant reductions in the usage of energy, water and space. The company is clearly favored in this space as an early mover, which could result in a market leader position in a rapidly growing market.\n\nAll in all, the author believes that the aforementioned competitive position, coupled with decent execution from the management team, would result in superior EBITDA that would put the company\u2019s stock at $32.00 by the end of CY2026. From the current stock price, the target price implies 37.6% annualized return until the end of 2026.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "Choosing the best thermal paste may sound simple, but a dizzying array of options can turn this seemingly easy choice into a time-consuming and confusing task. Thermal paste is designed to minimize microscopic air gaps and irregularities between the surface of the cooler and the CPU's IHS (integrated heat spreader), the piece of metal built into the top of the processor, to transfer heat to the CPU cooler.\n\nGood thermal paste can have a profound impact on your performance because it will allow your processor to transfer more of its waste heat to your cooler, keeping your processor running cool. Choosing the best thermal paste is also important if you plan on overclocking your rig to its fullest. Even the best CPUs for gaming can often hit slightly higher CPU overclocks if paired with a good thermal paste.\n\nPerformance enthusiasts often swear by a favorite brand of paste, but new recipes crop up fairly frequently. We've extensively tested some of the top thermal pastes on the market. If you're hunting for more exotic pastes off the beaten path, we also have plenty of historical data below covering 90 different pastes (and yes, we've even tested toothpaste).\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThermal paste goes by many names, such as \"thermal compound,\" \"thermal grease,\" or \"TIM\" (Thermal Interface Material), but they all have the same purpose \u2014 to help keep your chip cool by ensuring that heat passes efficiently from the CPU to the cooler.\n\nMost pastes are made of ceramic or metallic materials suspended within a proprietary binder, allowing for easy application, spread, and cleanup. Depending on their specific formula, these thermal pastes can be electrically conductive or non-conductive. Electrically conductive thermal pastes can carry electricity between two points, meaning that if the paste squeezes out onto other components, it can cause damage to motherboards and CPUs when you switch on the power. A single drop out of place can lead to a dead PC, so extra care is imperative.\n\nLiquid metal compounds are almost always electrically conductive, so while these compounds perform better than their paste counterparts, they require more focus and attention during application. They are very hard to remove if you get some in the wrong place, which would fry your system. In contrast, traditional thermal paste compounds are relatively simple for every experience level. Most, but not all, traditional pastes are electrically non-conductive.\n\nEven though a dizzying array of different thermal pastes are available\u2014some blends have been around for over a decade\u2014new formulations still come to market at a surprising pace. As new pastes arrive, older pastes also retire.\n\nWe're also putting a new take on an old approach to the test \u2014 thermal pads. These pads can be used as a thermal paste and come as a single sheet you simply apply to your heatsink, with Thermaltake's Heilos Pad being the first new thermal pad entrant to see our test bed in the coming weeks.\n\nHere are the best thermal pastes, along with our complete test results. Remember that you don't always get what you pay for as some budget pastes come awfully close to or overtake their more expensive competitors.\n\nBest Thermal Paste for CPUs You Can Buy\n\nBest Premium (Standard) Thermal Paste\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nBest Premium (Standard) Thermal Paste\n\n(Image credit: Noctua)\n\n1. Noctua NT-H2 Best Premium Paste Specifications Electrically Conductive: No Thermal Conductivity: Unspecified Ease of Use: 4.5 (1=difficult, 5=simple) Relative Performance: 5.0 (1=poor, 5=excellent) Cleanup: lint-free absorbent paper towels (included), alcohol pads or cotton swabs and alcohol Price per gram: $3.70 (3.5g tube) Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Check Walmart Reasons to buy + Stability + Easy to use + Easy to clean up + Included Cleaning Towels + Low Price Reasons to avoid - None\n\nWhile many of Noctua\u2019s products carry premium price tags, like the NH-D15 G2 Air Cooler, when it comes to thermal pastes, Noctua\u2019s NT-H2 carries a relatively \u201cbudget\u201d price tag of only $12.95 for a 3.5G tube that also includes three cleaning wipes. Its thermal performance was very good. While it didn\u2019t take the top-ranking position in our charts, it was a negligible 0.3C away from the best result in our air cooling test system.\n\nBest Premium Thermal Paste (Runner Up)\n\nBest Premium Thermal Paste (Runner Up)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n2. ID-Cooling Frost X45 Runner Up: Best Premium Paste Specifications Electrically Conductive: No Thermal Conductivity: 15.2 W/mk Ease of Use: 4.5 (1=difficult, 5=simple) Relative Performance: 5.0 (1=poor, 5=excellent) Cleanup: lint-free absorbent paper towels, alcohol pads or cotton swabs and alcohol Price per gram: n/a Reasons to buy + Best performance + Stability + Easy to use + Easy to clean up Reasons to avoid - Limited availability\n\nID-Cooling\u2019s Frost X45 is the best-performing thermal paste we\u2019ve tested on our air cooling system, hands down. The biggest downside is its availability: This is a newly launched product, and currently, the only way to obtain this thermal paste is to purchase one of their newest AIOs, like the budget $60 FX360 Pro . However, it should be on storefronts like Amazon and Newegg (see Newegg promo codes) in the near future.\n\n(Image credit: Thermalright)\n\n3.

With our air cooling results, PTM7950 had the best results of any non-liquid metal compound. Its primary downside is longer burn-in times. We recommend giving it a strong thermal test after application to ensure you're getting the best results.\n\nBest Thermal Pad (Runner Up)\n\n(Image credit: Amazon)\n\n5.

It can be reused if removed carefully and has no mess to clean up whatsoever. Its thermal performance is excellent, trailing the best pastes on the market by less than 1 degree Celsius.\n\nBest Liquid Metal Thermal Paste\n\nBest Liquid Metal Thermal Paste\n\n(Image credit: Alphacool)\n\n6.

If you\u2019re looking for the best performance on the market, bar none, you\u2019ll want to pick up Eisfrost Extreme.\n\nBest Liquid Metal Thermal Paste (runner-up)\n\nBest Liquid Metal Thermal Paste (Runner-up)\n\n(Image credit: Amazon)\n\n7. BeQuiet DC2 Pro Runner Up: Best Liquid Metal TIM Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Specifications Electrically Conductive: No Thermal Conductivity: 80 W/mk Ease of Use: 1 (1=difficult, 5=simple) Relative Performance: 5 (1=poor, 5=excellent) Cleanup: lint-free absorbent paper towels, alcohol pads or cotton swabs and alcohol Price per gram: Not comparable to traditional pastes Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Check Walmart View at Amazon Reasons to buy + For extreme overclocking + High performance + Relatively inexpensive for a liquid metal paste Reasons to avoid - Difficult to apply - Electrically conductive\n\nBeQuiet\u2019s DC2 Pro is on par with Thermal Grizzly\u2019s Conductonaut overall but is available for much less. As with all liquid metal compounds, extra care will be needed during installation due to electrical conductivity.\n\nThermal Paste Performance Rankings\n\nHere's a breakdown of our recent testing, and we'll be adding new pastes to this list over the coming weeks and months. A bit further down, you'll find our original rounds of testing with 85 different pastes tested in 2017 and 90 pastes tested in 2022, some of which we've revisited in this new performance hierarchy. That should give you a good idea of how other pastes that we haven't retested yet would compare to the newer pastes.\n\nWe'll go into our breakdown of how we test these thermal pastes below, but the key takeaway here is that a single thermal compound can perform differently based on several variables, such as what type of cooler and mount you use. To cover all the bases, we've tested every thermal paste in a traditional air cooling system as well as a liquid cooling system. Below you'll find the temperatures we measured on our standardized test bench, and as always, lower temperatures are better. We've also included value charts in the album below as well.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nThermal Paste Test Results\n\n\u25cf Air Cooling\n\nWe used ID-Cooling\u2019s A720 air cooler for our air cooling setup, as it is one of the best three air coolers we\u2019ve tested thus far.\n\nWe tested a few traditional thermal pads, but thus far, all have failed testing on both air and liquid cooling systems with the power limits that we\u2019ve used for testing. To better demonstrate the performance of these pads, we\u2019ll show a different metric for these types of materials. Our next update will have many more thermal pads tested and will include a new chart to better demonstrate the performance of traditional thermal pads.\n\nLiquid metal compounds top the temperature chart with slightly cooler values than traditional pastes, but not by much. All of the phase change compounds we tested performed only 0.1C behind liquid metals, making them a much more attractive choice due to their lack of electrical conductivity.\n\nWhen we examined the cost of each compound, we were surprised to find that the best traditional paste tested was also very affordable\u2014Toplamp\u2019s TL-A140 was currently available for only $6.99 on Amazon at the time of this publication.\n\nBased on the results from our testing, we\u2019d recommend Toplamp\u2019s TL-A140 for most users. If you want the absolute best thermal performance, don\u2019t bother with the risk of liquid metal for an air cooling setup and use a phase change compound like Honeywell PTM7950 or Thermalright Helios.\n\n\u25cf All In One (AIO) Liquid Cooler\n\nWe used Cooler Master\u2019s Atmos 360 AIO to test thermal compounds on an AIO liquid cooling system.\n\nLiquid metals once again perform best with an AIO but with a larger performance improvement than paste in our air cooling results. However, the performance gained is still rather small compared to traditional compounds. If you want to take full advantage of the performance liquid metal can offer, you\u2019ll need to delid your CPU. However, we don't recommend that for all but the most extreme users who are willing to potentially sacrifice their chip to eke out the last few percentage points of performance \u2014 proceed at your own risk.\n\nJust as with our air cooling results, Toplamp\u2019s AL-140 is the best-performing traditional thermal paste. With its budget price tag of $6.99, it shows that you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money for top-tier performance.\n\nWe tested a few phase change compounds on our liquid cooling setup, and they didn\u2019t perform as well as they did on our air cooling setup. That\u2019s not to say they performed poorly\u2014their performance was on par with good thermal pastes, but with our air cooling results, they performed nearly as well as liquid metal.\n\nThere are a few possibilities to explain why phase change compounds did not perform as well on our liquid cooling system. The most likely of these is the mounting used with Cooler Master\u2019s Atmos 360. I\u2019ll need to test phase change compounds with other liquid coolers to say for sure, and I may investigate this further in the future.\n\n\u25cf Key Takeaways\n\nThermal compounds might always be compared and debated over, but the simple fact remains: PC system building needs thermal compounds to effectively dissipate thermal loads. Without them, our beloved gaming and content-producing machines would struggle to keep components cool during heated frag sessions, heavy workstation computations, or just simply browsing the web.\n\nNot every system will need the most expensive compound, so even the most budget-minded system builders can rest easy knowing that even lower-cost pastes can still prove very effective. For most users, we recommend Toplamp\u2019s AL-140 because it is one of the best pastes we\u2019ve tested and is cheap at only $6.99 USD. You can see our historical testing results with far more pastes after the test setup.\n\nTest System Configuration and Testing Methods\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally CPU Intel i9-14900K Motherboard MSI Z790 Tomahawk Max WiFi Cooling Cooler Master Atmos 360 (AIO Cooling) ID-Cooling A720 (Air Cooling) Chassis XPG Battlecruiser II (Air Cooling) BeQuiet! Dark Base Pro 901 (AIO Cooling) Fan Control PWM at 100%\n\nFor our thermal compound tests, I used the same hardware and configuration for each test to minimize environment variables. Some of these components were sampled by vendors, without whom this testing wouldn\u2019t have been possible. Intel sampled two Raptor Lake i9-14900K CPUs, and MSI sampled two of its latest Z790 Tomahawk Max WiFi motherboards for this testing.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nI\u2019ve tested each thermal paste in two systems, one with an air cooler and one with an AIO liquid cooler. For the air cooling system, I used ID-Cooling\u2019s Frozen A720 Black , which is one of the two best air coolers that I\u2019ve tested on any CPU. For the liquid cooling system, we\u2019ve used Cooler Master\u2019s Atmos 360 AIO . Each system has 32GB (2x 16GB) of DDR5 and MSI\u2019s Z790 Tomahawk Maxi WiFi motherboard.\n\nEach compound is properly burned in before testing, with a burn-in period appropriate to the compound being tested. Most paste applications are burned in with 30 minutes of Cinebench R23 Multi-core testing, split between two 15-minute tests with a cool-down period afterward. There are some exceptions to this rule. With phase change materials like Honeywell\u2019s PTM7950, I ran Cinebench for four 30-minute tests with cool-down periods in between. With Liquid Metal (LM) materials, only a single burn-in test for 15 minutes was needed as LM doesn\u2019t really require a burn-in period at all.\n\nTo test each thermal compound, I ran Cinebench R23\u2019s multi-core stress test for 15 minutes after each compound had been burned in. This is a long enough thermal load that most pastes will reach their maximum temperature by the end of the benchmark. I measured the average temperature of the CPU during testing to demonstrate the effectiveness of a thermal compound.\n\nThe reason the average temperature is used instead of the peak temperature is consistency: I observed more variation with peak temperature results than I was comfortable with, but the average temperature results recorded were very consistent.\n\nExcluding results that were thrown out and retested with a different tube of thermal paste, most results had a variance of no more than 0.2C, with a few having as much as 0.3C. In theory, I\u2019d prefer to reduce that variance to 0.1C or less - but there\u2019s only so much one can do to eliminate variance without having an expensive custom testing lab.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that can impact the performance of a paste. How you apply Thermal Paste and mount your cooler are the two biggest factors, but there can also be variations in the quality of different tubes of the same brand and model of thermal paste. We have retested results to ensure accuracy, but we can\u2019t account for all potential variances in product quality. That said, if testing results from one tube were worse than expected, another tube was obtained.\n\nThe power limits on each system are different and have been chosen to reflect the capabilities of the cooler. For the air cooling system, we used the Intel standard 253W power limit and tested it with an ambient temperature of 22.8 degrees C. With the liquid cooling system, we\u2019ve raised the power limit to 300W and increased the ambient temperature to 23.8 degrees C.\n\nLegacy Thermal Paste Testing - 90 Pastes Tested\n\nHere's our legacy thermal paste testing chart that we generated back in 2022. As you'll notice, many of the same popular pastes in 2022 are still on the market, making it into our new round of 2024 testing.\n\nWe do have new testing equipment for our updated tests, such as a more modern CPU, motherboard, and coolers for our tests - and we use a different stress test. That means these tests are not quite comparable to our legacy results.\n\nWe'll be adding more thermal pastes to our new hierarchy; stay tuned.\n\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)",

Luckily, the settings are highly adjustable via an easy-to-use scroll knob, so you can set the humidifier to a lower level once your desired humidity has been reached.\n\nThe Honeywell is incredibly easy to use; setup took mere minutes. It has a simple, wide removable tank that you fill up and then slip back in. Plug it in, and you're ready to go. The humidifier also alerts you with a refill light when the water levels are low and automatically shuts off when empty. On the lowest settings, it can last a full day on one tank.\n\nThere is an occasional dripping noise that may annoy some. It's quiet enough that you won't hear it over a fan or background music. While it worked well in smaller spaces, you may want to use a fan near it for bigger rooms to help better disperse the vapor stream.\n\nWhile the Honeywell humidifier has an essential oils feature, one pulmonologist recommended against diffusing essential oils if you have respiratory issues. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology also cautions against it.\n\nThe humidifier is easy and quick to clean and doesn't require changing a filter. As a bonus, the sleek look is far more aesthetically pleasing than many other humidifiers on the market, and it can easily fit on most desks, nightstands, and shelves.\n\nThe Vornado UH200 Ultrasonic Humidifier is a close runner-up. It features a larger tank (1.75 gallons versus 1.25), a built-in fan for dispersing water vapor, and warm mist humidification. The Vornado performed similarly to the Honeywell in our humidification tests, but it costs twice as much. Still, it's a solid choice if you require a larger tank design.\n\nBest with air purifier\n\nDyson Purifier Humidify+Cool (PH03) The Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool is a three-in-one smart humidifier, air purifier, and fan that automatically reads and adjusts levels on its own.

But as a three-in-one machine that also functions as an air purifier and a fan, you can make the case that it's more convenient and potentially cheaper to get the Dyson rather than buy those three devices separately.\n\nWhile the Dyson has a smaller footprint than the three machines would separately, it will take up some floor space. That said, for those in the market for the best air-purifying humidifier with smart functions that think for you, the Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool is an excellent choice.\n\nYou connect the Dyson to the MyDyson app (available for iOS and Android) to check your current home humidity and air quality levels. The machine can be controlled with a remote, the app, and via voice control with Alexa and Siri.\n\nThough you can change the humidity and fan levels yourself, you can also set it to auto, and it will decide the best levels for you based on local weather data and your Air Quality Index score. When we used the auto feature, it raised the humidity in a larger open-concept kitchen and living room area to a nice 50% and stayed there.\n\nThe 1-gallon tank also lasts a long time. Dyson claims it lasts for 36 hours even on high settings, and though we didn't time it down to the exact hour, one tank could easily last a few days.\n\nThe fact that it's also a fan makes this a nice year-round option, as it can easily switch between adding extra humidity during winter months to circulating cool air on sticky summer nights. While the fan is very loud on its highest settings, it's nice and quiet on settings of 4 and under, and it does have a night-mode feature that will keep everything automatic but at the quietest levels possible.\n\nAdditionally, for anyone who worries about potential bacteria from humidifiers, the Dyson uses UV light to kill bacteria before expelling the (invisible) water vapor into the air. It alerts you when it needs cleaning and comes with citrus powder packets for that purpose (you can also buy your own). Fill the water tank, add a packet, and hit the self-clean button.\n\nWe haven't needed to change the HEPA filter yet, but be aware those will cost you an additional $80 every 12 months.\n\nWe're currently testing the Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde (PH04). Its design and performance are virtually to the PH03, and it's often cheaper than the PH03, but it also removes formaldehyde from the air.\n\nBest for bedrooms\n\nLevoit Classic 300S Humidifier The Levoit Classic 300S Humidifer clears dry air quickly, quietly, and effectively.

Don't want a nightlight? No problem. You can turn off the display to achieve darkness.\n\nThe Levoit Classic 300S Humidifier did an excellent job of humidifying a 100-square-foot office during testing. On a particularly dry winter day, it steadily increased the office humidity by 11% in four hours. We let it run overnight, and the humidity increased by another 11% by morning.\n\nWhile the button controls on the unit are intuitive, we especially like that you can monitor and adjust the 300S using the VeSync app (available for iOS and Android.) For instance, the app sends a push notification when the tank needs refilling or cleaning. In tests, the humidifier ran on top mist level for 24 hours before needing a refill.\n\nYou can operate the Levoit Classic 300S in manual or auto mode. We preferred manual mode because the built-in hygrometer showed higher readings than the hygrometer we placed on the other side of the room. Thus, it would shut off before areas further from the unit were at the desired humidity level.\n\nCleaning the humidifier was relatively easy using the in-app step-by-step instructions and an included brush.\n\nBest for large rooms\n\nLevoit Superior 6000S Smart Evaporative Humidifier The Levoit Superior 6000S Smart Evaporative Humidifier is the best humidifier for large rooms because of its massive six-gallon tank, app-connectivity, and impressive humidification performance.

It increased the humidity by 36% in our 100-square-foot test room, blowing away the competition. More notably, it increased the humidity in a drafty 1,000-square-foot room by 7%, another best, earning its position as the best humidifier for large rooms.\n\nThe unit maintains precise humidity control within 2% of target levels. While it lacks a remote control, the VeSync app interface provides full functionality. The included fill tube and wheel system address the challenge of filling a six-gallon tank, eliminating the need to lift it during refills. And, even if you run it on high, you only need to refill every two or three days.\n\nThe initial setup process was somewhat cumbersome. Between tank filling, app configuration, and assembly, it took about 20 minutes and wasn't intuitive.\n\nFortunately, maintenance is straightforward, though you must clean the tank with each refill. The humidifier includes a specialized brush for filter maintenance, and its generously sized openings facilitate easy hand cleaning. A convenient \"dry mode\" dries the filter when the unit isn't in use to ensure it lasts longer.\n\nThe Levoit 6000S is louder than most and produces noticeable background noise, operating at 51 decibels on its high setting \u2014 roughly as loud as a quiet office,\n\nDespite the complicated setup process, the Levoit Superior 6000S delivers reliable, powerful humidification with thoughtful design elements that simplify long-term maintenance and operation.\n\nQuietest\n\nLevoit OasisMist 450S Smart Humidifier The Levoit OasisMist 450S Smart Humidifier is a powerful machine with nearly silent operation, which makes it a good fit for larger bedrooms and very light sleepers.

This humidifier remains extremely quiet on all cool mist settings, though it gets slightly louder when producing warm mist.\n\nBeyond being the quietest humidifier, this machine operated efficiently, with no noticeable condensation leakage. Two nozzles rotate 360 degrees so you can aim both mist plumes in any direction. We tested it in a room of roughly 230 square feet, and the humidity shot up by 8% within just one hour. If your room is any smaller than 215 square feet \u2014 the brand's recommended lower range \u2014 this option may end up over-humidifying your space.\n\nIf you like smart features, this humidifier comes well-equipped. It's compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Voice, and you can use VeSync app to control the humidifier's settings, check the humidity in the room, set it to auto mode, or schedule shutoff. The humidifier will also shut down automatically once the tank empties.\n\nThe large tank means this humidifier takes up more space in your room. But that could be a plus since a bigger tank can run longer between refills: After 24 hours of testing on medium and high operation, some water remained in the tank. If you keep the humidifier on low, it can run up to 45 hours. Another bonus of the large tank is a smoother cleaning process. Moreover, the entire top of the tank comes off, making it very easy to scrub.\n\nBest travel\n\nHey Dewy Wireless Facial Humidifier The Hey Dewy Wireless Facial Humidifier is a small but powerful humidifier that may work well in cars, offices, and smaller rooms.

The Hey Dewy humidifier is the best travel humidifier because of its larger 11.3-ounce tank size, powerful mist, and long-lasting charge.\n\nIt didn't pump up the overall room humidity quite as much as the traditional humidifiers we tested, but it still helped add plenty of moisture to the room, especially at close range. After seven hours, it raised the humidity by 6% in a four-foot range and 13% in a two-foot range. So, it may be a good option to set your humidifier on your desk or park it next to your indoor plants.\n\nWhile this humidifier doesn't make much noise, you can hear it running from across the room. When set to the continuous mist option, the sound worked well as gentle white noise \u2014 but the on-off sound of the intermittent spray could be distracting at bedtime.\n\nThe humidifier's filter needs to be replaced at least every six months. However, this may not necessarily be a drawback since the filter means you can use tap water instead of distilled water. The unit comes pre-assembled with the filter in place, and once charged, it will run wirelessly for about eight hours. However, the water may run out before the unit needs recharging. In testing, we found that a full tank of water only lasted about six hours with a continuous mist spray.\n\nThe Hey Dewy humidifier is also available in a plug-in wired version, though we haven't tested it yet.\n\nWhat to look for in a humidifier\n\nConsider important features like room size, filter, and mist temperature when shopping for a humidifier. Here are some more details to guide your shopping.\n\nRoom size: Determine your room's square footage and make note whether the brand recommends the humidifier you're considering for small, medium, or large spaces, and if it is compatible with your room size.\n\n\"If you buy a model that is designed for a larger space, the room will be uncomfortably humid and create an environment that could encourage mold and mildew growth,\" says Sydney Rexroad, communications associate at the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. \"If the model is too small, it won't generate adequate humidity for the space.\"\n\nFilter versus filter-free models: Your choice here may depend on a few factors since one isn't necessarily better. \"Filtered humidifiers are evaporative and use a fan to humidify the air. Filter-free models will put a mist directly into the air,\" Rexroad says. Additionally, filter-free models have a higher risk of bacteria or allergens getting into the air, so be sure you can clean it thoroughly at least once a week. On the other hand, filters need to be replaced, which adds cost you may not want to take on. Filter models are often noisier, too.\n\nCold mist versus warm mist: According to all three experts we spoke with, this is entirely based on personal preference. Depending on your main use for the humidifier, you may want to consult your healthcare provider before making a choice.\n\nSmall versus large humidifiers: Generally speaking, larger humidifiers have bigger tanks, meaning they can run longer between refills. Smaller humidifiers are easier to move throughout your house or take with you when you travel, but some may not last an entire day or night when set to high. That said, if the room you want to humidify is on the smaller side, a larger humidifier may add too much moisture to the air. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor humidity should never rise about 60%. This is because too-high humidity can lead to mold growth. You can check the humidity in your room with a hygrometer.\n\nAdditional features: A common humidifier feature is essential oil diffusion, but we warn against using this. If you do so, pick a model explicitly for that dual purpose. For example, some humidifiers have essential oil trays beneath the tank where you can add a drop or two of your chosen oil. Never put the oil directly into the machine. \"Essential oils, medications, or other substances can damage the humidifier's mechanical parts,\" Rexroad says.\n\nHow we test humidifiers\n\nWe use a sound meter (in the foreground) to measure the loudness of each humidifier and hygrometers (on the nightstand) to measure the humidity next to each unit and on the other side of the room. James Brains/Business Insider\n\nWe tested 21 popular humidifiers for this guide. What you need from a humidifier will depend on the size of your space, how frequently you want to use it, and your main goal for humidifying. However, some universal factors make for a good humidifier. Here's what we looked for while testing and choosing our top picks:\n\nHumidity increase: This is the most obvious and most important factor. If a humidifier doesn't raise the humidity levels of your space to the EPA-recommended 30% to 50%, it doesn't serve its main function. We used a hygrometer to definitively test the humidity levels of our space before, during, and after using each humidifier. We tested the levels right near the humidifiers and across rooms of various sizes.\n\nEase of setup and use: If a humidifier is hard to figure out, a pain to fill up, or doesn't last a full day or night on one tank, chances are you won't want to use it very often. Most of our picks take five minutes or less to set up, are easy to fill, and last at least 10 hours on one tank. Some can even last days on a single tank.\n\nEase of cleaning: Without proper cleaning, humidifiers can grow mold or bacteria that can then be dispersed into your home. We deep-cleaned every humidifier we chose and found it to be easy for all of our recommendations.\n\nExtra features: Some humidifiers come with fancy extras that range from simple night-light settings to app and voice control. These extras were considered to discern if they provided additional value and ease of use.\n\nLongevity: We've tested most of these humidifiers for about two months and have not encountered issues with the top choices. We will continue to test to ensure they hold up over time and no serious problems arise, such as mold growth.\n\nHumidifier FAQs\n\nAre humidifiers good for the lungs?\n\nDr. Purvi Parikh, an adult and pediatric allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network, said dry air can worsen allergy and asthma symptoms. Introducing a humidifier will moisten the air, which may help protect your lungs from irritants. However, keeping the humidifier clean is essential to prevent mold and bacteria buildup. Additionally, only use distilled water in your humidifier unless the device specifically says to use tap water. Tap water can release minerals into the air, and experts don't yet know the long-term health effects of breathing in these particles.\n\nIs a cool mist or warm mist humidifier better?\n\nWarm and cool mist humidifiers work equally well to add moisture to the air, so Rexroad and Parikh suggest letting your personal preferences guide you in this decision. If a doctor or other healthcare professional recommends using a humidifier, check with them to find out if a cool mist or warm mist would help you get the most relief. You may also prefer a warm mist humidifier during the colder months. Remember that the Mayo Clinic warns against using warm-mist humidifiers around babies and children since they pose a risk of burns.\n\nWhat is the most effective type of humidifier?\n\nAn effective humidifier should raise the humidity in a room without over-humidifying. Our picks raised room humidity by at least 6% over eight hours. However, since experts recommend keeping the humidity level in your home between 30% and 50%, the most effective humidifier for you will help maintain this humidity level. If you'd like to use your humidifier to help ease congestion, dry skin, and other symptoms, a healthcare professional can provide more guidance on choosing a humidifier for your specific needs.\n\nWhich humidifiers are best for winter?\n\nAccording to Christine Kingsley, APRN, the health and wellness director of the Lung Institute, using a humidifier during the winter can be helpful because indoor heating can dry out the air. \"Humidifiers add moisture to the air, alleviating symptoms of dry skin, dry throat, and sinus congestion,\" Kingsley said.\n\nSome people prefer warm-mist humidifiers during the colder months. These humidifiers disperse vapor by heating water, adding warmth to chilly rooms. But Kingsley cautioned that warm mist can create an extremely humid environment, which could lead to mold and bacteria growth.\n\nDo I need an air purifier and humidifier?\n\nAn air purifier removes pollutants, helping reduce potentially irritating particles like dust, pollen, and pet dander, said John Landry, licensed registered respiratory therapist and founder of Respiratory Therapy Zone. On the other hand, Landry said a humidifier adds moisture to the air, which can help soothe dry skin, sinus congestion, and respiratory issues. You may benefit from an air purifier if you have seasonal allergies or asthma, while a humidifier may offer relief if you live in a drier climate or have dry skin.\n\nWhich humidifiers are safe for children and babies?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics considers cool mist humidifiers the safest option for babies and young children. Warm mist humidifiers work by producing steam, which can be hot enough to burn a curious toddler who tries to touch it. Whichever type of humidifier you choose, always set it somewhere out of reach of children and pets. Another important part of humidifier safety is only using distilled water, which is free of minerals that may evaporate into your household air, and cleaning the unit regularly with vinegar.\n\nHow often do you need to clean a humidifier?\n\nThe EPA advises cleaning your humidifier every third day with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. You can also clean your humidifier with vinegar. To clean your humidifier properly, unplug the unit and then use a scrubbing brush to clean all surfaces that touch water. If you use any chemicals to clean your humidifier, rinse it with clean tap water several times before using it again. You can check the instruction booklet that came with your humidifier for additional cleaning instructions specific to your unit. If you don't intend to use your humidifier for a while, it's a good idea to clean it out and allow it to fully dry before you store it.",

            "content": "If you are looking to cut heating bills in this cool weather, there are options beyond adding a warm sweater and socks. Keeping your thermostat set to this exact temperature consistently should help and so should adding a space heater, which could tame your heating bill even further.\n\nWhether you use oil, gas, electric or propane to heat your home during winter months, energy costs are one of the biggest expenses for any household. In fact, a recent CNET survey found that 78% of Americans said high energy bills are a source of financial stress.\n\nUsing a space heater in the rooms your occupy most and leaving the thermostat even lower for a portion of the day can trim hundreds off of your yearly spend. This is a particularly viable practice for those who spend a chunk of the day in their home office or spend evenings in an enclosed living room leaving the rest of the house mostly unoccupied.\n\nSo how much can you save with a space heater? To find out, we did the math. While there are variables, including regional energy prices, energy type used to heat your home, local climate and home size, we relied on broad national averages to find an answer. It turns out you can save hundreds of dollars -- up to $500 if you're heating a large home with pricey oil.\n\nWith energy costs high, we explore space heaters as a money-saving mechanism. CNET\n\nFor more ways to save money this winter, check out five tips to save money on your heating bill, where you should move your thermostat to cut down heating costs and the best energy-saving smart gadgets that will help you cut down your bills.\n\nHow much does a space heater cost to run?\n\nThe cost to run a space heater depends on the type of heater that you've got, including its size and wattage. A small personal heater can be purchased as cheaply as $20, whereas a full-room heater can run you up to $300, depending on the model and heating capacity. Larger heaters cover more area and are more effective (while smaller heaters in big spaces are inefficient), but also cost more to run.\n\nYou'll want to consider energy efficiency. This is tricky when it comes to space heaters because they are not currently evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency's EnergyStar program. As a result, you'll have to take the word of the manufacturer.\n\nFinally, you'll need to take into account your state or municipality's electricity rates. This will determine the cost per hour that you can expect to incur by running your space heater. These prices might also dictate how long you'd like to run your space heater.\n\nOn average, you can expect to pay about 20 cents per hour to run a typical space heater that's 1,500 watts and can heat a standard room such as a home office or bedroom. If you run it for eight hours per day, you'll pay about $1.60 per day or $48 per month.\n\nHow much does it cost to heat the average home?\n\nHeating costs in the US can push $2,000 for a single season. Saklakova/Getty Images\n\nComparatively, the cost to heat a house varies widely, based largely on home size and fuel type. Below is what the US ffederalEnergy Information Association predicted US households will spend on heating from Oct. 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025 (181 days). The chart of anticipated costs for various fuel types to heat a home in a climate 10% colder than the national average for winter 2024-25.\n\nProjected US heating costs for winter 2024-25\n\nAverage cost per season (Oct. '24 - March '25) Average price per day Average price per hour Natural gas $637 $3.52 $0.15 Heating oil $1,564 $8.64 $0.36 Electricity $1,095 $6.04 $0.25 Propane $1,345 $7.43 $0.31\n\nCan a space heater really lower your energy bill?\n\nThis chimney-style space heater adds warmth and ambiance. ChimneyFree\n\nWhile $50 per month sounds like a steal for heating, a space heater is not a full substitute for heating an entire home. But there are plenty of ways to save money using a space heater to supplement your heat and lower your utility bill.\n\nHome heating isn't particularly efficient since you're rarely if ever occupying all rooms. A natural foil for a bloated heating bill is to crank down the thermostat and use a space heater to warm a room you know you'll be in for an extended period, such as your home office during the day or living room in the evening.\n\nFor this exercise, I'll calculate how much you could save using a space heater for a third of the day or eight hours.\n\nUsing the figures in the first chart, I've calculated the average cost of running a space heater for eight hours versus the cost of running the heat for the entire home using each of the four most popular fuel types. Then I multiplied the cost of each eight-hour total by 181 days (Oct. 1 to Mar. 31).\n\nFrom that, we get a snapshot of the cost difference between running a space heater vs. centralized heat, along with potential savings for using a space heater for a portion of the day.\n\nSavings using a space heater for 8 hours per day\n\nCost per 8 hours Savings using space heater, 8 hours Savings with space heater, Oct.-March Natural gas $1.20 -$0.20 -$36.20 Heating oil $2.88 $1.28 $231.68 Electricity $2 $0.40 $72.40 Propane $2.48 $0.88 $159.28\n\nFor those using oil or propane as fuel, the savings are significant: $159 for propane and $231.68 for oil through the winter season alone. Those with electric heat save less -- about $72 respectively -- and folks with natural gas, which is currently cheap, would pay about $36 more than if they ran a space heater.\n\nBut these numbers don't tell the entire story.\n\nPeople with larger homes will save more\n\nOne big caveat to these numbers for estimated heating costs is that they account for all homes and home types in the US, including smaller apartments and condos. According to Realtor.com, the average square footage of all homes in the US is about 1,800.\n\nTo heat an average freestanding home with oil, for instance, with a 75,000-BTU furnace, you're probably looking at a number closer to 50 cents an hour, according to PickHvac's heating cost calculator. And this is a yearly average; zeroing in on the winter season would only boost that hourly cost more.\n\nThe larger your home, the more it costs to heat and the greater your savings will be if you use a space heater. If your home is twice the size of the average US home, for instance, your savings would likely double if you swapped a space heater in for eight hours. For homes that rely on heating oil, that could amount to savings of more than $500 over the course of a winter.\n\nHouseholds in colder climates will also save more, on average\n\nKeeping the thermostat set at or below 68 degrees in the winter is another way to trim costs from your energy bill. Tyler Lizenby/CNET\n\nThe figures provided by the Energy Information Association are based on climates just 10% colder than the national average. The EIA numbers represent something of a rough estimate of US heating costs, but ask anyone in North Dakota, upstate New York or Vermont, and they'll tell you these numbers are decidedly low. Anecdotally, we spoke with Deb Barber from Wakefield, Rhode Island. Barber uses oil to heat a 2,000-square-foot home and reported monthly winter heating bills regularly over $400.\n\nRead more: This New Smart Thermostat That Helps Me Sleep Better Is $50 Off Right Now\n\nIf we use a low estimate of 50 cents per hour for heating a freestanding home of about 2,000 square feet with oil during the winter months in a colder climate, the savings for using a space heater for eight hours in place of central heat would jump to over $400 for the season. Swap in more expensive oil, electricity or propane and prorate for the same scenario above (a larger home or apartment and colder climate) and you're talking about potential savings well into the thousands.\n\nIf you're looking to add a space heater to cut energy costs, we've done some digging to find the best space heaters for 2025, including a budget pick, compact models and the best space heater for large rooms.\n\nHow do costs vary based on space heater settings?\n\nThe cost to run a space heater varies depending on its size and power. Honeywell\n\nOn most space heaters, you'll see an option to adjust the level of heat that the appliance provides. Most have some form of a \"low,\" \"medium\" and \"high\" setting. Typically, what these settings translate to is the amount of the wattage capacity used to heat your room.\n\nLet's say you have a space heater that can produce up to 1,500 watts and you place it on the \"low\" setting, it may only use 750 watts of its capacity. This has an impact on the overall energy consumption that your space heater will require. It can cut the daily cost in half. However, it may limit the heating ability of the space heater. It might be best to use the low setting to maintain warmth and only use the medium or high settings to provide additional heat to save on cost.\n\nSpace heaters are handy appliances to have, especially as the weather outside gets frightful and you need to start layering your clothes. But you'll want to prepare yourself for the cost of using a space heater. An additional $50 per month of utility costs can significantly impact your budget if you aren't prepared for it. Consider how to best balance your budget and your heating needs to make it through the winter in comfort and without breaking the bank.\n\nHow to pick the right space heater\n\nMost indoor space heaters are powered by electricity. Ambient Edge\n\nIf you're looking for some extra heat in the winter or to warm up your cubicle in a particularly cold office building, a space heater can be an excellent option. But not all space heaters are made the same. You'll want to take into account the amount of space that you're trying to heat, the way they heat the space and the amount of energy they consume.\n\nRead more: 78% of Americans Are Stressed Out About High Energy Bills\n\nFor most people, a standard space heater that covers an average room will do the job. These cover about 200 square feet and are usually around 1,500 watts. If you're looking to heat under a desk or a smaller space, a personal space heater with about 400 or 500 watts will do the job.\n\nTwo mains space heater types to consider\n\nUse care and caution when operating space heaters. Hector Roqueta Rivero/Getty Images\n\nMost space heaters fall into one of two types when it comes to generating heat. There are convection heaters, which work by heating coils that help to heat the air and spread it through the room with a fan. Then there are radiant heaters, which emit infrared radiation to help heat an area.\n\nRadiant heaters are faster but more focused, whereas a convection heater provides more even heat throughout an area. In small bursts, radiant heaters are more efficient -- but in a space that needs to be heated for an extended period, convection can prove to be more effective.\n\nWhichever space heater you choose, make sure to check out our space heater safety guide.\n\nIf your utility relies on a time-of-use plan, learn more about peak and off-peak hours to save money.

According to a report by Reuters, the company's inability to secure additional funding to sustain day-to-day operations prompted this decisive move.\n\nDespite financial backing from industry giants like Mercedes-Benz and Honeywell, Volocopter has struggled to navigate the capital-heavy demands of bringing its flagship urban air taxi, VoloCity, to market. As companies across the eVTOL arena gear up for commercial operations, the financial strain is evident. The recent challenges faced by Volocopter mirror the broader financial pressures in the sector, as highlighted by industry data from IndexBox, which indicates a slowing growth rate and increased competition for funding.\n\nVolocopter, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Bruchsal, Germany, was expected to launch VoloCity by 2025. However, the current financial predicament casts uncertainty over its future. As it stands, Volocopter intends to continue operations during insolvency proceedings, exploring potential avenues for new investment.\n\nThe company's predicament is not isolated. In November, another eVTOL firm, Lilium, revealed it would soon file for insolvency after encountering similar financial challenges. The ongoing strain across the industry underscores the intrinsic difficulties companies face in raising sufficient capital to advance revolutionary urban air mobility solutions.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Strong performances by tier-one lenders Zenith Bank and United Bank for Africa (UBA) provided a boost to the Nigerian stock market last week, helping offset losses in other sectors and mitigating a broader market decline. The resilience of these banking giants contributed to a positive close for the domestic bourse during the holiday-shortened trading week.\n\nThe All-Share Index (ASI) gained 0.99 percent, closing at 102,133.30 points by the end of the week. Gains recorded in MTNN (10.54 percent week-on-week), Zenith Bank (0.22 percent w/w), and UBA (2.37 percent w/w) counterbalanced declines in ARADEL (-9.64 percent w/w) and OANDO (-3.09 percent w/w). Consequently, the year-to-date (YTD) return improved to 36.59 percent, while the market capitalization rose by ?608.74 billion, closing the week at ?61.91 trillion.\n\nDespite the week\u2019s overall positive performance, the day\u2019s trading session saw a marginal dip as the ASI fell by 5 basis points (bps). Declines in GTCO (-1.64 percent), UBA (-4.03 percent), and ACCESSCORP (-2.83 percent) outweighed gains recorded by FBN Holdings (0.72 percent), OANDO (2.36 percent), and Stanbic IBTC (1.69 percent), leading to a subdued market close.\n\nMarket activity showed a decline in turnover, with the value of transactions falling by 4.24 percent compared to the previous session. A total of 451.73 million shares, valued at ?17.49 billion, were traded in 12,551 deals. UBA (-4.03 percent) led the volume chart with 41.73 million shares exchanged, while SEPLAT accounted for the highest value of transactions, recording deals worth ?3.01 billion.\n\nThe market breadth closed on a positive note, with a ratio of 2.41 advancing stocks to every declining stock. Universal Procurement Logistics (UPL) topped the gainers\u2019 list with a 10.00 percent increase, leading 40 other advancing equities. On the flip side, Honeywell Flour Mills (HONYFLOUR) led the laggards with a 9.09 percent loss, followed by 16 other decliners.\n\nThe banking sector remained a key driver of the market\u2019s resilience, with Zenith Bank and UBA maintaining investor confidence despite mixed performance across other sectors. MTNN also contributed significantly to the week\u2019s gains, bolstering the telecoms sector. However, weaknesses in the oil and gas sector, highlighted by declines in ARADEL and OANDO, partially eroded the gains.\n\nMarket analysts suggest that the Nigerian equities market could see more mixed performances in the coming weeks, as investors continue to weigh economic uncertainties and sector-specific fundamentals. While the robust gains in key banking stocks and telecoms provide optimism, pressures in the oil and gas sector and sporadic sell-offs could influence overall market direction.\n\nWith the year-to-date return at an impressive 36.59 percent, the Nigerian stock market remains a key focus for investors. However, sustained momentum will depend on positive corporate earnings, stability in macroeconomic indicators, and improved investor sentiment across all sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: Equities market dips by 0.3% as sell-offs wipes out N148.2bn",
