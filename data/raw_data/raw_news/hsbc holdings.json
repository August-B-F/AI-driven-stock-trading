I say no!\n\nMarket upheavals can offer some of the best times to snap up shares in high-quality companies at bargain prices. And we\u2019re having one now, with the FTSE 100 down 120 points at the time of writing on 3 April in response to President Trump\u2019s global trade upheaval.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that we won\u2019t really know the real effect of the Trump tariffs until well after he\u2019s out of office. And that reminds me of when Margaret Thatcher famously exclaimed that \u201cif you try to buck the market, the market will buck you.\u201d\n\nWhat crisis?\n\nIt was back in 1992 and she was specifically talking about\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t really matter. We\u2019ve long forgotten about whatever was shaking up politicians back then. Markets shrugged it off and have kept on doing what markets do.\n\nIn the case of stock markets, that\u2019s climbing. The FTSE 100 is worth three-and-a-half times what it was then. And we\u2019ve had 33 years of dividends on top.\n\nThe same will surely be true of Donald Trump and his tariffs. If they work, great. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll surely be discarded and markets will move on. Upwards if history means anything.\n\nCheaper today\n\nHSBC Holdings (LSE: HSBA) has long been a favourite for passive income. When the London Stock Exchange closed on 2 April, hours ahead of tariff showtime, HSBC was on a forecast dividend yield of 5.8%. With the share price down 6% at the time of writing, that\u2019s now up to 6.1%.\n\nIt suggests the new trade environment will adversely affect the bank\u2019s ability to pay its dividends. But I\u2019m finding it hard to see how US import levies can do much lasting harm to a multinational banking giant. Especially one focused mainly on the Chinese economic sphere.\n\nBut then, UK-listed banks in general are down. Barclays has fallen 5.5%. Even the wholly UK-focused Lloyds Banking Group has lost 2.4%. When big investors are spooked for whatever reason, they sell bank stocks.\n\nDan Coatsworth at AJ Bell said \u201cit seems as if fewer investors want to own banks despite many paying generous dividends which can provide comfort during rocky market conditions.\u201d\n\nDividend outlook\n\nWhen HSBC posted 2024 full-year results in February, there was enough cash for a \u00a32bn share buyback. That was on top of lifting the full-year dividend by 43%. The bank said it intends to keep its dividend payout ratio at 50%. And with forecasters predicting a 24% rise in earnings per share (EPS) between 2024 and 2027, I\u2019d say the passive income prospects look good.\n\nThere\u2019s still a risk that banks will suffer from some of the tariff fallout. In fact, I think that\u2019s probably almost certain.",

            "content": "In the next 10-15 years \u2013 or possibly sooner \u2013 quantum computers will be capable of breaking the encryption standards underpinning our digital world.\n\nCurrent encryption methods like Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman (RSA) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) will become obsolete.\n\nThis means that new quantum-safe encryption standards, such as those from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, must be adopted as soon as possible.\n\nFor sectors such as banking, energy and healthcare \u2013 where sensitive information is critical \u2013 ignoring the quantum threat could lead to disastrous consequences.\n\nWhile there\u2019s debate around exactly when a reliable quantum computer of sufficient size will be able to break some of the most widely used cryptosystems, the time to build defences is now - we cannot take any chances.\n\nWhatever you might believe about quantum tech and timescales, preparing now is prudent risk management.\n\nComplex process\n\nThere\u2019s a 19-34% chance that cryptography might be broken in the next 10 years and there\u2019s a roll-of-the-dice chance that might happen in the next 5 years, according to the Quantum Threat Timeline Report.\n\nOne of the main reasons why organisations should start preparing now is that transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is a complex, multi-year process.\n\nIt takes time to identify vulnerable systems and data, to integrate quantum-safe solutions such as post-quantum cryptography, ensure cryptographic agility, and to explore and potentially implement other quantum-safe technologies like quantum key distribution.\n\nLarge global organisations such as HSBC also need to comply with regulations and cryptographic standards in all of the geographies in which they operate.\n\nCyber threat\n\nAnother reason to build quantum defences now is the phenomenon known as harvest now, decrypt later.\n\nAccording to the G7 Cyber Expert Group, encrypted data that is transmitted or stored today could be harvested and decrypted by quantum attackers in the future.\n\nData with a long shelf life - that is, data that is still relevant in say five to 10 years\u2019 time - must be protected as a priority against retrospective decryption.\n\nTaking action\n\nAt HSBC, we believe it\u2019s crucial to stay one step ahead.\n\nWe were the first bank to join BT and Toshiba\u2019s quantum-secured metro network, to pioneer quantum protection for AI-powered foreign exchange trading and to trial the application of quantum-secure technology for buying and selling tokenised physical gold.\n\nOur efforts are global. We\u2019re also collaborating with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other banks on quantum security.\n\nThese are just some of the reasons why we secured the number two spot in two new global indexes tracking the adoption of quantum technology in the finance sector.\n\nWe\u2019re embracing this technology and preparing, in a safe and secure way, for the future quantum economy. We want to encourage others do the same.",

            "content": "There has been a fair bit of discussion about the HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA) in the Beansprout telegram community recently.\n\nAfter all, the HSBC EGA is currently offering a promotional interest rate of up to 3.85% p.a. on your savings.\n\nThis would make it one of the best savings accounts in Singapore, after many banks cut their interest rates in recent months.\n\nThere were many questions about the requirements to earn the interest rate of 3.85% p.a., and if there is any catch to the promotion.\n\nLet us break down what is the interest rate on the HSBC EGA, and how you can qualify for the higher interest rates.\n\nWhat is HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA)?\n\nThe HSBC EGA is a multi-currency savings account where you can perform foreign currency transactions with it.\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nWhat is the interest rate on the HSBC EGA?\n\nThe HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA) offers a prevailing interest rate of 0.05% p.a.\n\n\n\nIf you sign up by 30 April 2025, you will earn a bonus interest rate of up to 2.80% p.a. in April, May and June on your top-up amount, up til a maximum of S$5 million.\n\nThis means that you can earn an interest rate of up to 2.85% p.a. with the HSBC EGA.\n\nThe requirement is that you would need to have a wealth holding with HSBC to earn this bonus interest.\n\nIf you do not have wealth holdings with HSBC, you will earn a bonus interest rate of 2.70% p.a., which will bring the total interest rate on incremental deposits to 2.75% p.a.\n\nEligible wealth products are all wealth products with the exclusion of Foreign Exchange (FX) and Dual Currency Plus.\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nFor those of us who are looking at the interest rate of up to 2.85% p.a, you might be wondering if you have to do anything else to earn the bonus interest rate? The answer is no.\n\nYou must be thinking, wow this is too good to be true. Yes, you are right. This 2.90% p.a. looks decent BUT the bonus interest will only be paid for the months of April, May, and June 2025.\n\nAfter that, the interest you would earn on the HSBC EGA could revert back to 0.05% p.a., as the bonus interest rate is subject to change.\n\nIt might be worth noting that the top-up amount is compared against the reference month of March 2025.\n\nFor example, if you have an average daily balance (ADB) of S$200,000 in April 2025 and ADB of S$10,000 in March 2025, the top-up amount will be S$190,000.\n\nThe bonus interest will only be paid out by 31 August 2025, after all the conditions are met.\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nHow to earn an additional \u20181% bonus interest rate\u2019 on the HSBC EGA Account\n\nYou might be wondering, 2.85% p.a. is nowhere near the advertised interest rate of up to 3.85% p.a. Where is the 1% p.a.?\n\nAside from the 2.85% p.a. bonus interest rate, the EGA is also paying \u2018additional 1% bonus interest rate\u2019 on the incremental SGD average daily balances under the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme.\n\nTo differentiate from the bonus interest rate above, we shall call this the \u2018additional 1% bonus interest rate\u2019 in this article.\n\nTo qualify, you would need to perform the following:\n\nMake at least 5 eligible transactions with your EGA, such as GIRO bill payments, fund transfers and/or using your Everyday Global Debit Card or any HSBC Credit Card. Note that eligible Transactions excludes funds transfers between HSBC accounts with the same account holder name.\n\nDeposit an aggregate of at least S$2,000 into an Eligible Account in a given calendar month via salary crediting and/or inward transfers from a non-HSBC bank account\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nHere, I want to stress and highlight that this 'additional 1% bonus interest rate\u2019 paid is on the incremental SGD average daily balance.\n\nYou will earn the 'additional 1% bonus interest rate\u2019 on your top-up amount for each calendar month when you meet the criteria above.\n\nNote that the top-up amount here is the increase in average deposit balance due to fresh funds compared to the previous month.\n\nFor those who are wondering, \u2018fresh funds\u2019 means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account. Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s), cashier\u2019s order(s) or demand draft(s) are not permitted.\n\nThere is a max cap of S$300 to be earned per calendar month for this \u2018additional 1% bonus interest\u2019.\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nOnce again, do take note that the criteria differs for HSBC Premier and Personal Banking Customers. The criteria shown above is meant for Personal Banking Customers only.\n\nPremier customers would need to deposit at least S$5,000 and make a minimum of 5 transactions.\n\nEarn cashback through the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme\n\nYou can earn a cashback of 1% on eligible card spend on HSBC Everyday Global Debit Card and GIRO bill payments.\n\nDo note that there are exclusions to the above e.g. your usual insurance, utilities, educational institutions payments. You can refer to the T&C link for the full list.\n\nHere, I want to point out that there is also a cap on the cashback you are getting.\n\nIt is S$300 per calendar month for HSBC Personal Banking customers and S$500 for Premier customers.\n\nSource: HSBC\n\nOne-time bonus cash reward for new HSBC Everyday+ Rewards programme customers\n\nFor the \u201cnewbies\u201d, you stand to earn a one-time bonus cash reward of S$150 when you sign up for a new account.\n\nNote that there is a catch here. You will need to maintain a deposit of S$100,000 for the first six consecutive month for Personal Banking clients, before the cash reward is paid on the 7th month.\n\nThe minimum deposit required for this cash reward is higher at S$200,000 for Premier banking clients, but customers who are eligible will receive S$300 as a welcome reward.\n\nWhile the one-time bonus cash reward is only paid out if the minimum deposit is maintained for six month, this one-time bonus cash reward SHOULD NOT be the reason why you sign up for this account.\n\nWhat else do I need to do to be eligible for the HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA) promotion?\n\nTo be eligible for the HSBC EGA promotion, both new and existing HSBC customers must successfully register by sending an SMS with the relevant info in the following format to 74722 within the promotional period:\n\nEGA <space> First 9-digit of their Everyday Global Account number (e.g. EGA 123456789)\n\nFinal verdict on the HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA)\n\nOverall, the HSBC EGA allows us to earn a pretty impressive interest rate of up to 3.85% p.a. if you have a wealth holding with HSBC.\n\nEven without a wealth product, the interest rate of up to 3.75% p.a. is still higher than the interest rate for most other savings accounts currently.\n\nHowever, the catch is that the bonus interest rate will only be paid for the months of April, May and June 2025.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the \u2018additional 1% bonus interest\u2019 only applies to fresh funds for each month.\n\nHence, the HSBC EGA account may be more suited for individuals who are looking for an additional savings account beyond the one used for salary credit to earn a higher interest rate for a few months.\n\nAs there are numerous conditions that come with each of the bonus rewards, it is recommended that you go through the terms and conditions here and here carefully.\n\nThis is especially so given that the bonus interest rate will only be paid in August 2025, so you may not be able to find out if you have missed out on some eligibility criteria in the meantime.\n\nTo find out which savings account allows your money to work harder, check out our guide to the best savings account with highest interest rates in Singapore\n\nJoin Beansprout's Telegram group to get the latest insights on savings, investing and retirement planning.",

That is demonstrated by the strong financial performance of the Group in 2024,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSecond, this performance has allowed us to reward you, our valued shareholders, with increased returns.\n\n\u201dAnd third, looking ahead, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong performance and returns and stand behind a strong dividend outlook.\u201d\n\nSir Mark thanked the shareholders for their \u201ccontinued, strong and loyal support over the last 12 months\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is greatly appreciated and highly valued by us all.\u201d\n\nOn stage alongside Sir Mark were Group CEO Georges Elhedery; Peter Wong, Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; David Liao, our Co-CEO, Asia and Middle East; and Luanne Lim, HSBC Hong Kong Chief Executive.\n\nWhat else was said at the meeting\n\nSir Mark reflected on the bank\u2019s 160th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\u201cIt has been wonderful to see our 160th anniversary celebrated across Hong Kong, including at our HSBC Global Investment Summit last week and at the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens over the weekend \u2013 both of which showcased the best of Hong Kong to the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs Hong Kong\u2019s global bank, we will continue to do all we can to ensure that this great city leads on the international stage.\u201d\n\nOur Annual General Meeting The when, where and how to vote of our AGM. Find out more\n\nTurning to our 2024 financial performance, Sir Mark said: \u201c2024 was a very good year for HSBC.\n\n\u201cWe delivered record profit before tax of US$32.3 billion \u2013 an increase of US$2.0bn compared with 2023.\n\n\u201cOur reported return on tangible equity was 14.6 per cent, or 16 per cent excluding material notable items \u2013 in line with our mid-teens target.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis strong financial performance enabled us to reward you, our loyal shareholders, with higher returns.\n\n\u201cIn total, we returned US$26.9 billion to shareholders in respect of 2024.\n\n\u201cThe total dividend announced for 2024 was 87 US cents per share, which amounts to US$15.9 billion.\n\n\u201cThis includes the special dividend of 21 US cents per share, totalling US$3.9 billion, paid in June following the completion of the sale of HSBC Bank Canada.\n\n\u201cExcluding this special dividend, the full-year dividend of 66 US cents per share was higher than that of 2023.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we announced four share buybacks in respect of 2024 worth a total of up to US$11 billion.\u201d\n\nSir Mark continued: \u201cSince the start of 2023, we have repurchased 11 per cent of the issued share count.\n\n\u201cCombined with our sustained levels of profitability, this led to greater earnings and dividends per share for our shareholders.\n\n\u201cDividends paid in 2024, together with a more than 20 per cent increase in the share price, delivered a total shareholder return for the year of more than 30 per cent.\u201d\n\nGeorges Elhedery, Group CEO\n\nGeorges reflected on his first seven months as Group CEO, saying: \u201cThe opportunity to lead HSBC is a privilege.\n\n\u201cLike each of my predecessors, I see my responsibility as being to deliver sustainable, strategic growth for you, our loyal shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe begin from a position of strength, which is reinforced by our 2024 performance, as Mark has described.\u201d\n\nHe also reflected on the reorganisation of the bank, which became effective on 1 January, to simplify our structure and align it to our strategy.\n\nGeorges added: \u201cI am confident about our future and what we can achieve. As we celebrate our 160th anniversary, our history and heritage stand us in good stead.\n\n\u201cIn so many ways, adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done.\n\n\u201cIt brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted adviser to our customers as they navigate the world\u2019s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe actions we are taking will have clear and tangible impact.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to unlock HSBC\u2019s full potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders, provide excellent customer outcomes that enhance our franchise and brand, and generate the strategic growth that will deliver attractive returns for you, our loyal shareholders.\u201d\n\nPeter Wong, Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\n\n\u201cIn 1865, HSBC was established in Hong Kong. It was created to assist businesses with trade finance and meet the needs of the real economy,\u201d said Peter, who spoke in Cantonese.\n\n\u201cIn this 160 years of history, whether the economic environment has been good or bad, we have focused on business development and bringing good returns to our shareholders.\u201d\n\nPeter spoke about the importance of Hong Kong to HSBC and how we\u2019re helping to enhance Hong Kong\u2019s status as an international city.\n\nHe reflected on the ways in which we support small businesses and personal customers, and the work we\u2019re doing to promote the development of financial markets and asset tokenisation.\n\nHe also highlighted our ongoing support for the community through the Hongkong Bank Foundation, which has donated more than HK$2.6 billion (US$335 million), in \u201ccaring for the elderly, nurturing the young people and the three aspects of promoting sustainable development\u201d.\n\n\u201cA total of more than 10,000 projects have been supported and more than seven million people have benefited,\u201d Peter said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, our colleagues actively participate in volunteer service. Over the years, the aggregate service hours of the HSBC volunteers have reached nearly 1.1 million hours.\u201d",

In past years, some shareholders voiced discontent about the bank\u2019s dividend payment and urged management to spin-off the Asia business.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to do all we can to ensure that this great city leads on the international stage,\u201d said Mark Tucker, HSBC\u2019s group chairman.\n\nHe told shareholders that the bank had reported a strong pre-tax profit of US$32.4 billion for the year, while maintaining a dividend payout ratio of 50 per cent. This helped the bank to return US$26.9 billion to investors via dividends and share repurchases, he said.\n\n\u201cSince the start of 2023, we have repurchased 11 per cent of the issued share capital\u201d, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTucker also said HSBC would continue to invest in Asia, with a particular focus on Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n\u201cHong Kong, our spiritual home, remains our most profitable market,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cThe real opportunity for China [is the continued] opening up of its markets. As part of this, Hong Kong \u2013 as the superconnector between China, Asia and the rest of the world \u2013 has a very important role to play.\u201d",

            "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: HSBC (HSBC)\n\nHeadquartered in London, HSBC Holdings plc is a major global banking and financial services firm with $3.02 trillion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. Operating through a global network of various offices in nearly 60 countries and regions in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and North and Latin America, it provides a wide range of financial services.\n\nHSBC is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 8.4; value investors should take notice.\n\nTwo analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.23 to $6.83 per share. HSBC boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.8%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, HSBC should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC)?\n\nBefore you invest in HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

HOOD is transforming its business model by launching an integrated suite of financial services intended to attract retail investors looking for private banking and wealth management solutions. This was reported first by Reuters.\n\nDetails of Robinhood\u2019s Planned Launch\n\nOn the private banking side, Robinhood is planning a launch rate of 4% yield (APY) for savings accounts. The company will also launch a private banking product for its \u201cGold\u201d subscribers later this year, with real estate planning and tax advice.\n\nThe new offerings will initially target Robinhood Gold subscribers on early access requests, with plans to extend access to all clients. A unique feature includes on-demand cash delivery, allowing customers to receive cash directly at their doorsteps, subject to geographic limitations. Clients will also be able to order checkbooks, pay bills and send international money transfers for free.\n\nIn addition, Robinhood is also launching a personalized wealth management products under the brand \u201cRobinhood Strategies,\u201d with a 0.25% annual fee and capped at $250 for its premium 'Gold' subscribers.\n\nThe offering will enable consumers to invest in single stocks and exchange-traded funds while reducing taxable gains. HOOD will also enhance its wealth management services with an artificial intelligence offering -- Robinhood Cortex. It will help investors to optimize their portfolios with analysis and insights.\n\nSteph Guild, senior director, Investment Strategy, Robinhood Financial, emphasized the company\u2019s strategic positioning. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing a critical gap in wealth management,\u201d Guild said, positioning the service between expensive traditional advisors and generic robo-advisors.\n\nHOOD\u2019s Recent Developments\n\nRobinhood continues to diversify its product base to acquire clients and gain market share. In February 2025, the company completed the $300-million acquisition of TradePMR, a custodial and portfolio management platform specializing in services for registered investment advisers (RIAs). The acquisition positions Robinhood within the rapidly growing $7-trillion RIA industry. RIAs deliver fiduciary financial advice tailored to clients\u2019 unique goals and circumstances \u2014 a service increasingly sought after by Robinhood\u2019s maturing customer base.\n\nIn January 2025, the company launched Futures (a nine-figure revenue business, according to the company). In December 2024, it introduced the Tax Lots feature for its investors.\n\nThus, rapid product innovations through vertical integration will likely expand the company\u2019s client base, enabling greater operating leverage and paving the way for sustained profitability.\n\nOther Finance Stocks' Efforts to Boost Business\n\nLast year, Barclays PLC BCS announced its intention to accelerate growth in its Private Banking and Wealth Management segment by increasing its headcount and hiring up to 100 advisers. BCS aims to grow its wealth management capabilities to offset declining revenues from lending as interest rates come down.\n\nOther global banks, such as HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC, have also taken this route. This September, The Guardian reported that HSBC aims to strengthen the U.K. arm of its wealth and private banking operations by recruiting more relationship managers.\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

            "content": "recently reported its full-year 2024 earnings, showcasing significant growth with net interest income increasing by approximately $2.4 billion, and net income more than doubling from the previous year. The company's basic and diluted EPS also saw substantial improvements, reflecting a strong enhancement in shareholder value. Despite a broadly challenging market, with major indices experiencing declines amid geopolitical uncertainties and new tariffs announced on automobile imports, Nu\u2019s stock remained relatively stable. This resilience aligns with the company's robust earnings, which likely supported its performance during this period.\n\nNYSE:NU Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last three years, Nu Holdings has achieved a total return of 28.41%, reflecting its effective strategies and robust operational growth, despite recently underperforming the US Banks industry over the past year. The company's expansion into secured lending and new services has been a pivotal factor in this success, diversifying revenue streams and enhancing financial resilience. Significant increases in net interest income and net income, as demonstrated in its 2024 results where net income reached nearly $2 billion, have also played a crucial role in supporting its long-term performance.\n\nAdditionally, while recent removal from indices like the S&P Global BMI Index may pose challenges, the company's inclusion in indices like the FTSE All-World Index in 2023 highlights its growing global presence. Furthermore, the continued expansion in key markets such as Mexico and Colombia has contributed to its financial stability, supported by strong deposit growth, which boosts liquidity and net interest margins. Nu Holdings' focus on technology and cost-efficiency remains integral to sustaining profitability and shareholder returns.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "A group of mostly local businesses, including the Azzopardi Group, Gasan Group and Virtu Holdings, as well as current Lombard Bank CEO Joe Said, have submitted a bid for HSBC, according to sources.\n\nThe group is believed to be composed of between 10 and 12 companies and private investors.\n\nAlthough most of the involved parties in the group are local, it also includes several foreign private investors.\n\nRELATED STORIES HSBC\u2019s potential exit from Malta: the inside story\n\nIt is unclear whether Said is involved in the group on behalf of Lombard Bank or in some other capacity.\n\nThe group includes several of Malta\u2019s best known business leaders.\n\nAzzopardi Group, most synonymous with its very first company, Azzopardi Fisheries, operates several prominent outlets in the food retail and importation industry, including Miracle Foods, Spar and Valhmor.\n\nGasan Group is a household name with a presence across several industries, from cars to insurance and property.\n\nMeanwhile, Virtu Holdings is best known for Virtu Ferries, a passenger ferry service between Malta and Sicily.\n\nAzzopardi Group, Gasan Group, Virtu Ferries and Said were all contacted by Times of Malta, but the group remains tight-lipped over the deal.\n\nA spokesperson for Virtu Ferries said they are \u201cnot aware\u201d of the company\u2019s involvement in the group, while Gasan Group and Azzopardi Group both declined to comment, with a spokesperson for the former saying that they \u201cdo not speculate on such activities\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Said abruptly ended the call when first contacted by phone and did not respond to a written request for comment.\n\nFirst known bid by private investors\n\nThe consortium follows APS Bank and Hungarian bank OTP as the third known bidder for the bank.\n\nBut this is the first known bid submitted by private investors, rather than exclusively by an established bank.\n\nIndustry insiders told Times of Malta that the European Central Bank, which would need to sign off on the deal, is typically wary of bank takeovers by investors from outside the banking world.\n\nMalta must find itself with a bank that has a \u2018good reputation\u2019\n\n\u201cThere is a huge focus on banking stability at the European level,\u201d one industry source said. \u201cThere have been cases in which investors tried to buy a bank, but the regulator stepped in.\u201d\n\nAnother industry source argued that \u201cECB is already not particularly happy about MeDirect\u2019s ownership\u201d. MeDirect is owned by a private investment group.\n\nBut would regulators agree to OTP?\n\nSeveral banking experts also questioned what regulators would make of OTP\u2019s bid, revealed by Times of Malta on Wednesday.\n\nMany agreed with Finance Minister Clyde Caruana, who raised the spectre of reputational damage, warning that Malta must find itself with a bank that has a \u201cgood reputation\u201d at the end of the process.\n\nIn 2023, OTP was included in a list of international sponsors of war by Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Agency over its continued operation in Russia, prompting a diplomatic dispute. The bank was removed from the list a few months later.\n\nOTP has strongly rejected the reasons behind its inclusion on the list. In a letter to Times of Malta, it said that it keeps a \u201cclear and firm distance from politics and personal entanglements\u201d and that it does not \u201cmaintain any relationship with political actors that deviates from accepted western standards\u201d.\n\n\u201cMalta needs more banking competition but is OTP the alternative?\u201d stockbroker Paul Bonello asked when contacted by Times of Malta.\n\n\u201cThere are good reasons to object to such a purchaser, I am positive that ECB would find an objection.\u201d\n\nBut other industry insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity say that any concerns are likely to emerge from the fact that the bank is Hungarian (\u201cthe bad boy of Europe,\u201d one source said), rather than any particular wrongdoing by the bank itself.\n\n\u201cOTP is a fine bank,\u201d one insider said. \u201cEvery bank has skeletons in its cupboard, including HSBC, so there\u2019s nothing to suggest OTP is particularly different.\u201d\n\nAnother industry insider agreed. \u201cOTP is not a bad bank, but there are problems with the jurisdiction,\u201d they said. \u201cAs a bank, there is nothing to suggest it has been found guilty of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOTP had to walk a fine line over the Russian invasion,\u201d they added. \u201cOn the one hand, they can\u2019t break with their own government\u2019s line, which was quite sympathetic to Russia, but they also had to deal with Europe\u2019s response to the invasion.\u201d\n\nChurch bank APS officially confirmed it had submitted a non-binding offer to acquire HSBC last November.",

And right now, I think this pair of FTSE 100 dividend stocks are worth considering to aim for tax-free passive income.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future. The content in this article is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice. Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions.\n\nImperial Brands\n\nFirst up is Imperial Brands (LSE: IMB). Shares of the multinational tobacco company have been on fire, surging 58% over one year and 111% across five. And that\u2019s without factoring in dividends!\n\nYet the good news for income seekers is that this hasn\u2019t dented the stock\u2019s high-yield credentials. Based on forecasts, it\u2019s sporting a 6.1% dividend yield for its next financial year (starting October). That\u2019s well above the average for UK stocks.\n\nThe strong share price performance might surprise some. After all, cigarette sales have been steadily falling worldwide for years, supposedly pushing tobacco companies towards long-term oblivion. Yet the company has just committed to growing its annual operating profits by 3%-5% per year and announced an \u201cevergreen\u201d annual share buyback programme through to 2030.\n\nImperial is behind brands like John Player Special, Lambert & Butler, and Davidoff. It also owns backy brands Golden Virginia, Drum, and Rizla. Many smokers have downgraded to rolling tobacco due to affordability issues with cigarettes.\n\nBy concentrating on key core markets like the US, UK, Germany, Spain, and Australia, Imperial Brands has managed to enhance its profitability and market share.\n\nOf course, the company faces obvious risks with increasing regulation and falling cigarette volumes. It might not achieve its financial targets. And I appreciate that tobacco stocks might not be ethical in the eyes of some investors.\n\nBut the dividends look affordable, as the forecast payouts are covered twice over by anticipated earnings. In short, this doesn\u2019t appear to be a company in obvious decline.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock still looks decent value, trading at around nine times earnings.\n\nHSBC\n\nThe second stock is banking giant HSBC (LSE: HSBA). The FTSE 100 company\u2019s share price has also done very well, rising 42% over the past year.\n\n\n\nAgain, though, this hasn\u2019t resulted in a low yield or particularly high valuation. The forecast yield for 2026 is 6.2% and the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 8. So I think HSBC stocks still offers decent value.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Well, interest rates are due to come down, which could squeeze the bank\u2019s lending margins and dampen earnings growth. To offset this, HSBC has been restructuring and cutting costs, but we don\u2019t know whether that will be enough.\n\nTaking a longer-term view though, I think the bank\u2019s pivot to higher-growth markets in Asia will pay off. Fuelled by rising disposable income and large populations, this region is tipped for very strong long-term growth.\n\nMeanwhile, HSBC\u2019s dividend cover looks strong and its CET1 capital ratio \u2014 a key measure of a bank\u2019s financial strength \u2014 was a solid 14.9% at the end of 2024. So the company looks in great shape to me.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that no individual dividend is ultimately guaranteed. But I think these two UK stocks are solid long-term picks for investors seeking passive income to consider.",

            "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Banks - Foreign sector have probably already heard of HSBC (HSBC) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, HSBC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Toronto-Dominion Bank has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that HSBC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nHSBC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.81, while TD has a forward P/E of 11.34. We also note that HSBC has a PEG ratio of 1.10. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.54.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HSBC is its P/B ratio of 1.09. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TD has a P/B of 1.41.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help HSBC earn a Value grade of B, while TD has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nHSBC stands above TD thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HSBC is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs had notable inflows \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Lebanon selected Karim Souaid as central bank governor, picking a private-sector finance specialist to lead a long-delayed overhaul of the financial sector and kickstart an economic recovery.\n\nSeventeen ministers out of the 24-member cabinet voted to name Souaid, a break with the traditional way of naming candidates for such a high-ranking post. Lebanon\u2019s various political factions used to seek consensus on a nominee before placing an appointment on the cabinet\u2019s agenda.\n\nSpeaking after the government session, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said he had his reservations about naming Souaid and urged the new governor to commit to the cabinet\u2019s mission statement to protect depositors money and engage with the International Monetary Fund for a new loan program.\n\nSouaid is a founder of Dubai-based private equity firm Growthgate Partners, and previously worked as a managing director of global investment banking at HSBC Holdings Plc in the Middle East. He\u2019s led privatization mandates in Qatar, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, according to Growthgate\u2019s website.\n\nSouaid becomes only Lebanon\u2019s second central bank governor in more than three decades, after Riad Salameh held the position for four terms from 1993 to 2023. Salameh was a constant throughout the country\u2019s many political and financial crises and maintained a US-dollar peg during his lengthy run.\n\nThat all changed in 2019, when Lebanon\u2019s exchange rate unraveled and local lenders and the central bank were propelled to the forefront of the country\u2019s worst financial crisis. Inflation hit triple digits and people lost their life-savings as banks imposed de-facto capital controls on dollar withdrawals.\n\nPrevious Lebanese governments have suggested banks need to cough up billions to repay their customers, while lenders insist that recovering deposits should be the sole responsibility of the state. But before that can happen, the IMF has said Lebanon should carry out a bank-by-bank assessment to better understand the deficit in the financial sector and unlock a loan program.\n\nLebanon defaulted on some $30 billion of international bonds in 2020 at the height of its financial meltdown, when inflows started dwindling and confidence in the country\u2019s ability to repay debt plummeted.\n\nAuthorities will need to hold talks with bondholders over the defaulted debt. The central bank holds $5 billion of Eurobonds and Lebanese lenders hold another $3 billion, down from about $15 billion at the start of the crisis.\n\nLebanon has seen an unlikely political turnaround this year after a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that\u2019s based in the country. The severe weakening of the US-designated terrorist organization helped lawmakers overcome years of disagreements to appoint a president, prime minister and a new cabinet.\n\nThe progress has spurred a 37% rally in the country\u2019s defaulted bonds since Jan. 1, on top of a 114% surge in 2024, most of which occurred after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in November.\n\nA member of the New York State Bar Association, Souaid holds a law degree from Lebanon\u2019s St. Joseph University and a Master\u2019s in Law from Harvard Law School.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC plans to boost its investment banking (IB) operations in Asia and the Middle East following its exit from key businesses in Europe and the United States. This was stated by Georges Elhedery, CEO of HSBC, in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nDetails of HSBC\u2019s Initiative\n\nThe bank will primarily focus on debt and other financing activities globally, as well as mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets in Asia and the Middle East. HSBC aims to invest in areas where it holds a stronger competitive edge to generate \u201cquality\u201d revenues.\n\nElhedery stated that HSBC's ongoing withdrawal from Europe and the Americas is aimed at enabling the bank to focus on areas where it can offer differentiated services to its customers. He highlighted that debt, including debt capital markets, leveraged and acquisition finance, and other financing activities, remain fundamental to the bank\u2019s global strategy.\n\nElhedery further said that the company will continue to invest in Hong Kong, as it is the heart of HSBC and is set to become a top cross-border wealth hub.\n\nRationale Behind HSBC\u2019s Expansion Efforts\n\nHSBC\u2019s move aligns with its ongoing restructuring efforts. Elhedery, who succeeded Noel Quinn last September, is leading a major business restructuring initiative. As part of the overhaul, in January 2025, HSBC merged its commercial banking division with its global banking and markets unit, which includes IB. This initiative aims to mitigate costs by reducing the bank\u2019s expensive layer of senior staff. The bank aims to achieve nearly $1.5 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2026. The company will likely incur nearly $1.8 billion in total severance and other upfront charges by the end of next year to implement business simplification efforts. Also, HSBC plans to redeploy $1.5 billion of additional costs to priority growth areas over the medium term.\n\nIn sync with this, last week, Bloomberg reported that HSBC is in the negotiation stage to sell its German fund administration business to private equity firm BlackFin Capital Partners. Earlier this month, HSBC announced the sale of its private client trust business \u2014 HSBC Trust Company (UK) Limited \u2014 to Ludlow Trust.\n\nAlso, last month, Reuters reported that HSBC is reducing half of its personnel (about 900) at its China digital wealth business, Pinnacle. Further, in January 2025, the company announced plans to close its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and some equities businesses in Europe, the UK and the Americas to enhance its focus on the Asian region. In the same month, HSBC closed its payments app, Zing, just a year after it launched the digital challenger.\n\nIn October 2024, the company announced an initiative to simplify its organizational structure and operate through four distinct lines of business \u2014 Hong Kong, UK, Corporate & Institutional Banking, and International Wealth & Premier Banking. The company announced the appointment of leadership teams across the segments in December 2024.\n\nHSBC\u2019s Zacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nOver the past year, shares of HSBC have rallied 49.7%, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 24.1%.\n\nCurrently, HSBC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRestructuring Efforts by Other Foreign Banks\n\nEarlier this month, the Financial Times reported that Deutsche Bank DB plans to cut about 2,000 jobs in its retail banking division this year, with a reduction in the number of branches.\n\nThis reflects a continuation of DB\u2019s efforts to streamline operations and achieve financial targets by the end of the year.\n\nSimilarly, Reuters reported that Barclays PLC BCS intends to axe unrewarding customer relationships and further reduce the proportion of capital allocated to its investment bank as it accelerates its efforts to deploy capital toward higher-revenue-generating businesses.\n\nThis move is part of the three-year plan announced by BCS in February 2024 to save \u00a32 billion from its cost base and redeploy its capital toward domestic businesses.\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

Group and local Material Risk Takers may be subject to longer vesting periods of up to seven years, as required under the relevant remuneration regulations. Awards may be subject to a six- or 12-month retention period following vesting. Immediately vested share awards may be subject to a six- or 12-month retention period following vesting. The Company views it as appropriate for the immediately vested share awards to vest immediately and not to be subject to a vesting period for two reasons: 1) The immediately vested share award is a non-deferred portion of the Material Risk Takers remuneration, which must be partly delivered in shares to comply with UK regulation; each employee will also be granted a deferred share award for which the vesting schedule is noted above. 2) The immediately vested share award is subject to a retention period of six- or 12-months, during which time the shares cannot be sold. The vesting period for buy-out awards for new hires generally mirror those of the forfeited awards from the previous employer. Where the forfeited award was subject to a post vesting retention period, a retention period will be applied to the buy-out award. Performance Targets and Clawback No performance targets apply to any Plan Awards on the basis that the Awards are a form of deferred bonus to meet regulatory requirements in the UK. Performance targets instead attach to the initial award of the Variable Pay. Buy-out awards are subject to clawback where the forfeited award of the relevant employee's former employer was subject to clawback. Where the employee's forfeited award was not subject to clawback, no clawback terms are applied to the replacement HSBC award. Clawback applies to all other Plan Awards in line with the Company's regulatory obligations as set out in the Company's internal clawback policy. Arrangements for the Company or a subsidiary to provide financial assistance to the grantees None Number of shares available for future grant under the plan mandate The Plan is subject to two limits on the number of Shares committed to be issued under all Plan Awards: 1. 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day, less the number of Shares which have been issued, or may be issued, to satisfy Awards under the Plan, or options or awards under any other employee share plan operated by the Company granted in the previous 10 years. The number of Shares available to issue under this limit is 1,034,314,531. 2. 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day, less the number of Shares which have been issued, or may be issued, to satisfy Awards under the Plan. The number of Shares available to issue under this limit is 302,089,359.\n\nFor and on behalf of\n\nHSBC Holdings plc\n\nAileen Taylor\n\nCompany Secretary\n\nThe Board of Directors of HSBC Holdings plc as at the date of this announcement comprises: Sir Mark Edward Tucker*, Georges Bahjat Elhedery, Geraldine Joyce Buckingham\u2020, Rachel Duan\u2020, Dame Carolyn Julie Fairbairn\u2020, James Anthony Forese\u2020, Ann Frances Godbehere\u2020, Steven Craig Guggenheimer\u2020, Manveen (Pam) Kaur, Dr Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a\u2020, Kalpana Jaisingh Morparia\u2020, Eileen K Murray\u2020, Brendan Robert Nelson\u2020 and Swee Lian Teo\u2020.\n\n* Non-executive Group Chairman\n\n\u2020 Independent non-executive Director\n\nHSBC Holdings plc\n\nRegistered Office and Group Head Office:\n\n8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ, United Kingdom Web: www.hsbc.com\n\nIncorporated in England and Wales with limited liability.

(EDMOND TANG / CHINA DAILY)\n\nHong Kong is expected to outperform Switzerland as the world\u2019s top wealth hub by 2027 to 2028, leveraging its role as a critical link between the Chinese mainland, Asia, and the global market, Mark Tucker, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, said at the HSBC Global Investment Summit on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the three-day event themed New Networks Connecting the Global Economy, officials and business insiders said, despite evolving geopolitical and trade dynamics, China\u2019s technological achievements and capital market development are gaining momentum. The funding needs of mainland tech firms could benefit the capital market of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, they added.\n\nTucker said, global trade remains a core catalyst for growth and diversification amid headwinds, as evidenced by the continued increase in trade within regions and between emerging markets.\n\nALSO READ: HSBC Global Investment Summit opens in Hong Kong\n\nExports between Asian countries and regions, for instance, surged 31 percent over the past five years and are projected to increase by $400 billion annually through 2030, mainly buoyed by the China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India-ASEAN corridors, he said.\n\n\u201cChina is a central node in these new networks,\u201d Tucker said, adding that the country\u2019s economic transformation has seen \u201cmaterial development\u201d in recent months. The rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has shown the innovative capacity of the country\u2019s private sector, he added.\n\nALSO READ: Boao Forum: HK to capitalize on cooperation opportunities\n\n\u201cThe real opportunity is for China to continue with its process of opening up its market,\u201d Tucker said. Against this backdrop, he said he believes Hong Kong, as a super-connector between the mainland and the rest of the world, can play an important role and should further cement its position as a global financial hub.\n\nTucker also commended the advancement of the country\u2019s draft private sector promotion law, which he said is conducive to the creation of a business-friendly environment that can enhance confidence and promote innovation.\n\nQi Bin, deputy director of the central government\u2019s liaison office in the Hong Kong SAR, delivers a speech at the opening of the HSBC Global Investment Summit at the Conrad Hong Kong on March 25, 2025. (EDMOND TANG / CHINA DAILY)\n\nQi Bin, deputy director of the central government\u2019s liaison office in the Hong Kong SAR, said he also regarded Beijing\u2019s backing of private enterprises as an important factor in the recovery of the SAR\u2019s capital market.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s Feb 17 meeting with leaders of private businesses \u201csent a clear signal of policy stability and support, which boosted the confidence of global investors\u201d, Qi said.\n\nREAD MORE: Chan: Hong Kong a catalyst for global economic cooperation\n\nJoe Tsai Chung-Hsin, co-founder and chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, said he has seen \u201ca very clear sign (among) businesses\u201d that entrepreneurs have become more confident following the meeting with President Xi. They have fresh confidence to reinvest in themselves and hire more people, Tsai said.\n\nJoe Tsai Chung-Hsin, co-founder and chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, speaks during a fireside chat session at the HSBC Global Investment Summit at the Conrad Hong Kong on March 25, 2025. (EDMOND TANG / CHINA DAILY)\n\nThe Hang Seng Index, the benchmark of Hong Kong\u2019s bourse, had surged more than 20 percent as of mid-March, its highest level since February 2022. Daily market turnover reached nearly $26 billion at the end of February, up around 140 percent year-on-year.\n\n\u201cThe recent positive momentum of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and social development shows that the key to Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth is financial market development,\u201d said Qi. Meanwhile, solidifying the strength of the HKSAR\u2019s capital market is an \u201cobvious choice\u201d to promote the country\u2019s technological innovation and industrial upgrades, he added.\n\nHe said, the central government will continue to support the \u201caccelerated integration\u201d of the city\u2019s capital market with high-tech firms from the mainland. Hong Kong can help these companies that have emerged in the AI and robotics sectors recently in fundraising and empower them to grow as potential global leaders, he added.\n\nirisli@chinadailyhk.com",

It largely depends on your individual circumstances, like your credit score, the size of your deposit, and how long you\u2019re planning to stay in the property.\u201d\n\nFinally, Barratt advised actions that savers could take to secure a good interest rate on their mortgage.\n\nThis included improving their credit score, saving for a larger deposit, shopping around and comparing offers, considering the type of mortgage, timing the application wisely, and getting pre-approved.\n\ntom.dunstan@ft.com\n\nWhat\u2019s your view?\n\nHave your say in the comments section below or email us: ftadviser.newsdesk@ft.com",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- HSBC Holdings Plc expects to double down on its investment banking operations in Asia and the Middle East after exiting key business in Europe and the US, Chief Executive Officer Georges Elhedery said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe bank will focus on debt and other financing activities in Asia as well as mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets in the Middle East, Elhedery said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday at an HSBC conference in Hong Kong. The restructuring will save $1.5 billion in efficiency costs and enable the bank to invest in areas where it has more competitive edge to generate \u201cquality\u201d revenue, he said.\n\nTaking the helm about six months ago, Elhedery has unleashed a sweeping overhaul at the bank, leading to the exit of several senior executives. He combined the commercial and investment banking units and made operations in the UK and Hong Kong standalone businesses. He shuttered most of its mergers and acquisition and equity underwriting operations in the US, UK and continental Europe.\n\n\u201cThe exit that we are processing now in Europe and the Americas is to allow us to focus at the areas where we can really be differentiating to our customers,\u201d said Elhedery.\n\nThe restructuring has been endorsed by top shareholder Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., which last week said it\u2019s \u201cvery happy\u201d with the direction, marking a dramatic shift in tone from its combative stance during a dispute with HSBC back in 2022.\n\nShares of the London-based lender have rallied almost 30% in Hong Kong since Elhedery took over on Sept. 2.\n\nRewarding\n\nThe CEO has been removing layers of management from the top down, cutting the number of executives who sit on the re-named key operating committee to 12 from 18. Job cuts across the bank have focused on senior managers, even placing some investment bankers on short-term work arrangements.\n\nHSBC asked hundreds of managers to reapply for jobs in the firm\u2019s newly formed corporate and institutional banking division. Several top executives, including Nuno Matos \u2014 who ran wealth and personal banking and was Elhedery\u2019s main rival for the CEO role \u2014 have also exited.\n\nHSBC will incur $1.8 billion in mostly severance costs, and most of the decisions will take place in the first half of the year, said Elhedery.",

            "content": "From AI investments to cybersecurity demands, businesses face mounting expenses that threaten profitability, forcing them to rethink operations and explore cost-saving strategies like outsourcing.\n\nHSBC Holdings is exploring outsourcing parts of its fixed-income trading business in a bid to reduce escalating technology-related costs and stay competitive against more agile, tech-driven rivals. According to a Bloomberg report published Monday, the bank is in preliminary discussions with major market makers, including Citadel Securities and Jane Street Group, about directing some of its trading order flow to external firms.\n\nThe proposed outsourcing strategy would allow HSBC to retain direct client relationships while offloading key functions such as analytics, order execution, and underlying technology to specialized firms. If implemented, this move could save the bank millions in IT costs associated with maintaining its global trading infrastructure.\n\nThe discussions come as part of a broader restructuring under CEO Georges Elhedery, who took over in July. Since his appointment, HSBC has aggressively streamlined its operations, cutting hundreds of senior roles, scaling back dealmaking activities in Western markets, and reorganizing various business segments to enhance efficiency and focus on core strengths.\n\nHSBC\u2019s potential shift aligns with a broader trend in global finance. Non-bank liquidity providers like Citadel Securities and Jane Street have gained significant market share in recent years, increasingly handling trading flows traditionally dominated by banks. A report from Boston Consulting Group indicates that non-bank market makers now account for 26% of global market revenues, more than doubling their share over the past six years. In contrast, European banks have seen their share of global trading revenue decline by 10 percentage points to 29% over the past eight years.\n\nOutsourcing trading functions is a bold but strategic step for HSBC, reflecting a changing financial landscape where advanced technology and algorithmic trading play a crucial role in maintaining competitive advantage. By leveraging external expertise, HSBC can focus on client relationships and strategic growth while reducing the financial burden of maintaining cutting-edge trading technology in-house.\n\nThe move also underscores the increasing pressure on traditional banks to rethink their business models amid rising technology costs and shifting market dynamics. While no formal agreement has been reached, the outcome of HSBC\u2019s discussions with Citadel Securities and Jane Street could signal a broader shift among global banks towards more cost-effective and tech-driven trading solutions.\n\nAs HSBC navigates these challenges, the potential outsourcing strategy could set a precedent for other financial institutions grappling with similar issues. If successful, it may mark the beginning of a new era where banks rely more on specialized firms to handle their trading operations, allowing them to focus on high-value services and long-term growth strategies.",

            "content": "[HONG KONG] HSBC Holdings expects to double down on investment banking operations in Asia and the Middle East after exiting key business in Europe and the US, chief executive officer Georges Elhedery said in an interview with Bloomberg Television at an HSBC conference in Hong Kong.\n\nElhedery said the bank has \u201cgreat momentum\u201d and expects to reallocate US$1.5 billion in efficiencies into areas of growth and strength. The bank is \u201chappy with its footprint\u201d and will double down on capabilities on debt and financing as well as Middle East equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions, he said.\n\nTaking the helm about six months ago, Elhedery has unleashed a sweeping overhaul at the bank, leading to the exit of several senior executives. He combined the commercial and investment banking units and made operations in the UK and Hong Kong standalone businesses. He shuttered most of its mergers and acquisitions and equity underwriting operations in the US, UK and continental Europe.\n\nThe restructuring has been endorsed by top shareholder Ping An Insurance (Group), which last week said it is \u201cvery happy\u201d with the direction taken by Elhedery, marking a dramatic shift in tone from its combative stance during a year-long fight with HSBC back in 2022.\n\nShares of the London-based lender have rallied almost 30 per cent in Hong Kong since Elhedery took over on Sep 2.\n\nHSBC will incur US$1.8 billion in charges over the next two years because of the global restructuring. The decisions, which are mainly on severance, are largely done, according to Elhedery.\n\nElhedery has been removing layers of management from the top down, cutting the number of executives who sit on the re-named key operating committee to 12 from 18. Job cuts across the bank have focused on senior managers, even placing some investment bankers on short-term work arrangements. BLOOMBERG",

Learn More .\n\nA recent weakening in UK share prices gives investors a great chance to go bargain shopping. The FTSE 100 alone has long been considered a great hunting ground for value shares by analysts. This recent fall has only enhanced its reputation.\n\nRight now I\u2019m seeking blue-chip companies that trade on low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. I\u2019m also looking for Footsie shares with high dividend yields. It\u2019s a combination that could deliver healthy capital appreciation when market confidence recovers. In the meantime, there\u2019s a solid passive income.\n\nHere are three of my favourites today.\n\nM&G\n\nFinancial services businesses like M&G (LSE:MNG) can deliver underwhelming returns during periods of poor economic growth and higher inflation. Both of these remain risks looking ahead, and particularly as new trade tariffs loom.\n\nBut I still believe this company\u2019s long-term outlook remains undimmed, making it a solid stock for patient investors to consider. The rising importance of financial planning, combined with ageing populations in its markets, provides enormous earnings opportunities.\n\nIn the meantime, M&G can use its cash-rich balance sheet to continue investing for growth and paying large dividends. As of the end of 2024, its Solvency II capital ratio was 223%, up a whopping 20% from a year earlier.\n\nWith a P/E ratio of just 9.3 times and a 9.4% dividend yield, I think M&G shares offer excellent all-round value.\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC (LSE:HSBA) faces the same macroeconomic threats as M&G. On top of this, it may have to endure a drop in net interest margins if (as expected) global interest rates keep falling.\n\nYet I believe these threats are reflected in its low P/E ratio of nine times. I\u2019m also encouraged by its continued resilience in tough conditions, as illustrated by its forecast-beating results for the fourth quarter (when pre-tax profit rose 6% to $32.3bn).\n\nI think profits and dividends here could rise strongly as banking product demand heats up in emerging markets. HSBC is steadily winding down its Western operations and prioritising capital in high-growth Asia to capitalise on this opportunity, too.\n\nWith a CET1 capital ratio (a measure of solvency) of 14.9%, HSBC also looks in good shape to pay another large dividend. The yield here for 2025 is 5.7%.\n\nLondonmetric Property\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) like Londonmetric Property (LSE:LMP) are designed to provide maximum dividends to investors. In exchange for tax perks, they must pay a minimum of 90% of annual rental profits out in dividends.\n\nAs a consequence, the dividend yield on this Footsie share is currently 6.7%.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future. The content in this article is provided for information purposes only. It is not intended to be, neither does it constitute, any form of tax advice.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s attracted my eye. With a P/E ratio of 13.8 times, it\u2019s also cheaper based on predicted earnings than peers Tritax Big Box (16.1 times), Warehouse REIT (17.7 times), and Urban Logistics (18 times).\n\nLondonmetric\u2019s assets straddle four main industries: logistics, leisure, convenience retail, and healthcare. This provides earnings resilience across all points of the economic cycle, a key quality for long-term dividend income.\n\nHigher-than-usual interest rates are currently a drag on asset values. But I still think it\u2019s worth a close look at current prices.",

            "content": "Further, efforts taken by most banks to diversify revenues to become less dependent on spread income are likely to aid non-interest income. Also, lower interest rates will lead to the revival of investment banking business and support wealth/asset management operations. Hence, industry players are likely to record an increase in revenues in the coming quarters.\n\nRelatively Lower Interest Rates: The central banks globally have started lowering interest rates as inflation numbers gradually cool. This is expected to support foreign banks\u2019 net interest income (NII) and margin, which were under pressure because of rising funding/deposit costs. With falling rates and decent economic growth, demand for loans is expected to improve. Industry players are likely to witness NII expansion.\n\nThe financial firms establish relations with U.S. corporations operating in their home countries. Some units of foreign banks offer a broad range of wholesale and retail services and conduct money-market transactions for their parent organizations. Some industry players are involved in developing only specialized services like wealth/asset management and investment banking.\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry consists of overseas banks with operations in the United States. Since a foreign banking organization may have federal and state-chartered offices in the country, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in supervising their U.S. operations. In addition to providing a broad range of products and services to customers in the United States, the banks offer financial services to corporate clients having businesses in the country.\n\nDespite geopolitical and macroeconomic woes, industry players like HSBC Holdings plc , Barclays PLC and NatWest Group plc are well-placed to gain from business streamlining efforts and low rates.\n\nBanks worldwide have been continuously restructuring their businesses to focus on core operations. While these initiatives are expected to result in elevated expenses, they will drive growth in the long run. While the uneven economic recovery in developed and emerging nations has been hurting revenue growth for companies within the Zacks Foreign Banks Industry, relatively lower interest rates will provide support.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRestructuring Efforts: Several foreign banks are undertaking business restructuring initiatives. Many banks have been divesting or closing non-core operations to increase focus on core businesses and profitable markets. Through this, industry players are changing their revenue mix and aiming to expand to other lucrative operations.\n\nUneven Global Economic Recovery: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic recovery has been uneven. In many regions, economic growth has slowed down but not fully recovered from the pandemic effect, while geopolitical headwinds are hurting the economy in others. Banks\u2019 performances are directly linked to the performance of the overall economy. Weak economic growth in their home markets may hurt foreign banks\u2019 profitability to some extent in the upcoming period.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry is a 64-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is because of the encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The aggregate earnings estimate revisions show that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s growth potential. Since November 2024, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for 2025 have been revised 4.2% upward.\n\nHence, we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to invest in. But before that, let us check out the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry has outperformed the S&P 500 and its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have collectively risen 22.9%. The S&P 500 composite has rallied 9.5%, and the Zacks Finance Sector has appreciated 15.6%.\n\nIndustry's Valuation\n\nOne might get a good sense of the industry\u2019s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing foreign banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.\n\nThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 2.38X. This compares with the highest level of 2.39X, the lowest level of 0.79X and the median of 1.66X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&P 500 composite is 12.97X.\n\nAs finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing foreign banks with the S&P 500 might not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group\u2019s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that it is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance Sector\u2019s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 5.78X and the median level of 4.56X for the same period are above the Zacks Foreign Banks Industry\u2019s ratios.\n\n3 Foreign Bank Stocks to Consider\n\nHSBC: Headquartered in London, HSBC is a major global banking and financial services firm with $3.02 trillion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. The company has been committed to bolstering its performance, focusing on building operations across Asia. It intends to position itself as a top bank for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients in the region.\n\nIn sync with its Asia pivot strategy, HSBC acquired Citigroup's retail wealth management business in China and Singapore-based SilkRoad Property Partners Group. Also, it re-launched its private banking business in India.\n\nHSBC has been restructuring its operations to improve operating efficiency.

            "content": "Banks worldwide have been continuously restructuring their businesses to focus on core operations. While these initiatives are expected to result in elevated expenses, they will drive growth in the long run. While the uneven economic recovery in developed and emerging nations has been hurting revenue growth for companies within the Zacks Foreign Banks Industry, relatively lower interest rates will provide support.\n\nDespite geopolitical and macroeconomic woes, industry players like HSBC Holdings plc HSBC, Barclays PLC BCS and NatWest Group plc NWG are well-placed to gain from business streamlining efforts and low rates.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry consists of overseas banks with operations in the United States. Since a foreign banking organization may have federal and state-chartered offices in the country, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in supervising their U.S. operations. In addition to providing a broad range of products and services to customers in the United States, the banks offer financial services to corporate clients having businesses in the country. The financial firms establish relations with U.S. corporations operating in their home countries. Some units of foreign banks offer a broad range of wholesale and retail services and conduct money-market transactions for their parent organizations. Some industry players are involved in developing only specialized services like wealth/asset management and investment banking.\n\n3 Themes to Influence Foreign Bank Industry\n\nRelatively Lower Interest Rates: The central banks globally have started lowering interest rates as inflation numbers gradually cool. This is expected to support foreign banks\u2019 net interest income (NII) and margin, which were under pressure because of rising funding/deposit costs. With falling rates and decent economic growth, demand for loans is expected to improve. Industry players are likely to witness NII expansion. Further, efforts taken by most banks to diversify revenues to become less dependent on spread income are likely to aid non-interest income. Also, lower interest rates will lead to the revival of investment banking business and support wealth/asset management operations. Hence, industry players are likely to record an increase in revenues in the coming quarters.\n\nRestructuring Efforts: Several foreign banks are undertaking business restructuring initiatives. Many banks have been divesting or closing non-core operations to increase focus on core businesses and profitable markets. Through this, industry players are changing their revenue mix and aiming to expand to other lucrative operations.\n\nUneven Global Economic Recovery: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic recovery has been uneven. In many regions, economic growth has slowed down but not fully recovered from the pandemic effect, while geopolitical headwinds are hurting the economy in others. Banks\u2019 performances are directly linked to the performance of the overall economy. Weak economic growth in their home markets may hurt foreign banks\u2019 profitability to some extent in the upcoming period.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry is a 64-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #47, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is because of the encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The aggregate earnings estimate revisions show that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s growth potential. Since November 2024, the industry\u2019s earnings estimates for 2025 have been revised 4.2% upward.\n\nHence, we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to invest in. But before that, let us check out the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Versus S&P 500 and Sector\n\nThe Zacks Foreign Banks Industry has outperformed the S&P 500 and its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have collectively risen 22.9%. The S&P 500 composite has rallied 9.5%, and the Zacks Finance Sector has appreciated 15.6%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Valuation\n\nOne might get a good sense of the industry\u2019s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing foreign banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.\n\nThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 2.38X. This compares with the highest level of 2.39X, the lowest level of 0.79X and the median of 1.66X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a significant discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TB for the S&P 500 composite is 12.97X, which the chart below shows.\n\nPrice-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)\n\nAs finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing foreign banks with the S&P 500 might not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group\u2019s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that it is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance Sector\u2019s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 5.78X and the median level of 4.56X for the same period are above the Zacks Foreign Banks Industry\u2019s ratios.\n\nPrice-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)\n\n3 Foreign Bank Stocks to Consider\n\nHSBC: Headquartered in London, HSBC is a major global banking and financial services firm with $3.02 trillion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. The company has been committed to bolstering its performance, focusing on building operations across Asia. It intends to position itself as a top bank for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients in the region.\n\nIn sync with its Asia pivot strategy, HSBC acquired Citigroup's retail wealth management business in China and Singapore-based SilkRoad Property Partners Group. Also, it re-launched its private banking business in India.\n\nHSBC has been restructuring its operations to improve operating efficiency. In October 2024, the company announced an initiative to simplify its organizational structure, which became effective on Jan. 1, 2025. Driven by this restructuring initiative, it targets to achieve almost $1.5 billion of annualized savings by 2026-end. The company will likely incur nearly $1.8 billion in total severance and other upfront charges by the end of next year to implement business simplification efforts.\n\nIn sync with this, HSBC announced the winding down of its investment banking activities in the U.K., Europe and the United States, and the divestiture of its French life insurance arm, HSBC Assurances Vie (France) and private banking business in Germany. Apart from these, the bank completed the sale of its businesses in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia, as well as the retail banking operations in France and Mauritius. It also announced the planned sale of its business in South Africa.\n\nShares of the company have risen 29.3% on the NYSE in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved 1% higher in the past 30 days. Currently, HSBC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HSBC\n\nBarclays: Headquartered in London, Barclays is a major global banking and financial services company with \u00a31,518.2 billion ($1,897.8 billion) in total assets as of Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nBarclays\u2019 initiatives to improve efficiency over the last few years have been bearing fruit, as evident from a fall in expenses. Its total operating expenses decreased in 2024. Overall expenses are expected to remain manageable as business restructuring initiatives continue to provide support.\n\nBCS intends to undertake further cost-saving actions to improve efficiency. The structural cost actions resulted in gross savings of \u00a31 billion in 2024. The company aims to achieve gross efficiency savings of \u00a30.5 billion in 2025. By 2026-end, management expects total gross efficiency savings of \u00a32 billion and the cost-to-income ratio to be in the high 50s.\n\nBarclays has been striving to simplify operations and focus on core businesses. In February 2025, it divested its Germany-based consumer finance business. In November 2024, this Zacks Rank #2 company acquired Tesco\u2019s retail banking business. The move is expected to complement its existing business and strengthen its position in the market. Further, as part of its business overhaul last year, the company announced changes to its operating divisions. Driven by these initiatives, the company\u2019s profitability is expected to improve over time.\n\nBCS shares have soared 27.4% on the NYSE in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2025 earnings has moved 2.5% higher in the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: BCS\n\nNatWest: This Edinburgh, UK-based company operates as a banking and financial services company. NWG provides personal and business banking, consumer loans, asset and invoice finances, commercial and residential mortgages, credit cards and financial planning services, as well as life, personal and income protection insurance.\n\nIn December 2024, Natwest announced that it was set to launch its first Fintech Growth Programme, an exciting opportunity for fintech startups to use the resources, expertise and networks of an established high-street bank to help them scale up sustainably.\n\nFurther, throughout 2024, NatWest has made good progress against its strategic priorities by growing all three of its customer businesses, improving productivity and actively managing capital. These initiatives are expected to support the company\u2019s revenues and improve profitability.\n\nBy 2025 end, NWG expects to achieve a return on tangible equity of 15-16%, and by 2027, the metric is expected to be greater than 15%.\n\nShares of the company have risen 29.2% on the NYSE in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved 7.6% higher in the past 30 days. Currently, NWG sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nPrice and Consensus: NWG\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

The restructuring also includes reducing management layers and scaling back certain operations outside of its core markets.\n\nAs part of these efforts, HSBC is also selling a French mortgage portfolio valued at approximately US$7 billion, according to its full-year earnings report released in February. The bank has reportedly offered to provide financing for the deal.\n\nThe lender has been shifting its focus toward Asia and the Middle East, where it sees stronger growth potential. In a significant strategic move, HSBC recently confirmed the closure of its mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets businesses in the UK, Europe, and the Americas. The decision, which will affect jobs in London and New York, reflects the bank\u2019s struggle to compete in these markets and its decision to prioritise regions where it has a competitive advantage.\n\nWant to be regularly updated with mortgage news and features?

            "content": "UBS Group AG UBS is planning to divest part of its asset management division focused on real estate investments. The business area under review includes mainly Swiss real estate assets and can be worth less than $1 billion.This news was first reported by Reuters, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn June 2024, UBS Group revamped its asset management business and moved some of its real estate assets into a new unit wherein it is bringing together asset management and wealth products. Real estate investments left outside of the new unit are being considered for sale, per Reuters.\n\nRationale Behind UBS\u2019 Plans\n\nUBS Group\u2019s plans to consider selling part of its asset management division come on the heels of the company\u2019s plans to revamp its smallest business unit.\n\nIn February, chief financial officer Todd Tuckner told analysts, without elaborating further, that the bank is considering \"exits of non-strategic businesses\" to improve the profitability of the asset management unit.\n\nUBS's asset management division contributed 6.5% to the bank's total revenues in 2024. It is overshadowed by the bank's wealth management division, which generates more than half of the group's total revenues.\n\nA spokesperson for UBS said the bank has substantial growth ambitions for its asset management division. \"Asset Management is investing in its differentiated and scalable real asset capabilities, including its leading Swiss Real Estate business,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOur Take on UBS Group\u2019s Restructuring Efforts\n\nThis decision to sell part of the asset management unit aligns with UBS\u2019 overall strategy of streamlining its operations, focusing on its core functions following the acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. Since then, UBS has been integrating businesses of Credit Suisse and disposing of unwanted assets.\n\nUBS\u2019 restructuring plan suggests that it might wind down its Non-Core and Legacy portfolio, releasing more than $6 billion in capital by the end of 2026. Also, UBS Group is progressing well with Credit Suisse integration plans.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company completed the migration of its Global Wealth Management client accounts in Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan to UBS platforms.\n\nWith the successful migration of wealth management client accounts across booking centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Luxembourg, UBS Group has now transferred more than 90% of client accounts outside of Switzerland onto UBS platforms. The company expects the Swiss business migrations to commence in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThrough these efforts, the company aims to reach gross cost reductions of $13 billion by 2026-end compared with the 2022 reported level. Since the end of 2022, the company has achieved $7.5 billion or around 58% of total targeted cost savings.\n\nUBS\u2019 Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of the company have gained 11.2% in the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 11%.\n\nCurrently, UBS Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRestructuring Efforts By Other Foreign Banks\n\nBarclays BCS completed the sale of its German consumer finance business, Consumer Bank Europe, to BAWAG P.S.K., a subsidiary of Austria-based BAWAG Group AG. This move aligns with the company\u2019s plan to streamline its operations as outlined in its Investor Update in February 2024.\n\nThis sale is part of BCS\u2019 broader strategy to exit retail banking in Europe, responding to shifts in consumer behavior post-pandemic. In addition to the German sale, Barclays has announced plans to enhance digital banking services in the U.K., and expand its corporate and investment banking presence globally, including new ventures in Asia.\n\nAnother U.K.-based lender, HSBC Holdings HSBC, is actively restructuring its operations in Germany to focus more on its growth strategy in Asia. In sync with this, in September 2024, the company signed an agreement to sell its private banking business in Germany to BNP Paribas. The deal's financial terms, expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, have not been disclosed.\n\nThe transaction, subject to relevant regulatory approvals, is projected to result in a gain on sale for HSBC. It will help simplify the company\u2019s business model and enable it to focus on the global \u201cwholesale banking business.\u201d\n\nThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).\n\nZacks Investment Research",

Quietly, many businesses are standing firm on diversity initiatives.\n\nCompanies from Roche Holding AG to Nissan Motor Co. have backpedaled on DEI policies in the United States. But the Swiss drugmaker says it has no plans to change its inclusion efforts elsewhere, while the Japanese car maker has left its international websites untouched. Volvo AB is going further: The car company hires \u201cbased on meritocracy, not quotas,\u201d its spokesperson said, adding that positive action schemes such as its tecHER program will continue.\n\nIt\u2019s what you might call DEI by stealth \u2014 an approach that, in various forms, has started to become the new normal for global companies outside the United States since Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 20 entitled \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.\u201d\n\nFor American companies, there\u2019s a degree of uncertainty around the directive. While U.S. federal agencies and their suppliers are required to end any form of what Trump calls \u201cillegal DEI,\u201d such as affirmative action in hiring, the order doesn\u2019t definitively say what measures companies are no longer permitted to take. And with robust federal anti-discrimination statutes still in place, it\u2019s not even clear that the directive is lawful.\n\nOutside of the United States, the picture is even more complicated. Companies may wish to avoid unwanted scrutiny from the Trump administration, but complying with the spread of international diversity regulations is non-negotiable.\n\nIn jurisdictions from the United Kingdom and the European Union to Australia and Hong Kong \u2014 where inclusion measures have primarily focused on gender rather than race \u2014 companies are legally required to meet targets for board diversity, gender pay gaps, pay transparency and reintegration of employees after long-term leave. Various countries have other requirements too. In Japan, top publicly listed companies must aim to promote women to 30% of director roles by 2030, up from about 16% last year. In the Netherlands, the financial sector is expected to consider accessibility to ensure older people are not cut off from basic services.\n\nNevertheless, few companies want to put their head above the parapet in the United States, especially those with lucrative government contracts to lose. On top of the executive order, the president\u2019s demand that U.S. government agencies identify as many as nine potential civil compliance investigations in the private sector lit a tinderbox. No company wants to be the first to be accused of breaking the law.\n\nMore than 15 U.S. companies have already altered language around diversity in their annual reports, while European companies are increasingly avoiding the topic on earnings calls.\n\n\u201cUltimately, people are trying to pivot. They\u2019re trying to keep up with what\u2019s going on but without losing sight of that ultimate goal of inclusive workplaces,\u201d said Zamena Ladak, senior vice president for DEI and business development at Assemble HR Consulting, a New Jersey-based talent strategy and leadership development consultancy.\n\nBloomberg contacted more than a dozen companies with headquarters around the world that make a significant portion of their revenue in the United States about their diversity, equity and inclusion plans. Few issued a public statement. But it\u2019s clear that boardrooms are under increasing pressure \u2014 from lawyers as well as staff \u2014 to work out how to tread the DEI tightrope.\n\nLegal obligations\n\nSupporters argue that DEI strategies are about business survival and economic growth, as well as benefits for individual workers. Companies with more gender diversity are more likely to innovate, according to research published in the journal Innovation: Management, Policy & Practice. However, while many firms say they have recruited without bias for decades, few can boast a representative workforce \u2014 in fact, many initiatives have led to even more homogeneity, according to analysis by academics Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev.\n\nCountries where a significant portion of women are economically inactive or underactive are missing a growth opportunity, a particular problem for countries with an aging or shrinking population such as Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and South Korea. In Japan, where a third of the population will be over 65 years old by 2040, the economy is already suffering, while Germany needs an influx of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers a year simply to prevent its labor force from shrinking.\n\nBy helping companies close the gender pay gap and finding other ways to make the workplace more equitable, DEI teams help to keep women working or increase their hours, according to a 2020 report by Mercer Inc.\n\nThey can help companies meet their legal obligations too. In the UK, companies\u2019 responsibilities include avoiding discrimination in hiring and taking \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent sexual harassment. Doing so effectively means firms need to educate staff about what discrimination, harassment and victimization - which can be subtle or inadvertent - look like. \u201cHaving DEI programs helps them comply,\u201d said Georgina Calvert-Lee, an employment lawyer at Bellevue Law.\n\nBut training on controversial topics like unconscious bias has in some cases already been rebranded. Now, there\u2019s \u201cless emphasis on this idea that we\u2019re all biased or terrible people,\u201d said Kate Dodd, an employment lawyer at Pinsent Masons and head of the firm\u2019s Brook Graham diversity and inclusion consultancy. Instead, the focus is on using data to examine why specific minority groups may progress through a firm more slowly or exhibit higher attrition rates.\n\nMany international companies are viewing the DEI retreat in the United States through the lens of a four-year presidential term, according to Alexandra Evreinoff, managing director at INvolve, a London-based diversity and inclusion consultancy that has worked with clients such as Boston Consulting Group, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc.\n\nTwo large European multinational companies that work with the federal government told Bloomberg they won\u2019t alter DEI policies unless the executive order is enforced. The move is seen as being in the best interests of customers and staff, according to a person familiar with the matter who did not wish to speak publicly for fear of reprisals.\n\nWhile Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. wiped references to DEI from its American websites, the Japanese company left its international websites untouched, describing the U.S. changes as part of a global digital restructure \u201cafter many months of planning.\u201d UBS Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti said last month that the Swiss bank was making no changes to its DEI policies \u2014 but its sustainability and annual reports, published Monday, no longer refer to \u201cDE&I.\u201d\n\nAnd several banks headquartered outside the United States, such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc and Banco Santander SA, have publicly reaffirmed their commitments to DEI and workforce representation targets, even as some Wall Street banks have backpedaled. In its annual report, HSBC described having a workforce that reflects society as a \u201cstrategic priority.\u201d In January, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing called DEI \u201cintegral\u201d to the company.\n\n\u201cI know what diversity has brought us on the management board at the top reporting level,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are strong supporters of these programs.\u201d\n\nIn fashion and retail \u2014 sectors where women make up an important part of the consumer base \u2014 companies including Germany-based Adidas AG, Hennes & Mauritz AB and Ikea have explicitly retained their DEI focus. \u201cOur commitments in this area remain unchanged and are closely connected with our company\u2019s purpose,\u201d a spokesperson for H&M said.\n\nSome European pharmaceutical companies are pushing on too with a commitment to inclusive clinical trials, according to people familiar with the situation. Their position is grounded in science as well as business: Testing the efficacy and side effects of new products requires women and individuals from underrepresented groups to take part in drug trials.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a continuous focus on this,\u201d Martin Holst Lange, Novo Nordisk A/S\u2019s development chief, said this month. It\u2019s also important to include patients of diverse socioeconomic status, he said.\n\nIn other sectors, the outlook is more mixed. Consulting giant McKinsey & Co. sent a carefully crafted memo to staff emphasizing that the company is still focused on inclusion, while noting that it abides by local law \u2014 a strong hint that it\u2019s complying with anti-DEI measures in the United States. Deloitte looked ready to drop its diversity policies globally before its partnerships in the UK and Australia said they wouldn\u2019t make any changes locally.\n\nMeanwhile, Accenture Plc was among the first non-U.S.-headquartered companies in any sector to ditch its global DEI policies. All three have a lot to lose by defying Trump. Their combined revenues as federal government contractors were in excess of $7.8 billion in the fiscal year to Sep. 30, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nConservative activism\n\nWhile companies are now scrambling to find the right language to describe their plans around diversity, equity and inclusion, the president\u2019s crusade can\u2019t have come as a total surprise. During his presidential campaign, Trump railed against \u201canti-White racism\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d DEI measures. A blizzard of conservative activism and lawsuits also raged in the lead-up to the elections.\n\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court effectively ended affirmative action concerning race in college admissions, after lawyer and anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum sued Harvard. Even though the ruling didn\u2019t extend to businesses, it created a chilling effect around race-related measures in recruiting.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing a discrimination case brought forward by a white woman who claims she was first denied a promotion and then later demoted because she is heterosexual. If successful, the case could pave the way for more discrimination suits from members of majority groups.\n\nIn the short term, lawyers are urging global companies with an American presence to \u201chit the pause button\u201d on any programs in the United States that might benefit specific demographics, according to INvolve\u2019s Evreinoff.\n\nGlobal companies are looking for \u201ca good balance between the regional approach and the global strategy,\u201d said Evreinoff, given the legal requirements they still have to meet abroad.\n\nEven so, in the UK at least, conversations with professionals in DEI-related roles indicate a subtle shift has taken place over the past two years. The country is among the most advanced in terms of DEI development, but a worsening economic outlook has led to something of a pullback.\n\nA 2024 survey by campaign group Reboot found that about 40% of respondents at financial services firms said budget cuts had hampered DEI efforts.\n\n\u201cThis is where we see who was really committed to diversity, equity, inclusion and for whom this was a matter of compliance,\u201d said Michael Smets, professor of management at Oxford University\u2019s Sai\u0308d Business School.\n\nSense of unease\n\nIn the UK, diversity-focused roles in human resources departments, while below a peak in 2020, have remained steady since 2022, according to the job search website Indeed.\n\nBut the number of senior roles, particularly chief diversity officer, has \u201cfallen off a cliff in EMEA\u201d over the last 18 months, according to Raj Tulsiani, CEO of Green Park, a UK-based recruitment firm that specializes in more equitable leadership. And DEI teams have shrunk at many firms, according to Pinsent Masons\u2019 Dodd.\n\nRight-leaning UK newspapers such as the Daily Mail and the London-based Times have described DEI roles in public organizations such as the police or universities as wasteful spending. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative party, last month described diversity programs as \u201cthe real poison of left-wing progressivism.\u201d\n\nGiven the pace of the retreat in the United States, it remains to be seen what the next 12 months will look like for diversity, equity and inclusion around the world. In an interview, conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has pressured a number of U.S. companies to cancel inclusion programs, called DEI and ESG policies \u201canti-Western\u201d and suggested that he has broader ambitions overseas. \u201cWe pushed this out there and it\u2019s our responsibility to bring it back in,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\n\nYet the United States and other countries may be on a path to diverge further still. The British government has plans to extend mandatory pay gap reporting to ethnic minority workers, while a series of lawsuits over equal pay promises to force companies to consider gender disparity in specific roles, not just across the business. Meanwhile, companies with EU staff are gearing up for pay transparency disclosures from next summer, which will require firms to address any gaps larger than 5%.\n\nEither way, a sense of unease remains pervasive. At one European multinational with a large U.S. presence and a federal contract, there\u2019s a rumor doing the rounds that bots are crawling the websites of private companies, searching for DEI buzzwords that might breach the president\u2019s executive orders.\n\nIn early February, the company took down various DEI-related webpages, before reinstating them a few days later, absent some key phrases and terms. Still, the company has no grander plans to change its inclusion strategy.\n\nFor a lot of companies outside the United States, the focus now is merely \u201crepositioning,\u201d said INvolve\u2019s Evreinoff.\n\n\u201cIt would be complete nonsense to say we\u2019re scrapping everything that\u2019s DEI,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nWith assistance from Claudia Cohen, Jennifer Creery, Ashleigh Furlong, Karoline Kan, Naomi Kresge, Rafaela Lindeberg, Sabah Meddings and Isabel Reynolds",

            "content": "The Trump administration has unnerved investors with its departure from traditional trade policy. The average tax on U.S. imports fell to 2.5% under the previous administration, but the tariffs Trump has imposed or plans to impose would raise that figure to 8.4%, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. That would be the highest level since 1946.\n\nFearing the impact of a trade war on the U.S. economy, investors have rotated away from domestic equities and into international stocks. The three major U.S. market indexes have declined year to date, including a 4% slide in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Meanwhile, several international indexes have generated robust returns, as detailed below:\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe European STOXX Europe 50 index has advanced 8%.\n\nindex has advanced 8%. The British FTSE 100 index has advanced 4%.\n\nindex has advanced 4%. The French CAC 40 index has advanced 9%.\n\nindex has advanced 9%. The German DAX has advanced 15%.\n\nImportantly, the returns above are shown in local currencies. But the U.S. dollar index has fallen over 4% year to date, meaning U.S. currency has become less valuable versus a basket of foreign currencies. Consequently, the STOXX Europe 50 has advanced 13% year to date as measured in U.S. dollars.\n\nInvestors seeking international exposure should consider the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSEMKT: VGK), the best-performing Vanguard index fund year to date. Read on to learn more.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF provides cheap and easy exposure to European stock markets\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF measures the performance of more than 1,200 European stocks. It is heavily weighted toward equities in the United Kingdom (24%), France (16%), and Germany (14%), the three largest economies in Europe.\n\nThe 10 largest holdings in the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF are listed by weight below:\n\nSAP: 2.4% ASML Holding: 2.3% Novo Nordisk: 2.1% Nestl\u00e9: 1.8% Roche Holding: 1.8% AstraZeneca: 1.7% Novartis: 1.7% HSBC Holdings: 1.5% Shell: 1.5% LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton: 1.5%\n\nAmerican stocks crushed European stocks in the last decade, but that trend has reversed course in 2025 due to uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has plummeted since December as the Trump administration has implemented tariffs on imports from several countries.\n\nConsequently, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF has returned 14% year to date, while the S&P 500 has declined 4%. And that outperformance could continue in the remaining months of the year due to discrepancies in economic growth, looser monetary policy, and cheaper stock market valuations.\n\nEuro area gross domestic product (GDP) growth is forecast to accelerate into 2027, while U.S. GDP growth is forecast to decelerate through 2026. Also, the European Central Bank has cut its benchmark rate by 185 basis points and has yet to pause. But the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate by only 100 basis points and has paused its cutting cycle.\n\nFinally, European equities are relatively cheap compared to U.S. equities. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF trades at 14 times earnings, and earnings are forecast to increase at 10% annually in the next few years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trades at 22 times earnings, which are forecast to increase at 9% annually in the next few years.\n\nThe last item of consequence is the expense ratio. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF carries a below-average expense ratio of 0.06%. That means shareholders will pay just $6 annually on every $10,000 invested in the fund.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF is a sensible way for investors to get exposure to stock markets across Europe. The index has handily outperformed the S&P 500 year to date, and I think that trend will persist through the end of the year, especially if the Trump administration's trade policy continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, even if I am incorrect about the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF outperforming the S&P 500, Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley says such investments are an \"inexpensive way to hedge portfolios against a potential U.S. stock market pullback.\" I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard International Equity Index Funds - Vanguard Ftse Europe ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard International Equity Index Funds - Vanguard Ftse Europe ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard International Equity Index Funds - Vanguard Ftse Europe ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The Trump administration has unnerved investors with its departure from traditional trade policy. The average tax on U.S. imports fell to 2.5% under the previous administration, but the tariffs Trump has imposed or plans to impose would raise that figure to 8.4%, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. That would be the highest level since 1946.\n\nFearing the impact of a trade war on the U.S. economy, investors have rotated away from domestic equities and into international stocks. The three major U.S. market indexes have declined year to date, including a 4% slide in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%). Meanwhile, several international indexes have generated robust returns, as detailed below:\n\nThe European STOXX Europe 50 index has advanced 8%.\n\nindex has advanced 8%. The British FTSE 100 index has advanced 4%.\n\nindex has advanced 4%. The French CAC 40 index has advanced 9%.\n\nindex has advanced 9%. The German DAX has advanced 15%.\n\nImportantly, the returns above are shown in local currencies. But the U.S. dollar index has fallen over 4% year to date, meaning U.S. currency has become less valuable versus a basket of foreign currencies. Consequently, the STOXX Europe 50 has advanced 13% year to date as measured in U.S. dollars.\n\nInvestors seeking international exposure should consider the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK 2.07%), the best-performing Vanguard index fund year to date. Read on to learn more.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF provides cheap and easy exposure to European stock markets\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF measures the performance of more than 1,200 European stocks. It is heavily weighted toward equities in the United Kingdom (24%), France (16%), and Germany (14%), the three largest economies in Europe.\n\nThe 10 largest holdings in the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF are listed by weight below:\n\nSAP: 2.4% ASML Holding: 2.3% Novo Nordisk: 2.1% Nestl\u00e9: 1.8% Roche Holding: 1.8% AstraZeneca: 1.7% Novartis: 1.7% HSBC Holdings: 1.5% Shell: 1.5% LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton: 1.5%\n\nAmerican stocks crushed European stocks in the last decade, but that trend has reversed course in 2025 due to uncertainty surrounding the health of the U.S. economy. Consumer sentiment in the U.S. has plummeted since December as the Trump administration has implemented tariffs on imports from several countries.\n\nConsequently, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF has returned 14% year to date, while the S&P 500 has declined 4%. And that outperformance could continue in the remaining months of the year due to discrepancies in economic growth, looser monetary policy, and cheaper stock market valuations.\n\nEuro area gross domestic product (GDP) growth is forecast to accelerate into 2027, while U.S. GDP growth is forecast to decelerate through 2026. Also, the European Central Bank has cut its benchmark rate by 185 basis points and has yet to pause. But the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate by only 100 basis points and has paused its cutting cycle.\n\nFinally, European equities are relatively cheap compared to U.S. equities. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF trades at 14 times earnings, and earnings are forecast to increase at 10% annually in the next few years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trades at 22 times earnings, which are forecast to increase at 9% annually in the next few years.\n\nThe last item of consequence is the expense ratio. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF carries a below-average expense ratio of 0.06%. That means shareholders will pay just $6 annually on every $10,000 invested in the fund.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF is a sensible way for investors to get exposure to stock markets across Europe. The index has handily outperformed the S&P 500 year to date, and I think that trend will persist through the end of the year, especially if the Trump administration's trade policy continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, even if I am incorrect about the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF outperforming the S&P 500, Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley says such investments are an \"inexpensive way to hedge portfolios against a potential U.S. stock market pullback.\" I agree wholeheartedly.",

The financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\n\n\n\nEmployees of HSBC Trust Company have joined the expanded Ludlow Trust group. The name of the firm has been changed to Ludlow Trust Company (Southampton) Ltd.\n\n\n\nMatthew Wickers, CEO of Ludlow Trust, said, \u201cThis latest opportunity underscores our commitment to growth and excellence in the UK trust market. We are pleased to welcome the talented staff and valued clients of HSBC Trust Company into the Ludlow group.\u201d\n\n\n\nJames Hewitson, CEO of HSBC Trust Company UK noted, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to have reached agreement with Ludlow Trust to acquire HSBC Trust Company, a move which will provide customers with stability and expert service for years to come. The decision reflects HSBC\u2019s strategic focus on simplifying the business. We will work closely with Ludlow Trust over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition for customers and colleagues.\u201d\n\nDetails of HSBC\u2019s Business Simplifying Effort\n\nHSBC announced the business simplifying plan in October 2024 and realigned its business segments as part of this effort. Further, in sync with its effort, the company announced the winding down of its investment banking activities in the U.K., Europe and the United States, and divestitures of its French life insurance arm, HSBC Assurances Vie (France) and private banking business in Germany. It also announced the sale of its business in South Africa.\n\n\n\nDriven by these restructuring initiatives, the company targets to achieve almost $1.5 billion of annualized savings by 2026-end. To implement the plan, HSBC will likely incur nearly $1.8 billion in total severance and other upfront charges by the end of next year. The bank also intends to reallocate an additional approximately $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas over the medium term.\n\n\n\nIn the past couple of years, HSBC has completed the sale of its businesses in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia, as well as the retail banking operations in France and Mauritius.\n\n\n\nDriven by these initiatives, HSBC was able to control expenses in the past. Nonetheless, costs are likely to remain high in the near term, given the company\u2019s focus on growing market share in the U.K. and Asia, as well as strengthening global digital capabilities. HSBC expects target-based operating expenses to increase 3% year over year in 2025.\n\n\n\nIn the past three months, shares of HSBC have rallied 14.2% on the NYSE, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 6.1%.\n\n",

The reduction was also in view of declines in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, News.Az reports, citing Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cOur revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,\u201d strategists including David Kostin and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday.\n\nA separate team led by Lilia Peytavin raised its Stoxx Europe 600 (^STOXX) earnings-per-share growth forecast to 4% for 2025 and 6% for 2026 and 2027. \u201cThis upgrade reflects a stronger medium-term economic growth outlook in the Euro area and tailwinds from a weaker Euro compared with our 2025 outlook,\u201d they wrote. Goldman joins a growing chorus of banks that have expressed concerns over economic growth amid heightening geopolitical uncertainties. Analysts at Citigroup Inc (C). and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBC) downgraded their views on US equities this week, citing similar worries around the economy and noted better opportunities elsewhere. Market forecasters at banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and RBC Capital Markets have also tempered bullish calls for 2025. President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade policies and the ongoing government job cuts have sent measures of consumer and business sentiment lower as recession fears mount. The uncertainty has pushed the S&P 500 gauge down by more than 9% from a high in February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) tumbled into correction last week. Goldman strategists trimmed their earnings growth forecast for the year to 7% from 9% and reduced their price-to-earnings ratio by 4%. Kostin was among analysts who were bullish on US stocks last year and has warned of growth risk to equities in recent weeks. They said investors should own stocks that are insulated from the major drivers of ongoing market volatility such as lender Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), financial information services provider S&P Global Inc. (SPGI), and rating agency Moody\u2019s Corp. (MCO) Market participants should also consider stocks hammered by the hedge fund positioning unwind that trade at discounted valuations such as software maker Informatica Inc.

It\u2019s not clear how many bankers are affected by the latest moves.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to supporting clients globally,\u201d a London-based spokesperson said in an email. \u201cHSBC is moving to a new, simpler structure as we continue to focus on products and geographies where we can have a clear competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nSix months into his new role, Elhedery has undertaken one of the most significant upheavals in more than a decade in a bid to focus on areas where the UK bank says it can best serve its corporate and institutional clients. He previously combined the commercial banking division with the global banking and markets unit.\n\nHSBC will incur US$1.8 billion in charges over the next two years as it embarks on the global restructuring programme that has seen the lender reduce management ranks. The company began informing select managers in its corporate advisory and equity underwriting teams in New York, London and continental Europe that it was shuttering their businesses in January, a move affecting hundreds of jobs. In February, it kicked off cuts in its investment bank starting in Asia and affecting employees globally.\n\nWith the wind down looming, some senior bankers are being forced to pay for team-building activities out of their own pockets due to the expenses curbs, the people said.\n\nHSBC is also examining its equities sales and research capabilities as part of a review of its Wall Street offerings, Elhedery said last month. It has made minor cuts to staff in its global markets unit, though that business has been left relatively untouched compared to the more radical steps Elhedery has taken in the bank\u2019s corporate advisory units.

Further, last year, the company acquired Citigroup\u2019s retail wealth management business in China and SilkRoad Property Partners Group in Singapore.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it re-launched its private banking business in India and obtained approval to open bank branches in 20 new cities, which are at the center of expanding its wealth and international business.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, HSBC acquired 100% of the issued share capital of AXA Insurance in Singapore and L&T Investment Management Limited. Further, the company secured multiple additional licenses to expand its operations in mainland China. These initiatives are likely to strengthen the company\u2019s position in Asia, which constitutes more than half of its operations.\n\n\n\nRestructuring Efforts to Boost Efficiency: HSBC has been engaged in restructuring efforts to enhance its operational efficiency. In October 2024, the company announced an initiative to streamline its organizational structure, which became effective from Jan. 1, 2025. Driven by this restructuring initiative, the company aims to achieve approximately $1.5 billion of annualized savings by 2026-end.\n\n\n\nThe company will likely incur nearly $1.8 billion in total severance and other upfront charges by the end of next year to execute business simplification efforts. It also plans to reallocate an additional approximately $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas over the medium term.\n\n\n\nIn sync with this, the company announced the winding down of its investment banking activities in the U.K., Europe and the United States, and divestitures of its French life insurance arm, HSBC Assurances Vie (France) and private banking business in Germany. Apart from these, HSBC completed the sale of its businesses in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia, as well as the retail banking operations in France and Mauritius. It also announced the planned sale of its business in South Africa.\n\n\n\nSolid Capital Position: HSBC has a strong capital position despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company\u2019s capital ratios were strong, driven by continued capital generation. Further, it has long-term investment grade ratings of A+, A3 and A- from Fitch, Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s, respectively.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of its robust capital position and lower debt-equity ratio relative to its peers, the company has been rewarding its shareholders consistently. In 2024, HSBC returned $26.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.\n\n\n\nThe company expects a dividend payout ratio of 50% for 2025. Further, it intends to initiate a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which will be completed by April 29, 2025.\n\n\n\nHSBC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Over the past six months, shares of the company have gained 28.6%, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 10.2%.",

            "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\n\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\n\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: HSBC (HSBC)\n\nHeadquartered in London, HSBC Holdings plc is a major global banking and financial services firm with $3.02 trillion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. Operating through a global network of various offices in nearly 60 countries and regions in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and North and Latin America, it provides a wide range of financial services.\n\nHSBC is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 8.37; value investors should take notice.\n\nOne analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $6.66 per share. HSBC boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.8%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, HSBC should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC)?\n\nBefore you invest in HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "Investors in HSBC Holdings plc (Symbol: HSBC) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2026 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 464 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HSBC options chain for the new June 2026 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of HSBC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.04/share today.\n\nBecause the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.20% return on the cash commitment, or 5.66% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for HSBC Holdings plc, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of HSBC stock at the current price level of $55.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.37% if the stock gets called away at the June 2026 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if HSBC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for HSBC Holdings plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing HSBC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.36% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.00% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 28%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.04) to be 21%.

            "content": "Some HSBC Holdings plc ( ) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Group CFO & Executive Director, Manveen Kaur, recently sold a substantial UK\u00a3810k worth of stock at a price of UK\u00a39.26 per share. However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 4.1%.\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At HSBC Holdings\n\nNotably, that recent sale by Manveen Kaur is the biggest insider sale of HSBC Holdings shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of UK\u00a38.76. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in HSBC Holdings than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of HSBC Holdings\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that HSBC Holdings insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about UK\u00a385m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At HSBC Holdings Tell Us?\n\nUnfortunately, there has been more insider selling of HSBC Holdings stock, than buying, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that HSBC Holdings is growing earnings. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd practice some caution before buying! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that HSBC Holdings has and it would be unwise to ignore them.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\n\nWalmart\u2019s emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\n\nHowever, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\nShares of HSBC have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past year (+68.4% vs. +25.6%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter results reflected lower expenses. A strong capital position, relatively high rates, global network and business simplification efforts will keep aiding its financials.\n\nAs part of its Asia pivot strategy, it is moving away from less profitable markets and announced the sale of businesses in Germany and South Africa. It has exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Greece, Russia, Argentina and Armenia.\n\nWhile efforts to strengthen its market share in the Asia region will support financials, they will likely lead to an increase in expenses. For 2025, the company expects operating expenses to increase 3%. The company\u2019s subdued revenue performance in light of weaker loan demand amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop is a woe.\n\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\n\nAdobe\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-19.4% vs. +1.4%). The company is facing intensifying competition from the likes of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is concerning. Lack of monetization is a headwind for Adobe amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nNevertheless, Adobe\u2019s prospects are expected to benefit from strong demand for its creative products. Its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products have been driving top-line growth. New AI releases, including Express, Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly Services, DX premium tiers and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, have expanded the portfolio of products.\n\nThese are expected to drive Adobe\u2019s market share and monetization in the near future. Adobe\u2019s deepening generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) focus and innovative GenAI-powered portfolio are key catalysts.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Adobe here >>>)\n\nShares of Friedman Industries have underperformed the Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry over the past year (-12.4% vs. +24.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $110.07 million is facing fiscal third-quarter sales declined 18.9% year over year. The tubular segment remains weak and high inventory levels pose risks amid steel price volatility. Rising costs and debt burdens could pressure profitability despite hedging strategies and operational efficiencies.\n\nNevertheless, Friedman Industries' sales backlog grew 11% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025, signaling stronger demand and potential revenue recovery. Post-election stability has driven increased order activity, with fiscal fourth-quarter sales and margin expansion expected as hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices rebound.\n\nDebt fell 9% to $32.5 million, with $99.2 million in available credit supporting operations. Industry tailwinds include a projected increase in HRC prices and rising infrastructure and manufacturing investments.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Friedman Industries here >>>)\n\nNetSol Technologies\u2019 shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-14.2% vs. +1.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $28.48 million have seen license fee revenues plummeted 97.6% year over year, and rising operating expenses ($7.41 million, +20.5%) pressured profitability. Net loss reached $1.15 million due to FX volatility, and revenue from key client Daimler fell 23%.\n\nTrade risks, competitive pressures, and uncertain ROI on growth investments remain concerns. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, NetSol is transitioning to a subscription-based model, enhancing revenue stability. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription and support revenues grew 27% year over year to $8.6 million (55.6% of total revenues).\n\nStrong customer relationships with BMW and Kubota drive long-term revenue visibility, while North American expansion diversifies income streams.

He is on a crusade to deregulate the economy, in particular the energy and oil sectors.\n\nThe divestment comes as Milei rips away controls on crude and fuel prices that were used to stem inflation. That was sometimes bad for refiners or drillers, depending on how the controls were engineered at different points in time. Domestic fuel prices now are aligned with the international market.",

            "content": "Inward investment opportunities between the UK and China were the focus of the second panel of the day at the UK-China Business Forum 2025 on 5 March\n\nChaired by Huang Shan, Director and Senior Fellow at Caixin Insight, the discussion featured insights from Joe Li, Head of China Desk at HSBC; Yang Ming, CEO of Westwell Holdings; Natasha Luther-Jones, Global Head of Energy and Global Resources Sector at DLA Piper; and John Dykes, Sales Director for Ming Yang Smart Energy. The panel explored how the UK can attract Chinese investment, the role of policy and infrastructure, and the synergies between the two economies in sectors like green energy and advanced manufacturing.\n\nHuang Shan opened the discussion by referencing UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s commitment to cutting bureaucracy and creating a stable investment environment. \u201cStarmer has emphasised the need to rip up red tape and ensure stability to attract investment,\u201d she said. This sentiment was echoed by Joe Li, who noted the improving ties between the UK and Chinese governments. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the adults back in the room. The relationship is now being handled in a sensible and pragmatic way,\u201d Li remarked. He highlighted HSBC\u2019s unique position as a British bank with deep roots in China, symbolised by its name, which includes two Chinese cities. \u201cWe are at the core of this conversation, and we\u2019ve already seen a significant increase in enquiries from Chinese investors,\u201d he added.\n\nLi also shared HSBC\u2019s efforts to bridge the gap between UK SMEs and Chinese markets. \u201cLast year, we took 20 SMEs on a week-long trip to China, and this year we plan to take 40 clients on a two-week trip. The interest is growing rapidly,\u201d he said. However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by the UK\u2019s regulatory environment, particularly in sectors like green energy. \u201cWhen you have 4,000 documents required for planning permission, it\u2019s hard for Chinese investors to understand. Grid reform is another major obstacle, with 700 megawatts of power projects pending due to outdated assessment processes,\u201d Li explained. He welcomed recent efforts to prioritise \u201cready-to-go\u201d projects, calling it a positive cultural shift.\n\nYang Ming, CEO of AI company Westwell Holdings, made his first public appearance in the UK at the forum, expressing optimism about the UK market. \u201cThe UK is a great market, with its ports, supply chains and growing demand for smarter, greener solutions,\u201d he said. Westwell\u2019s AI-powered autonomous trucks have been operational at Felixstowe, the UK\u2019s largest port, for two years, improving efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. \u201cOur focus is not just on what we do but on driving industrial change. The UK\u2019s world-leading educational institutions and innovation hubs, like our partnership with a centre in Hong Kong, are key to this,\u201d Yang added.\n\nNatasha Luther-Jones provided a legal perspective on inward investment, particularly in the energy sector. She highlighted the National Security and Investment Act as a key concern for Chinese investors. \u201cEnergy is one of 17 sectors affected by the act, so each case needs to be assessed individually,\u201d she said. Luther-Jones advised companies to make voluntary notifications to avoid delays, noting that only five out of 150 cases had been called in for review, with none being blocked outright. She also emphasised the importance of planning consents, local workforce considerations, and the potential for change-of-control issues. \u201cGrid reform, expected in the first half of this year, will be a game-changer. It will prioritise projects that are ready to go, addressing the backlog of \u2018zombie projects\u2019 that have grid connections but lack land rights or funding,\u201d she explained.\n\nLuther-Jones also touched on the geopolitical dynamics shaping the energy sector. \u201cEuropean OEMs are struggling to meet demand, and Chinese manufacturers like Ming Yang are stepping in. For example, a German fund recently chose Chinese turbines over European ones because they were the only ones meeting the required specifications,\u201d she said. She predicted that the UK and Europe would increasingly rely on Chinese manufacturers to meet net-zero targets, particularly in wind and battery storage. \u201cThe difficulty with net zero will be in heat, not power. We\u2019ve seen this shift with solar, and now we\u2019ll see it with wind and storage,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn Dykes, representing Ming Yang Smart Energy (MYSE), outlined the company\u2019s strategy for aligning with the UK\u2019s growth goals. \u201cWe focus on technology adaptation, innovation, and market integration,\u201d he said. MYSE\u2019s European R&D centre collaborates with top institutions to develop next-generation turbines and smart grid technologies. \u201cOur aim is to meet UK and EU standards while contributing to net-zero goals,\u201d Dykes explained. He highlighted the booming global demand for clean energy as a tailwind for MYSE, driven by sectors such as data centres and electric vehicles. \u201cPolicy incentives and technological innovation are key growth drivers. For example, our twin-rotor turbines maximise efficiency, and we\u2019re now selling them globally, with plans to expand further west,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Dykes also acknowledged the headwinds facing the industry. \u201cInflation in raw materials like aluminium, copper, and resin has created significant challenges. Contracts signed years ago at outdated prices can lead to heavy losses,\u201d he said. Regulatory compliance and the need to build trust with local suppliers were additional hurdles. \u201cFor a Chinese OEM, engaging local suppliers is crucial. It\u2019s not just about investment; it\u2019s about creating relationships and upskilling the workforce,\u201d Dykes added.\n\nThe panel concluded with a consensus on the immense potential for UK-China collaboration, particularly in green energy and advanced manufacturing. Huang Shan summarised the discussion by emphasising the importance of stability, policy clarity, and cultural understanding. \u201cThe UK offers a wealth of opportunities, but to fully capitalise on them, we need to address regulatory barriers and build trust. Chinese investors are looking for long-term partnerships, and the UK has the expertise and infrastructure to make these partnerships successful,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the forum demonstrated, the UK and China are at a pivotal moment in their economic relationship. With the right policies, infrastructure, and collaboration, the two nations can unlock significant mutual benefits, driving innovation and sustainability in an increasingly interconnected world.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- HSBC Holdings Plc promoted David Sabow to lead the global expansion of its venture-banking business, after he led that team in the US and more than doubled headcount there in the past two years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSabow, based in San Francisco, was named global head of HSBC Innovation Banking, a division that provides deposit accounts, loans and other services to startups and venture-capital funds. He reports to Gerry Keefe, head of banking for Europe and Americas.\n\nSabow joined HSBC in April 2023, when the company scaled up its venture-banking business. He was previously at Silicon Valley Bank, which failed earlier that year during the regional-banking crisis. He was one of about 40 US bankers hired by HSBC after the British lender acquired the UK subsidiary of SVB and brought in roughly 700 bankers.\n\n\u201cWe have ambitions for this to be a multibillion-dollar business,\u201d Sabow said in an interview, adding that its competitive edge includes a broad range of products as well as a global reach and financing capabilities backed by the balance sheet of the UK\u2019s largest bank.\n\nGlobally, the innovation-banking unit generated $700 million in revenue last year.\n\nIn addition to the US, Sabow now has accountability for venture-banking operations in the UK, Europe, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong, China and Singapore, and will work closely with the local leaders. The innovation-banking business in the UK remains a standalone entity led by the unit\u2019s chief executive officer, Emily Turner.\n\n\u201cI always just expected that international needs occurred much later in a company\u2019s life cycle,\u201d Sabow said, adding that he\u2019s now seeing that even companies early in their funding rounds can have far-flung operations in places like India and Eastern Europe.\n\nEven as tariff wars and geopolitical conflicts risk shaking up the premise of globalization, Sabow said international commerce is \u201can all-weather phenomenon.\u201d\n\nHSBC can leverage the diversity of its business lines and geographical footprint to hedge against isolated events, he said. While tariffs will add friction to trade in certain markets, companies may start looking for partners in other markets, where HSBC also has a presence.\n\nHSBC has been expanding its venture-banking business even as it shrinks some of its other operations. The bank is in the middle of a restructuring of its investment-banking business to cut costs.",

He retired last month, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn\u2019t public.\n\nHSBC is one of just four clearing members whose vaults underpin tens of billions of dollars a day in trades in the London gold market \u2014 along with JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS Group AG and ICBC Standard Bank Plc.\n\nThe lender says little publicly about its precious metals business. Yet its scale was laid bare in 2020, when HSBC revealed a mark-to-market loss of around $200 million in one day thanks to an extreme price dislocation between London and New York, caused by the pandemic. However, the divergence soon became an opportunity for banks such as HSBC as they shipped bullion to the US to capture the price premium \u2014 a dynamic that\u2019s been repeated in recent months.\n\nVoller has been a board director of the London Bullion Market Association since 2019. He once penned a letter defending London\u2019s over-the-counter gold market as offering \u201cunmatched flexibility.\u201d\n\nHe has not been replaced, but the precious metals division continues to be overseen by Richard Anthony, HSBC\u2019s head of FX eRisk & Commodities, one of the people said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

For further details on his insights, click here.\n\nAccording to Wong, such a mechanism could potentially meet the increasing demand from mainland investors eager to delve into global assets. The initiative would provide significant benefits to Hong Kong by attracting overseas firms to list in the region, thereby enhancing capital market dynamics and expanding business prospects. Hong Kong's strategic use of the 'one country, two systems' framework is perceived as a critical leverage point in facilitating the liberalisation of China's financial sector.\n\nCurrent connect schemes, initiated in 2014 to link the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets and expanded to include Shenzhen in 2016, already allow mainland investors to buy Hong Kong stocks and vice versa. These programmes later grew to cover bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), wealth-management products, and swaps.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against other best holding company stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Treasury Yield Market\n\nThe treasury yield has been moving towards its lowest point in a month following a comment from the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson. The secretary suggested that the new administration is focused on the 10-year treasury and its yield, rather than the Fed cutting interest rates. On February 6, Ed Mills, Managing Director at Raymond James, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on the market amid new economic, political, and tax policies.\n\nMills reiterated a very important factor raised in the Secretary\u2019s speech the day before, suggesting that the Trump tax cuts from 2017 were to be made permanent, adding $4 trillion to debt and deficit over the coming 10 years. He added that the policies also desire to cut tips and social security taxes, now bringing the total debt and deficit to $5 trillion. Mills suggested that the debt and deficit were so huge that it would be extremely challenging for the government to keep the \u201clong end of the curve down.\u201d\n\nWhy Value Investing is the Way to Go\n\nIn another interview on March 5 on Yahoo Finance, Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman at TIGER 21, shared his market thesis amid changing macroeconomic and political trends. He shared that while turmoil and confusion are encapsulating the market, his clients remain very strong, emphasizing his inclination towards value investing. He also added that his members are finding significant value in private equity and the private real estate industry.\n\nHe suggested that while a lot of indicators in the market point towards a possible rotation from growth into value, he remains cautious about the changing conditions, reiterating that it is currently very challenging to find value in the market environment. Sonnenfeldt added that focusing on the fundamentals of equities is of crucial importance at the moment, rather than company momentum, amid volatile economic and political conditions. He shed light on his member\u2019s buying strategy, which happens to be entirely focused on the basics of a stock, emphasizing that others should follow suit.\n\nWhile some stocks pose a risk due to the current market conditions, some stocks, especially those with strong fundamentals and long-standing businesses, offer greater protection and certainty.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now, we went over similar rankings on the internet and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment around every stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.",

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HSBC options chain for the new April 25th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $59.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $59.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of HSBC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.96/share today.\n\nBecause the $59.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.85% return on the cash commitment, or 6.19% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for HSBC Holdings plc, and highlighting in green where the $59.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example above is 32%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $59.96) to be 21%.

The bank said the $4-million award is \u201cin recognition of the leadership required to integrate HSBC Bank Canada and realize the full value potential of the acquisition.\u201d\n\nThe bank closed its acquisition of HSBC Canada in April, clinching a rare opportunity to take over one of the largest lenders in the country. Britain-based HSBC Holdings PLC put its Canadian subsidiary on the auction block after deciding to leave the market and reallocate resources to regions where it expects greater opportunities to grow its business.\n\nThe deal initially attracted interest from Canada\u2019s Big Six banks. As Canada\u2019s seventh-largest lender, HSBC Canada was the most significant takeover opportunity since the Canadian government made it more difficult to complete bank acquisitions more than two decades ago.\n\nMore than half of HSBC Canada\u2019s retail and commercial clients have global banking needs, which means the acquisition moves RBC into products and services that it has not offered before, including multicurrency accounts that allow customers to save money in foreign currencies and trade on international exchanges.\n\nRBC said the jump in Mr. McKay\u2019s bonus came in part because the bank posted 2024 adjusted net income of $16.6-billion, compared with a goal of $15.9-billion. These figures do not include profit and costs from integrating HSBC Canada in its businesses.\n\nEvery element of Mr. McKay\u2019s compensation rose in the most recent year. His salary increased to $1.92-million from $1.50-million in the year prior. RBC granted him stock options valued at $2.37-million, up from $2.20-million the year before.\n\nRBC said Mr. McKay\u2019s pay of $25.97-million reflects \u201cfinancial and strategic strength across its global footprint,\u201d which it said resulted in record earnings and the bank\u2019s stock outperforming peers over the past three and five years. RBC also cited \u201cthe depth of Mr. McKay\u2019s leadership and extraordinary efforts in creating long-term value for RBC\u2019s clients, employees, communities where we operate, and shareholders.\u201d\n\nMr. McKay made $16.13-million in fiscal 2023.\n\nPay for other executives also rose significantly, but more modestly than Mr. McKay\u2019s.\n\nDerek Neldner, the bank\u2019s head of capital markets, received $11.71-million, up from $10.51-million in 2023.\n\nDouglas Guzman, RBC\u2019s deputy chair, made $9.23-million, up from $7.56-million the year before.\n\nNeil McLaughlin, head of RBC\u2019s wealth management division, made $8.17-million, up from $7.21-million in 2023.\n\nNew chief financial officer Katherine Gibson made $4.37-million in her first year in the role. She replaced Nadine Ahn, who was terminated by RBC in April when the bank alleged she had an undisclosed personal relationship with a colleague.\n\nMs. Ahn, now CFO at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., is suing RBC for wrongful termination, and RBC is countersuing to claw back compensation and bonus pay. RBC reported her fiscal 2024 pay was $312,603 and said in a footnote that \u201cas of the date of this circular, the final determination of amounts to be paid relating to Ms. Ahn\u2019s termination (if any) remain unresolved.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been updated to correct minor rounding errors in the statement of Dave Mackay's 2023 stock options and Neil McLaughlin's 2024 pay.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Treasury Yield Market\n\nThe treasury yield has been moving towards its lowest point in a month following a comment from the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson. The secretary suggested that the new administration is focused on the 10-year treasury and its yield, rather than the Fed cutting interest rates. On February 6, Ed Mills, Managing Director at Raymond James, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on the market amid new economic, political, and tax policies.\n\nMills reiterated a very important factor raised in the Secretary\u2019s speech the day before, suggesting that the Trump tax cuts from 2017 were to be made permanent, adding $4 trillion to debt and deficit over the coming 10 years. He added that the policies also desire to cut tips and social security taxes, now bringing the total debt and deficit to $5 trillion. Mills suggested that the debt and deficit were so huge that it would be extremely challenging for the government to keep the \u201clong end of the curve down.\u201d\n\nWhy Value Investing is the Way to Go\n\nIn another interview on March 5 on Yahoo Finance, Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman at TIGER 21, shared his market thesis amid changing macroeconomic and political trends. He shared that while turmoil and confusion are encapsulating the market, his clients remain very strong, emphasizing his inclination towards value investing. He also added that his members are finding significant value in private equity and the private real estate industry.\n\nHe suggested that while a lot of indicators in the market point towards a possible rotation from growth into value, he remains cautious about the changing conditions, reiterating that it is currently very challenging to find value in the market environment. Sonnenfeldt added that focusing on the fundamentals of equities is of crucial importance at the moment, rather than company momentum, amid volatile economic and political conditions. He shed light on his member\u2019s buying strategy, which happens to be entirely focused on the basics of a stock, emphasizing that others should follow suit.\n\nWhile some stocks pose a risk due to the current market conditions, some stocks, especially those with strong fundamentals and long-standing businesses, offer greater protection and certainty. That said, let\u2019s take a look at the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now, we went over similar rankings on the internet and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment around every stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n14 Best Holding Company Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n14. HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) is a financial services company that ranks 14th on our list of the best holding company stocks to buy right now.

As of September 30, 2024, HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) had almost $3.1 billion in assets. In an impressive feat, the company received 33 prizes in the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2024.\n\nOn February 5, Nick Lord, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, maintained a buy rating on HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) with a price target of HK$84.60. The analyst gave a buy rating based on the company\u2019s recent financial statements and upward revisions to its revenue estimates. In addition to that, the forecast for fees and other income for the fiscal years 2025 and 2026 has been revised, explaining investors\u2019 shared optimism in the stock. On the flip side, estimates for costs have been revised downwards, pointing to operational efficiencies and increased profitability. Lord also eyes strong shareholder returns in the future years, emphasizing his buy rating on the stock.\n\n13. American International Group, Inc.

More fiscal stimulus would help to offset the hit from weaker exports, he said.\n\n\u201cBut are you going to pull out the so called policy bazooka and go all out and by next year you\u2019re exhausted because you spent all your early policy ammunition? Probably not,\u201d Neumann said on Bloomberg Television on Tuesday.\n\nIn another move ramping up geo-political risks, Trump has paused all pending military assistance to Ukraine, increasing worries about Kyiv\u2019s ability to continue resisting Russian aggression. Ukrainian dollar bonds extended losses, although notes with longer maturities later reversed the decline. The MSCI EM equity benchmark pared some of its early losses, staying 0.3% lower mainly due to a drop in shares of chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nNews.Az",

            "content": "Last year, shares of healthcare company CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) crashed by more than 43%. The company struggled with rising medical costs and routinely missed earnings expectations. It also got a new CEO. Investors had many reasons to remain doubtful about its future.\n\nBut recently, the company posted strong earnings numbers that actually came in better than expected. Under new leadership, CVS appears to be doing better already. Is this just a short-term surprise for investors, or could it truly be a sign that the business is in better shape? And could it lead to more of a rally in the weeks and months ahead?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nCVS stock has risen by 40% already this year\n\nThrough the first two months of 2025, investors have been much more bullish on the healthcare stock than they were last year. Entering trading on Tuesday, CVS Health was up 40%, significantly better than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gain of just 2% over that stretch. A big catalyst was the company's latest earnings report, which came out on Feb. 12; the stock jumped 15% that day due to the results.\n\nIt was a solid start under new CEO David Joyner, who took over in October, in an effort to turn things around. Not only did revenue of $97.7 billion beat expectations of $97.2 billion, but quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 also blasted past expectations of $0.93. Given all the bad news and negative press for CVS (there's even been discussion about a possible breakup of the company), it was a much-needed positive event for the stock, giving it some life.\n\nBut are investors getting ahead of themselves?\n\nWhy CVS may not have smooth sailing\n\nBeating expectations is great news, but that doesn't mean CVS is out of trouble. The company's medical benefits ratio (MBR) came in at 94.8% compared to 88.5% in the prior-year period. The MBR tells investors how much of the premiums the healthcare provider collects it spends on medical care; the higher the ratio, the worse its margins are. The company says increased utilization and a decline in its star ratings for Medicare Advantage were the key reasons for the worsening ratio.\n\nAnother concern is that all three of the company's main operating units -- healthcare benefits, health services, and pharmacy and consumer wellness -- reported adjusting operating income numbers for the quarter that were worse than they were a year ago.\n\nWhile CVS did technically beat expectations, analysts may simply not have been expecting too much from the business, given all the uncertainty. Amid all the question marks and poor track record in recent quarters, it may simply be difficult to forecast how CVS will actually do.\n\nShould investors hold off on buying CVS Health stock?\n\nCVS Health stock has been a hot buy to start 2025, but it's far too early to say that the company has turned things around, or that it's a much safer buy than it was last year. Its MBR is extremely high, and the business still doesn't look in terribly great shape. While it may seem like a cheap buy, trading at around 11 times its expected future earnings, that's based on analyst expectations.\n\nThere's still some risk with the stock, and it can be a volatile investment. While an earnings beat jump-started its share price recently, the reverse can easily happen if it falls short of expectations next quarter. If you're willing to be patient and hang on for multiple years, this can still be a good stock to hang on to. But you should brace for a bumpy ride as CVS hasn't turned things around just yet, and doing so may take awhile.\n\nThe safer option may be to wait for a couple of quarters to see if the MBR comes down. If it does, that could provide some confirmation that the business is moving in the right direction.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CVS Health right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CVS Health, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CVS Health wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see HSBC Holdings plc ( ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is two business days before a company's record date in most cases, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase HSBC Holdings' shares on or after the 6th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 25th of April.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.36 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.66 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, HSBC Holdings has a trailing yield of 5.6% on the current stock price of UK\u00a39.336. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether HSBC Holdings's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. HSBC Holdings is paying out an acceptable 53% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.\n\nGenerally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.\n\nClick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see HSBC Holdings's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 34% per annum for the past five years.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, nine years ago, HSBC Holdings has lifted its dividend by approximately 2.9% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because HSBC Holdings is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nShould investors buy HSBC Holdings for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share are growing nicely, and HSBC Holdings is paying out a percentage of its earnings that is around the average for dividend-paying stocks. Overall, HSBC Holdings looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in HSBC Holdings for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it. Discover if HSBC Holdings might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.

            "content": "A representational image of gold bars. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nFor centuries, gold has been the go-to haven asset in times of political and economic uncertainty. The fact that it\u2019s tangible -- something you can hold in your hand -- gives people a sense of safety and represents a store of value when everything else is in turmoil.\n\nInvestors have sought refuge in bullion amid mounting concerns over US President Donald Trump\u2019s disruptive trade and geopolitical agendas. The price of gold has hit a series of record highs in 2025, extending a ferocious run from last year.\n\nUS prices have surged even higher, building a premium over international benchmarks, on fears that gold could imminently be included in Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported goods. Precious metals have yet to be targeted specifically but dealers are worried they could be swept up in the broad levies Trump has announced and threatened. This has spurred a transatlantic gold rush as the yellow metal is moved from vaults in London to New York.\n\nWhy is gold being sent from London to New York?\n\nUnder normal circumstances, bullion prices in New York and London -- two key trading hubs -- move in near lockstep. But gold futures on New York\u2019s Comex have been trading significantly above spot prices in London, with the gap topping $50 per troy ounce this year.\n\nThe huge price differential has created a lucrative arbitrage opportunity for dealers, traders and investors. There\u2019s been a worldwide dash among those in possession of the physical metal to shift it to the US to capture the large premium and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.\n\nAs of mid-February, Comex inventories had swelled by more than 20 million ounces -- worth about $60 billion -- since the US election in November. Much of the gold that was express shipped to New York came from London.\n\nThe last time there was such a severe price dislocation was in 2020, when the Covid-19 lockdowns upended the gold market and led to bumper profits for those who were able to charter planes and deliver the metal to the US.\n\nWhy is so much gold stored in London?\n\nLondon is the world\u2019s largest trading hub for physical bullion and was sitting on more than 8,500 metric tons as of January, according to data from the London Bullion Market Association.\n\nThe city sees gold change hands in commercial vaults run by dealers such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc. The Bank of England also holds a large stash in nine heavily fortified vaults and keeps these deposits on behalf of the UK Treasury, other central banks and commercial banks. The BOE is often considered the last resort to tap for the physical market -- holders there rarely shift their bullion as it\u2019s a relatively cheaper storage option and has long proven its security.\n\nHowever, because of the urgency to get ahead of any Trump tariffs that may hit the yellow metal, both the commercial vaults and Bank of England\u2019s cache have been drawn upon. The BOE saw its biggest gold outflows since 2012 in January.\n\nIs there a risk London will run out of gold?\n\nDespite the exodus, there\u2019s still plenty of bullion deep below Threadneedle Street -- the Bank of England is the second-largest custodian of gold in the world after the New York Federal Reserve and holds around 420,000 bars.\n\nWhile its stocks haven\u2019t been depleted, the BOE has struggled to keep up with the pace of demand, resulting in a weekslong queue to make withdrawals and even a discount to spot gold prices in London. The bank operates with a limited number of vault staff and the bullion is split across two subterranean floors, making it cumbersome to move. To top things off, holders don\u2019t have the right to just any bar in the Bank of England; instead they own specific bars that must be tracked down and brought to the surface.\n\nThese logistical complications are a risk for those wanting to move their gold to the US and capture the large price premium before a potential tariff squeeze.\n\nHow easy is it to transport gold internationally?\n\nIt\u2019s usually relatively simple to shift, stashed away in the cargo holds of commercial aircraft, unbeknown to the holiday and business travellers in the cabin above. There\u2019s a limit on how much can be transported on one flight, not because of the weight, but because of the value, as insurers will only cover a certain amount on any one plane.\n\nYet, it\u2019s not as straightforward as loading up a jet from Heathrow Airport to JFK thanks to a quirk in the global gold market: different size requirements. In London, 400-ounce bars are the standard, while for Comex contracts, traders must deliver 100-ounce or 1-kilogram bars. That means bullion being sent to Comex warehouses has to first go to refiners in Switzerland to be melted down and recast to the correct dimensions, before journeying on to the US. This creates a bottleneck when there\u2019s a particular rush to rejig the location of bullion stocks. The wait time at refineries has been getting longer due to the high demand for their services.\n\nIs it just trade war fears pushing up the gold price?\n\nThe metal\u2019s blistering price rally since the start of 2024 was partly driven by huge purchases by central banks, particularly in emerging markets as they seek to reduce their dependency on the US dollar, the world\u2019s primary reserve currency. Gold helps diversify a country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and guard against currency depreciation.\n\nCentral banks\u2019 appetite for gold has been building since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine underscored how foreign currency assets are vulnerable to sanctions -- the US and its allies froze the funds of the Russian central bank held in their countries. In 2024, central banks bought more than 1,000 tonnes of bullion for the third year in a row, according to the World Gold Council, and they hold around a fifth of all the gold that\u2019s ever been mined. Their sustained enthusiasm spurred Goldman Sachs Group Inc to raise its year-end target for the gold price to $3,100 per ounce in mid-February.\n\nIs gold the only precious metal being snapped up?\n\nTraders have also put silver, gold\u2019s cheaper sister, on commercial flights to the US to capitalise on a lucrative premium. Silver bars are normally considered too bulky and low in value to be worth the cost of transporting them by plane; instead they\u2019re typically shipped by boat and it takes around a month to 45 days to reach their destination. But the New York price premium has made air freight viable.\n\nMany market participants and industry experts don\u2019t expect silver to be included in Trump\u2019s tariffs, but the transatlantic arbitrage opportunity is being driven by lingering uncertainty. As with gold, there\u2019s a lack of clarity over what will ultimately face the import duties Trump has dangled, including the delayed 25 per cent tariffs announced on goods from Mexico and Canada, two of the top suppliers of silver to the US.",

That's like the equivalent of three CommBanks acquiring ANZ.\n\nSo you might be wondering, could this happen here? Australian banks are generally very safe, with a few safeguards in place, as detailed below:\n\nCommon Equity Tier Ratio (CET1) Ratio\n\nThis is basically a requirement of banks to hold capital of at least 4.5% as a percentage of assets on its books. Many of the top Aussie banks far exceed this. For example:\n\nCET1 ratio (to risk weighted assets) as of September 30 2024 CommBank 11.8% Westpac 12.69% NAB 12.35% ANZ 12.2% Macquarie Bank 12.8% Bendigo Bank 11.32% Bank of Queensland (BOQ) 10.66%\n\nAPRA $250,000 guarantee\n\nAustralia's prudential regulator guarantees all deposits in Australia up to $250,000 per account, per bank.\n\nThis was established by the Rudd Government in 2008 amid the GFC, and was initially guaranteed up to $1 million, before reverting to $250,000 in 2012.\n\nPrior to this, state governments had various deposit insurance policies over the years.\n\nThe regulatory environment was a lot different in decades past, and regulation differed slightly depending on if you had money parked at a bank, a building society, or credit union. Now they are all basically one-and-the-same, with APRA's $250,000 guarantee applying uniformly and nationally.\n\nAPRA's federal scheme is called the ADI (authorised deposit-taking institution) guarantee, which forms part of the wider Financial Claims Scheme, explained in further detail here.\n\nBasically, this means that if you deposit $250,000 with CBA, and in the hugely unlikely event it folds, you'll be able to get all your money back.\n\nThe guarantee applies per licence. Be aware that some banks share licences, for example UBank and NAB.\n\nIt also applies per account holder, meaning if you share an account with your partner, you're guaranteed $250,000 each.\n\nIt also applies to internationally-owned banks with products in Australia, such as the Dutch-owned ING, and the UK-owned HSBC.\n\nThis isn't just for you, either; it is good for the bank in that it prevents consumers from getting spooked and pulling all their money out when a slight scare happens, called a bank run.\n\nThis alone creates security in banking in Australia; beyond that, banks in Australia are generally required to have stronger liquidity ratios, and tend to have healthy counter-cyclical capital buffers (CCYB).\n\n\u201cWe are the only jurisdiction in the world that mandates banks carry capital to address the risk of rising interest rates as part of their core capital requirements,\" Mr Lonsdale said.\n\n\"The significance of this measure in light of current events is hard to overstate.\"\n\nBank collapses in Australia\n\nBank collapses are incredibly rare in Australia.\n\nIn contrast, US regulators estimate there have been 563 bank failures from 2001 through 2023 in the land of the free and home of the brave.\n\nHowever it depends on how you define it; for this exercise, we'll define it as when an institution requires central bank or government intervention to ensure deposit-holders aren't overly affected.\n\nMore recently, a couple of neobanks created some headlines. In early 2021, Xinja folded, handed back its banking licence, and returned all customer deposits.\n\nIn mid-2022 Volt Bank did the same. Under the criteria, both aren't considered collapses as they returned all customer deposits, didn't trigger the $250k guarantee, and didn't require central bank intervention.\n\nIn the GFC, CommBank acquired Bankwest, while Westpac acquired RAMS and St George. However these weren't strictly due to liquidity problems, and aren't considered collapses.\n\n1. The 1990s\n\nYou have to go back to 1990 when the case could be made for a bank collapse.\n\nThat year, the Farrow Corporation - parent company of the Pyramid Building Society - collapsed. A run on bank deposits caused it, and it's estimated it cost Victorians $900 million at the time; the Victorian Government introduced a fuel levy to repay deposit holders.\n\n2. The 1970s\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s, a few banks and building societies required central bank lines of credit, which were drawn down and later repaid.\n\nA number of banks and building societies also required lines of credit and capital injection from state governments, but again, these are not out-and-out collapses.\n\nInstitutions included St George Permanent, and the Bank of Adelaide.\n\n3. The Great Depression\n\nBefore that you have to go back to 1931 to see when a proper bank collapse happened, which required the intervention of the Commonwealth Bank - then Australia's central bank.\n\nIn 1931, NSW's and WA's state-owned banks were acquired by CBA.\n\nThe Primary Producers Bank accepted a loan but declined further support and collapsed; and the Federal Deposit Bank had support denied by CBA.\n\nThe argument for banking with major banks\n\nThe decision on which bank to park your cash, or take out a loan with really depends on your own situation and what you value. If you are looking for easy access to your money through ATMs and value the opportunity to visit a local branch and chat with a staff member, a bigger bank might be what you\u2019re after.\n\nAccess to your money - Although digital banking is now used more than cash, banking with the big four will mean easier access to ATMs for withdrawing and depositing cash.\n\nVisit a local branch - The bigger banks offer the most active branches to get assistance with your banking. Many smaller banks have entirely online services, meaning you can\u2019t visit a branch in your area or speak to a staff member for help with your banking.\n\nCustomer service - Whether in Australia or overseas, you\u2019ll likely have access to customer service with a major bank. Many smaller banks have no dedicated customer service phone number or in person services.\n\nA holistic banking experience - Many major banks can be your one-stop shop for everything from banking, insurance, financial advice, share trading, asset management and more. Smaller banks might not be able to compete with this level of in-depth service.\n\nThe argument for banking with a smaller bank\n\nIf you are more focused on earning interest on a savings account or term deposit, then smaller banks may offer a better rate as they have to be competitive to attract customers. Similarly, if you\u2019re looking for a local banking experience that gives back to the community, credit unions or customer-owned banks are typically more prolific with these initiatives.\n\nBetter deals - Due to the popularity of the big four, smaller banks will often offer better rates on savings accounts, and home loan products in an effort to attract customers. Shopping around can often save you money by finding a great deal with a smaller financial institution.\n\nLower fees - Smaller banks reduce their overhead by digitising their customer service and other services. These cuts often filter through to their customers. The bigger banks have branches all over the country, with huge numbers of staff, this means higher costs which can lead to higher fees for their customers.\n\nFaster turnaround times - Major banks often have a lot going on, and may take longer to process your home loan application. Smaller banks may pride themselves on faster turnaround times enabling you to get approved for products sooner.\n\nApps - While the big four banks have pretty swish apps, smaller banks such as neobanks pride themselves on their user experience. In these apps you\u2019ll often find money management tools, unique insights and other slick capabilities that other banks' apps may not have developed.\n\nThe big four banks are 'big' - but why? A recent history\n\nThese banks must abide by what\u2019s called the \u2018four pillars policy\u2019. This policy essentially bans these four banks from ever merging. They are also incredibly large banks.\n\nIt's also important to note APRA data encompasses major banks' subsidiaries with CBA owning Bankwest; Westpac, BankSA, Bank of Melbourne, St George and RAMS; and NAB, UBank and Citi. This is why you won't see these individual brands in the data.\n\nA lot of the majors' assets are tied up in home lending. The latest data indicates the big four banks make up around 75% of the value of residential home lending in Australia among banks, or nearly $1.6 trillion. They also have a strong presence in New Zealand.\n\nCBA has been firmly entrenched as Australia's largest bank - by pretty much any measurement - for decades, after a legacy of being wholly owned by the Federal Government, and acting as central bank until the RBA was established in 1960.\n\nWestpac firmly holds the two-spot in terms of assets, but not always by market cap as seen in the above statistics.\n\nANZ is the smallest of the majors, but is still very large in the grand scheme of things. That said, in 2022 Suncorp agreed to spin off its banking arm, and ANZ and Suncorp Bank agreed to merge in a deal worth around $5 billion. ANZ said the acquisition would enable it to compete better with the other major banks.\n\nThe ANZ-Suncorp Bank romance sees the major bank's assets grow to more than $800 billion, and become the third-largest bank in terms of home loans.\n\nAfter the ACCC initially blocked the proposal, the Australian Competition Tribunal heard the appeal and approved the merger in February 2024. It was then approved by Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers in June 2024.\n\nThese assets have had the 'Suncorp' branding stripped, and are now trading as Norfina Limited until the acquisition by ANZ is complete. It should see it come close to beating NAB in the rankings.\n\nMacquarie Bank - making the \u2018big four\u2019 the \u2018big five\u2019?\n\nMacquarie Bank Limited (MQG) has risen to become one of the largest banks in Australia, and in terms of market cap, it\u2019s up there with the major banks.\n\nIn late 2021, Macquarie Group Limited (MQG) hit a market cap of $77.5 billion according to Bloomberg, making it bigger in this regard than ANZ and Westpac at the time.\n\nSince that time it has sometimes jostled with ANZ to claim the crown as Australia's fourth-largest bank, at least in terms of market cap.\n\nIt did so again at the end of January 2025.\n\nThis potentially makes Australia\u2019s banking landscape dominated by \u2018the big five\u2019, however Macquarie is not subject to the four pillars policy. Macquarie also has less of a retail banking presence than the other major banks as you'll see below.\n\nMacquarie sources a lot of its revenue from its investment banking arm, and through international ventures and asset management, rather than through savings accounts, term deposits, home loans, credit cards, and other loans.\n\nADI Stats Sourced From: APRA Monthly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Statistics - January 2025\n\nMarket Cap Figures Sourced From: ASX",

With a P/E ratio of 13.39, this earnings fumble may be an opportunity for new investors to add this energy stock to their portfolio at a reduced rate.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"Not Just China: 3 European Stocks Gaining Investor Interest\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

            "content": "(Feb 27): The new head of sustainability at HSBC Holdings plc says the time has come for banks to stop penalising clients that have a large carbon footprint.\n\nJulian Wentzel, who was appointed as the chief sustainability officer at Europe\u2019s largest bank this month, said an overly restrictive policy towards fossil fuels puts at risk the reliable supply of energy, and may even undermine the transition to a low-carbon future.\n\n\u201cToo many people have been negatively biased towards the carbon economy, without acknowledging that the carbon economy plays a very important role from an energy security perspective,\u201d Wentzel said in an interview.\n\nThe comments show how the concept of climate finance is evolving. Less than half a decade ago, HSBC and its peers in Europe, the US and Asia signed up to net zero emissions goals that obliged them to align their portfolios with a scenario of 1.5\u00b0C of global warming. But as scientists warn that the world is now on track for roughly 3\u00b0C by the end of the century, banks and investors have started challenging a number of net zero assumptions.\n\nTo accelerate the transition to a future in which economic growth requires a much smaller carbon footprint, policymakers and the private sector need to figure out how to ratchet up spending on low-carbon activities, and worry less about restricting capital flows to fossil fuels, Wentzel said.\n\n\u201cA lot of focus has been on how does one constrain or constrict the carbon economy rather than on how one can grow or facilitate the new world energy economy,\u201d said Wentzel. \u201cIf the world spent more time focusing on that side of the equation, I think the transition will happen faster and capital will flow more easily.\u201d\n\nFor now, banks aren\u2019t close to the four-to-one ratio of green-to-brown capital allocations that BloombergNEF (BNEF) says is needed if the industry is to align its business with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. At the end of 2023, the industry\u2019s so-called energy-supply banking ratio, which includes debt and equity underwriting, was 0.89 to 1, BNEF said in January. HSBC performed better than the industry average, with a ratio of 1.49, BNEF estimated.\n\nMeanwhile, banks\u2019 fossil-fuel clients are facing intense investor pressure to double down on their core strategies. On Wednesday, BP plc announced a major pivot that will see the UK oil major step up focus on its fossil-fuel business while cutting investment in renewable energy. The changes are intended to appeal to disgruntled shareholders, which include activist Elliott Investment Management.\n\nBP will now increase investment into oil and gas to about US$10 billion (RM44.42 billion) a year, and reduce annual investment into low-carbon energy to US$1.5 billion to US$2 billion, about US$5 billion lower than its previous guidance.\n\nAs oil companies dig in their heels, banks have been increasingly vocal in calling out what they characterise as a fixation on restrictive fossil-fuel policies. Back in 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co said that \u201ca singular focus on fossil fuels won\u2019t successfully achieve the necessary transition of the global energy system\u201d. Instead, the largest US bank said the focus should be on \u201csupporting the rapid build-out of zero-carbon power\u201d, which in turn would \u201chelp replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions\u201d.\n\nLast week, HSBC walked back some of its earlier emissions goals, a move it said was necessary because of the slow pace of decarbonisation in the wider economy. Implicit in HSBC\u2019s decision was an acknowledgement that both politics and physics are working against existing climate goals.\n\nAnd as the Trump administration takes a wrecking ball to pro-climate policies, scientists say it is now a virtual certainty that the world has missed its chance to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n\u201cWe live in a dynamic world, and we have to reflect the environment and the world we live in,\u201d said Wentzel, who was previously the head of global banking for the Middle East, North Africa, and T\u00fcrkiye at HSBC. \u201cI can\u2019t ignore the political weather.\u201d\n\nNet zero is fast losing support in key corners of global finance. In North America, the biggest banks have all pulled out of the industry\u2019s largest net zero alliance. And the US government under Donald Trump has made clear it will seek to stamp out policies friendly to net zero, with US Energy Secretary Chris Wright going so far as to dub the concept \u201csinister\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\nWentzel said HSBC remains committed to reaching net zero financed emissions by 2050, and aligning itself with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, even though the scenario is looking increasingly challenging.\n\n\u201cWe have always said that we would be science-aligned, and there is absolutely a scientific basis to being 1.5\u00b0C-aligned,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, what we are starting to see is the challenge in the global economy and the environment as a whole that the anchor is going to be harder and harder to achieve.\u201d",

            "content": "HSBC UK's analysis reveals that high earners often have ambitious financial goals, but just under half (44%) of those with financial goals feel they are on track to achieve them. This drops significantly to only one in five (21%) of the general population. Despite not feeling on track to meet their goals, most people are optimistic about their financial futures, with 95% of high earners and 85% of the general population believing that their financial goals are achievable.\n\nPerceptions of wealth don't just differ across income level. The report reveals that there are also distinct regional differences both in wealth and the way it is perceived. Londoners surveyed said that it takes more than \u00a3289,000 to be wealthy on average. Meanwhile, those in the Northeast say it's an average of \u00a380,000.\n\nDespite being in the top 4%, high earners position themselves in the top 52% relative to the rest of the UK population, just above average [2] . This highlights a significant disconnect between perceived and actual financial position and hinting to how many high earners self-identify as the 'squeezed middle'. This is despite HSBC UK Premier customers having five times more savings and three times more money coming in and out compared to most HSBC UK customers.\n\nThis perception gap is largest amongst higher earners. Despite being in the top 4% of UK earners, only one in 10 people earning \u00a3100,000 or more would describe themselves as 'wealthy', while only 1% of the UK population identify as such. High earners also place the threshold for wealth much higher, citing \u00a3724,000 as the income it takes to be considered wealthy.\n\nThe report, which analyses the UK wealth landscape, reveals a wide wealth perception gap, with people underestimating their earnings relative to others by roughly 30 percentage points, on average.\n\nLONDON, Feb. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- People in the UK believe an average annual income of \u00a3213,000 constitutes wealth, over six times the national average salary [1] - according to HSBC UK's new insight report, ' Your Money's Worth: Defining Wealth in 2025' , with the top 4% of earners often setting a much higher bar and underestimating their comparative affluence.\n\nThe new insight comes as HSBC UK unveils its new Premier proposition for high earners across the UK, offering new benefits across wealth, international, travel and health\n\nThat's despite nine in 10 high earners (those earning over \u00a3100,000 a year) saying they do not consider themselves as wealthy\n\nA new report from HSBC UK uncovers a wealth perception gap, revealing that an annual income of \u00a3213,000 is what it takes to be considered 'wealthy' today\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen it comes to financial ambitions among high earners, almost half (48%) are aiming for a comfortable retirement, home ownership (30%), or want to make significant home improvements (20%). But the need to prioritise more immediate costs (27%), insufficient savings (11%), and unpredictable income (14%) remain challenging, even for this more affluent group.\n\nCredit plays an important part in helping higher earners manage their day-to-day finances. HSBC UK customer data shows that Premier customers are nearly twice as likely than most HSBC customers to also hold a HSBC UK credit card, although maximizing points and benefits will be a key driver of this trend. Meanwhile, one in 10 HSBC Premier-qualified customers are using their overdrafts regularly, compared to one in six general population customers.\n\nVicky Reynal, Financial Psychotherapist, said: \"HSBC UK's findings reveal a paradox: despite having high earnings and ambitious financial goals, many mass affluent individuals still don't feel wealthy. This disconnect underscores the psychology behind people's perceptions of wealth.\n\n\"Anxieties about rising costs, inadequate savings, and the pressure of social comparison create a sense of scarcity, even when objective wealth exists. By redefining wealth beyond the bank balance, focusing on our achievements, reducing unhelpful comparisons, and prioritising financial actions within our control, people can move confidently toward the future they aspire to.\"\n\nInvestments key indicator of wealth for more than half of Brits\n\nHSBC UK also explores diverse attitudes towards signifiers of wealth. While over half (51%) of the general population identifies owning a private jet or a yacht (48%) as the main signifier of wealth, high earners are more likely to consider non-material factors \u2013 such as retiring early (48%), frequently travelling abroad (45%) or having investments (54%) - as more relevant symbols.\n\nInvestments have emerged as critical markers of wealth across the board, with 49% of the general population seeing this as a key signifier of wealth. While the majority (55%) of those earning over \u00a3100K have investments, this figure drops dramatically to just 18% of the general population.\n\nAlmost half (49%) of Gen Z (18\u201324-year-olds) consider wealth in non-material terms, compared to one third (35%) of those aged 35-44. When it comes to high earning 18\u201324-year-olds[i], one third believe that having a strong work-life balance is a strong signifier of wealth, and 41% are aspiring to this in the next two years.\n\nAmong the nationally representative sample, this generation is also likely to be proactive and open about their finances, with nearly half of 18\u201324-year-olds saying they like talking about money compared to just 3% of over 55s. This proactivity is reflected in their investment behaviour, with nearly half (43%) of high earners in this group[ii] already having an investment portfolio, and less than one in five (17%) of those in the nationally representative sample are aspiring to do so.\n\nXian Chan, Head of Premier Wealth, HSBC UK said: \"Wealth is a deeply personal concept, that is dependent not only on people's objective financial position but also on how they feel about money.\n\n\"People often evaluate their sense of wealth in relation to how financially secure they feel, and how close they are to being able to achieve their financial goals. But the key for everyone is in early preparation. Investments remain the most significant signifier of wealth, and adding to those gradually over the long-term is a crucial step for building towards prosperity. Starting to save even a small amount regularly, and as early as possible, while developing regular habits, is one of the most important things that we can do to plan successfully for our financial futures.\n\n\"At HSBC UK, we're committed to working with our customers to help them define wealth for themselves, take control of their futures, and start building towards their aspirations \u2013 whether they're already on their wealth journey, or just starting out.\"\n\nHSBC UK's latest report reveals a shift to a more holistic view of wealth among high earners. The bank's new, enhanced Premier offer features tailored benefits across health, wealth, international and travel. From comprehensive healthcare cover to lounge access and personalised wealth management, the new Premier offer caters to high earners looking to build and grow their wealth, whatever their ambitions may be.\n\n[1] Source: ONS\n\n[2] Source: ONS\n\n[i] N.B.

            "content": "Hong Kong has ambitions to establish itself as one of the world\u2019s leading digital hubs.\n\nWe see this digital hub ambition as a positive development for Hong Kong to future-proof its position as an international finance centre and also diversify its economy to create new opportunities for growth.\n\nHaving the right people with the right skills is a key building block for success in any venture, but in particular for cutting-edge innovation where there may not be well-trodden paths ahead.\n\nIf Hong Kong wants to achieve its digital ambitions, it must be selective and forward-looking in attracting and nurturing the right talent.\n\nHong Kong heritage\n\nHSBC has a very long heritage here, and an important role now in helping Hong Kong move towards that vision in an audacious and sustainable manner.\n\nThe bank is collaborating with government officials, regulators, entrepreneurs, innovation and technology hubs, and experts in academia, and taking part in joint working groups with the likes of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).\n\nThe aim is to promote technological transformation in the world of finance, with the projects we\u2019ve been involved with ranging from digital assets and AI to fintech ecosystems.\n\nEmbracing transformation\n\nWhen it comes to digital transformation, change needs to flow from the top. A strong ownership and accountability model is pivotal to the structure to get results.\n\nHSBC has embraced transformation, and that makes all the difference. Our senior leadership team has consistently supported innovation and experimentation, with a view to fostering a culture which looks to the future.\n\nThis can be found in initiatives that include idea-sharing platforms, in-house competitions, recognition programs, and dedicated think tanks, which experiment with emerging technologies in separate, controlled environments.\n\nThis helps to attract, nurture and retain a broad range of tech talent from seasoned technical domain experts to emerging talent.\n\nThe secret sauce is a mix of individuals who bring experience, technical expertise, creativity and unique perspectives, working in an environment that fosters an innovation culture.\n\nStrategic partnerships\n\nAnother way to build skills and expertise is through partnerships.\n\nHSBC\u2019s strategic partnership with HKUST\u2019s School of Business and Management aims to accelerate the bank\u2019s digital journey by connecting academic research to industry practice.\n\nThrough this partnership, researchers and professors from HKUST work on use cases together with subject matter experts from the bank.\n\nLast year, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and HSBC entered into a three-year strategic partnership agreement to drive innovation and create a more effective bank-fintech collaboration ecosystem.\n\nUpskilling workforces\n\nWith technology advancing at what seems like lightning speed, companies should continuously upskill their workforces by investing in training to ensure that employees have the know-how to implement and work with new technologies. This also helps to get everyone on board with all the changes.\n\nIntroducing any disruptive and transformative technology has to be a gradual process as it is integrated into the everyday business.\n\nThere will be a number of challenges, but that is the nature of change. Having the right talent on board is the key to success.\n\nA version of this article was first published in HKUST Business School Magazine (opens in new window) (opens in new window).",

For your information, this call is being recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to George Elhedery, Group CEO.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Welcome, all, to today\u2019s call. I\u2019m joined by Pam, our new Group CFO. We\u2019re delighted to be here in Hong Kong, the city where HSBC was founded 160 years ago. Our history and heritage stand us in good stead in so many ways. Adapting to new economic realities and technologies is what we have always done. It brings out the best in our people and culture, especially when acting as a trusted advisor to our customers as they navigate the world\u2019s economic uncertainties and look towards new opportunities. Before Pam takes you through the fourth quarter numbers, I will cover four items. First, I will go through our full-year 2024 results. Second, I will set out the changes implemented over the past few months to create a simple, more agile, focused bank addressing the ways we operate in a fundamental way.\n\nThird, I will describe in some detail the solid foundations we are building on. And finally, I will share with you what we plan to do next in order to deliver sustainable strategic growth and meet our return targets. Starting with the full-year numbers, 2024 performance was strong. We delivered record profit before tax of $32.3 billion, or $34.1 billion excluding notable items. We generated a 14.6% return on tangible equity, or 16% excluding notable items, in line with our mid-teens target. We announced a total of $26.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders in respect of 2024, including $0.87 per share of dividends and $11 billion of share buybacks. When I took the role in September, my priority was to inject energy and intent in the way we deliver our strategy, while maintaining continued focused cost discipline.\n\nAt our third-quarter results, I committed to provide you with more detail on the expected benefits from our organizational simplification. We have simplified HSBC in two important ways. We have elevated and empowered our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK and our Wealth proposition, and we have combined our two wholesale businesses. In doing so, we have eliminated large parts of our complex matrix governance structure. This significantly improved operating model is now led by a tighter Group Operating Committee. It has clarity of accountability, fewer management lines and layers, reducing the need for the number of committees we previously ran across the bank. This has increased our agility. As an illustration, previously, every dollar of revenue we generated had at least two accountable executives at the Group Executive Committee.\n\nToday, around 60% of our revenue has a single accountable executive at the Group Operating Committee. This will empower our people to make faster decisions, collaborate better and innovate for the benefit of our customers. In short, we\u2019ve simplified our structure and we\u2019ve aligned it to our strategy. This will enable us to deliver around $1.5 billion of annualized savings by the end of full-year 2025, primarily through deduplication of roles. This represents circa 8% reduction of our global staffing costs. This will cost around $1.8 billion in severance and other up-front costs. Those $1.5 billion savings will have no meaningful impact on revenue and they will be taken straight to the bottom line. Separately, we will redeploy circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities as incremental investments to our priority growth areas, where we have clear competitive advantages and generate accretive returns.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Hsbc Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC) Follow Hsbc Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nWe have started to do this by announcing that we will begin to wind down our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, Europe and the U.S. I will cover our priority growth areas shortly. These actions give us the confidence to target a mid-teens return on tangible equity in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Each of our four businesses are firmly rooted in our core strengths. In our two home markets of Hong Kong and the UK, we have two strong businesses. In both businesses, we serve Personal Banking customers as well as Commercial Banking and Small and Medium Enterprises. We are a leading bank and are growing market share in key products. Importantly, in both, we are profitable and delivering very good returns. As for the large corporations with global banking needs in both home markets, alongside individuals with multi-country personal financial needs, they will be served by our two international businesses, as I am about to set out.\n\nCorporate and Institutional Banking, CIB, is a global wholesale bank with significant competitive advantages. It has a powerful deposit franchise with strong financing capabilities, and it also has a market-leading transaction bank, leveraging our global network. As the world\u2019s number one trade bank for the last seven consecutive years, we are exceptionally well placed to help our customers and capture global and intra-regional trade flows as supply chains reconfigure, new trade routes emerge, economies grow, and our customer expectations evolve. CIB is also well positioned to help entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to build the businesses of the future and help our customers decarbonize. International Wealth and Premier Banking, IWPB, is ideally placed to capture the increasing number of affluent and high-net-worth customers, especially those with international banking needs who seek new investment opportunities to help them protect and grow their wealth.\n\nOur recognized brand, financial strength and complementary footprints across Asia and the Middle East reinforce our position in the world\u2019s fastest growing wealth markets. Let me now highlight our distinctive strengths, starting with our high-quality revenue streams. Our franchise generates resilient recurring revenue from three key sources. As you can see, in 2024, two-thirds of revenue was from Banking NII. This is the result of the strong deposit and lending positions in each of our four core businesses. As you know, we have built up the structural hedge to protect this revenue stream from falling interest rates. Pam will speak more about this. The remaining third was from fee and other income. Around a half of this was from our market-leading Wholesale Transaction Banking business, which is built on our global network, covering 85% of global trade and capital flows, including high-growth markets such as India, ASEAN, of course mainland China, the Middle East and Mexico.\n\nAround a third was from Wealth, which I will talk about shortly. Taken together, this means that more than 90% of our revenue comes from three high-quality streams. Moving to our strong deposit franchise, our customers trust the strength of our balance sheet and have chosen us to look after their deposits. This gives us a highly liquid and profitable balance sheet, which provides greater flexibility through the cycle. Within our $1.7 trillion deposit base, we have large deposit surpluses in each of our four businesses, giving us the funding capacity to support our clients. Turning now to our high-quality loan portfolio, we have always maintained a conservative approach to risk management, as evidenced by the quality of our loan portfolio. In the period since 2018, we have experienced a global pandemic, an energy crisis and the real-estate cycle in the U.S., in Hong Kong and in mainland China.\n\nOur average annual ECL charge over that period was 32 basis points of average gross loans, which is well within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. On our disciplined capital management, over the last two years, our capital generation has enabled us to return $47.7 billion to our shareholders. This comprises of $27.7 billion of dividends and $20 billion of share buybacks, including those announced today. Through the rolling series of share buybacks we have undertaken since the start of 2023, we have now repurchased 11% of our year-end 2022 issued share count. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. The external environment presents us with opportunities but also challenges.\n\nThe interest rate outlook is benign but it remains volatile. We can adapt to changing patterns of trade and economic growth, but there is a risk of disruption, and we have a major opportunity in wealth in Asia and the Middle East, but it is a highly competitive space. Despite these challenges, we have levers we can pull on to support us to deliver on our target. We\u2019re confident we can take decisive action to do so. These levers are, first, driving operating leverage as an ongoing process through cost efficiency and optimization, as well as continuous improvements in productivity, second, dynamic balance sheet management and capital allocation, which I\u2019ll cover shortly, and third, investing for strategic long-term growth. Let me turn to this next.\n\nWe\u2019re creating the capacity to invest for growth in the business and to drive efficiencies. We\u2019re focusing our growing investment pot, as shown on this and the next slide. First, in our home markets, we intend to expand the number of wealth centers and enhance our wealth capabilities in Hong Kong, which is set to become the world\u2019s leading cross-border wealth center. We attracted around 800,000 new-to-bank personal banking customers in Hong Kong last year, and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as international customers choose Hong Kong as their cross-border wealth hub. In the UK, we plan to also grow the Wealth business, and we plan to improve our SME coverage and proposition. This is an extremely attractive and profitable segment, where we will intensify our focus.\n\nSecond, in CIB, we intend to leverage our network and further enhance our transaction banking capabilities, including in high-growth markets such as Mainland China, ASEAN, India, Middle East and Mexico. We are also looking to scale up our broad loan origination capabilities by underwriting more and distributing more to our institutional and wealth clients. This ability to leverage our loan origination for the purpose of distribution will give us larger opportunities to generate fee income, improve capital efficiencies and, in turn, improve CIB returns. Third, in IWPB, we intend to accelerate the wealth build-up in our home markets, and particularly also in key growth markets such as Singapore, the UAE, India and Mainland China. In each of these, we aim to accelerate the hiring of relationship managers, establish new wealth centers, and expand our product offering.\n\nWhile we are benefiting from an underlying growth in this segment, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, we also aim to grow our market share by, first, better driving wealth penetration with our own wholesale or Premier customers, second, better capturing cross-border flows of our own customers in their outbound location, and third, increasing the proportion of mandates within our invested assets. Finally, underpinning all of this and across the Group, we aim to seize the opportunity of AI and generative AI. Our flagship initiatives will focus on improving customer service through both our mobile apps and our contact centers. We also intend to increase tech productivity with tools such as coding assistants, and improve process efficiency in areas such as onboarding, KYC, credit applications and many others.\n\nMid-teens returns will give us a range of attractive options for capital deployment and will drive EPS and DPS growth over time. As the illustration on the right-hand side of the slide demonstrates, a mid-teens return on tangible equity will enable us to deliver the 50% dividend payout ratio in 2025, and still have sufficient capital to grow the balance sheet, buy back shares, or both. Supporting our customers will always be our first priority, and we expect our loan book to grow in the mid-single digits over the medium- to long-term. However, fluctuations in customer demand for credit mean our loan book may grow at an uneven pace. Share buybacks remain our preferred method of returning excess capital to our shareholders, because they drive growth in EPS and DPS.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, while our earnings grew by circa 2%, our earnings per share grew by circa 9%, reflecting the benefit from the circa 6% reduction of share count through share buybacks in this year. So in summary, we\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we\u2019re eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We are targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027.\n\nWith that, let me hand over to Pam.\n\nPam Kaur: Thanks, Georges. Thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by sharing my approach as Group CFO. In short, I\u2019m fully focused on discipline, performance and delivery. Discipline means prioritizing with precision, maintaining strong cost control, and ensuring investment rigor for growth. Performance means gearing our financial strategy towards achieving our mid-teens returns target. Delivery means ensuring we remain agile and resilient, enhance operating leverage, and are always well positioned to support our customers. Let me now turn to the Q4 numbers. Starting with the highlights, profit before tax was $2.3 billion, or $7.3 billion excluding notable items. This strong performance enabled us to announce a further $8.4 billion of distributions in respect of the fourth quarter.\n\nThis consists of a fourth interim dividend of 36 cents per share, and a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we intend to complete before our first-quarter results in April. On this slide, you can see the impact of notable items on year-on-year revenue and profit growth. This was principally the $5.2 billion related to historical foreign exchange translation losses from the Argentina disposal. Excluding these, profit before tax was up 10% on the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue of $16.5 billion was up $1.2 billion on the fourth quarter of last year, driven by Banking NII and a strong performance in Wealth. On Banking NII, excluding the impact of Argentina and other notable items, the Banking NII run rate remained broadly stable.\n\nDeposit growth and benefits from the structural hedge were partially offset by lower interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect Banking NII of around $42 billion in 2025. To be clear, this is a change to the way we have given you guidance before. \u2018Around $42 billion\u2019 is not an underpin. It is our expectation at the present time, based on the current market rates outlook and our own projections. We also want to give you some additional detail on the structural hedge. As you know, we have been building up the structural hedge to help manage our interest rate sensitivity. During 2024, we increased the notional balance by around $50 billion. We also extended the duration from 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This contributed to a further reduction in the interest rate sensitivity of our Banking NII last year.\n\nWe have reduced our sensitivity to a 100-basis-point rate shock from around $7 billion in June 2022 to around $2.9 billion at the end of 2024. We\u2019re also providing additional disclosures on the expected reinvestment profile of the structural hedge. We expect to reinvest around $95 billion of assets in each of 2025 and 2026, from a current average yield of around 2.8%. We also expect to reinvest around $90 billion of assets in 2027, from a current average yield of around 3.4%. Moving to fee and other income, Wholesale Transaction Banking was stable on last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of strategic transactions, primarily the sale of Canada, it was up by 3%, as we continue to leverage our global network and capitalize on our position as the world\u2019s number one trade bank.\n\nThe standout performance was again in Wealth, which was up 27% on the same quarter last year. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth. I\u2019m pleased we added 234,000 new-to-bank Personal Banking customers in Hong Kong in the quarter. This brings the total number added in 2024 to 799,000, as Hong Kong continues to grow in importance as a cross-border wealth hub. I\u2019m also pleased with the strong momentum in the business in January, which is in line with previous years. All of this gives us confidence that we can continue to grow this business further. Our medium-term target is to continue to grow fee and other income by double-digit CAGR. There are three trends that underpin this ambition. First, the multi-year growth in new-to-bank customers in Hong Kong underlines that the city is on track to becoming the number one cross-border wealth hub before the end of this decade.\n\nOur past experience suggests that new customers grow their total balances and wealth products over time, so this is expected to provide a tailwind. Second, the strength of our business in key international wealth hubs, particularly Hong Kong, has enabled us to grow invested assets in Asia at 17% CAGR. This was also the key driver of our 13% CAGR growth in invested assets at the Group level. There have also been strong multi-year inflows of net new invested assets, with Asia accounting for the majority. Finally, our CSM balance is a third bigger than it was two years ago, despite the reclassification of our French life insurance business in the fourth quarter. This reflects continued year-on-year growth in new business CSM from higher volumes, particularly in Hong Kong.\n\nAs you know, the CSM balance is a store of future earnings, which released into the P&L at between 9% and 10% in the last two years. All things being equal, this means that future earnings growth has been built in. Also, last year the value of new business CSM was substantially greater than the CSM released to the P&L. On credit, our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion. $1 billion of this was in wholesale, including around $300 million from two clients, one in the UK and one in Mainland China commercial real estate sector. Overall, our portfolios in our home markets remained strong. This brought our 2024 charge to 36 basis points of average loans, which is within our medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. We expect our 2025 charge to be within our medium-term planning range.\n\nOn costs, we are committed to deliver $1.5 billion of simplification savings from our reorganization to the bottom line, of which around $0.3 billion will be recognized in our 2025 P&L. We expect to incur around $1.8 billion of severance and other up-front costs by the end of 2026. The bulk of these costs will be incurred this year. Separately, we are also aiming to reallocate a further around $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic activities to priority growth areas. You will have seen that we have announced that we will begin to wind down our ECM and M&A activities in the UK, Europe and the US while refocusing on Asia. Those businesses were not materially profitable and exiting them will make around $300 million of costs available for reinvestment in our priority growth areas.\n\nThe slide also shows some businesses that we have recently agreed to dispose of, German Private Banking and French life insurance, to which I\u2019ll add the sale of our retail banking operations in Bahrain, which was announced today. These were not aligned with our four businesses where we will focus our investment dollars and our time. Through these actions, we are creating investment space in our priority areas within our strict cost discipline. As Georges said, these include Wealth in Asia and the Middle East, UK SME coverage and wholesale transaction banking. Entry to the extra investment list is a high hurdle requiring strategic alignment and financial returns. As we continue to work through exits of low return and non-strategic activities, we are confident the investment dollars they provide will deliver a higher return to the bank.\n\nThe actions taken last year mean that 2024 costs were in line with our guidance of around 5% growth on a target basis. We remain fully committed to cost discipline. We expect 2025 costs to grow by around 3% compared with 2024 on a target basis, which excludes notable items and the direct costs of the Canada and Argentina disposals. Our guidance of around 3% growth includes up to 4% underlying growth from inflation and investment, partly offset by around $0.3 billion of efficiency cost savings that we expect to realize this year. On loans and deposits, loan balances were stable. Deposits were up 3% in the fourth quarter. This included an increase in Hong Kong supported by customer growth as well as seasonality. As we have said before, I would caution you against annualising that number.\n\nOur CET1 ratio was 14.9%, above our target range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect the buyback of up to $2 billion announced today to have an impact of around 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. We have reclassified our $7 billion legacy French home loan portfolio as hold to collect and sell in the first quarter. This will lead to recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1. In summary, we have set out our current expectations in respect of 2025 and the medium term, but our key target is mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of the next three years. We will run the bank to deliver this. Neil, can we go to Q&A please?\n\nA \u2013 Neil Sankoff: Thanks, Pam. We\u2019ll go to Q&A now. We\u2019ll start with questions from the room. Okay. I will start with you, Gurpreet. And please just wait for the microphone and remember to say your name and the name of your firm. Thank you.\n\nGurpreet Sahi: Thank you. Gurpreet Sahi from Goldman Sachs. If I can have two, please, the first is on CIB. Thank you for the 14% trailing RoTE. So with the cost saves, et cetera, where do we expect the CIB RoTE to trend over the next couple of years and how would the management think about incremental capital allocation in that business division? I know that interest rates are having an impact. So implied question is \u2013 let\u2019s say interest rates were a lot lower and payments, cash management, et cetera, earn us less. And then the second one is on International Wealth and Premier Banking. Thanks, again, for the 16% RoTE. So how should we think about incremental technology or new apps or kind of gaining market share in the cross-border area as it relates to International Wealth, given that the RoTE is not so high?\n\nSo how would be for example, Zing and those kinds of apps, where we were looking at competing with the fintech, how competitive would we want to be? Thank you so much.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Gurpreet. I will handle the two questions. On CIB, we haven\u2019t given specific returns medium-term returns for CIB. As Pam said, we\u2019ve given the bank-wide target of mid-teens return on tangible equity for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We haven\u2019t given a business-specific, but let me give you some indications of how we\u2019re looking at the business. First, this business will benefit from the largest of the reorganization-related cost saves because this business is the result of the merger of two wholesale businesses and, as per any merger, you would expect a lot of cost synergies in areas where we had duplicative activities, be it mostly back-office activities that are duplicative where we will achieve the savings.\n\nThis business also will benefit from additional we call it also the investment space from additional capital allocation efficiencies. We will be looking for more originate and distribute model. We will be looking to churn the balance sheet more, sweat the balance sheet more, drive higher earnings and fee income from this balance sheet and create better efficiency in the capital, and therefore we have a number of activities that will support this business\u2019s return on tangible equity performance. And remember also this business is a leading business in wholesale transaction banking. We\u2019re the largest trade bank in the world for seven consecutive years. We\u2019re a top-two bank in payments and a top-two bank in foreign exchange. We\u2019re the largest bank in securities services across Asia and the Middle East, so we\u2019re benefiting from an amazing transaction banking capability.\n\nWe\u2019re also benefiting from an amazing deposit franchise. As you\u2019ve seen, this business is in the 50s percent loan-to-deposit ratio, and that is a highly stable and highly profitable proposition. So a lot of investment in this business is to support this direction of travel. I didn\u2019t mention the activities such as debt capital markets, et cetera, which also remain core in the wider capital solutions we provide to our customers. On your second question about IWPB, I think you have to look at this business as one of the largest growth engines of this firm. I mean, starting with Hong Kong, Hong Kong is on track to become the world\u2019s largest cross-border wealth hub, ahead of Switzerland, by the end of this decade. We\u2019re talking a few years.\n\n800,000 new-to-bank customers, and we see this trend continuing. Then you look at various other parts of our network. Singapore is a major financial hub. The UAE has become a major wealth hub. We are the leading international wealth provider in mainland China and in India. So we continue to invest in these areas, and that investment will come in all forms, like more relationship managers, more wealth centers, more products on the shelf, more technology capabilities, and therefore, you have to expect that a lot of investment will go to this business, but this business is exhibiting already double-digit growth. I mean this business, Wealth in particular, has grown more than 20% year-on-year, and if you look at Asia alone our Wealth business in 2024 has grown more than 30% year-on-year, and therefore it deserves a lot of investment, even if that means we will eat a little bit on our return growth because we want to really secure our future as a leading provider, and our brand in parts of the world, such as Asia and the Middle East, is frankly second to none in our capability to attract this.\n\nCross-border is a very important area for us. Frankly, we have to punch at our weight. We\u2019re punching below our weight in cross-border. Our customers are with us in a given location, and then we lose them as their wealth or part of their wealth moves to another location. By just setting the right referral mechanisms, the product capabilities cross-border, the internal incentives, there is so much we can capture. It\u2019s our own customers. So the reach is fairly easy. It\u2019s a self-help mechanism that we\u2019re trying to just recover on. As for Zing, so Zing was a fantastic technology platform which we built and were rolling out to non-clients that we were building from scratch and built a few tens of thousands. What we did is we flipped it over its head, and we\u2019re bringing in the technology platform right in the core proposition.\n\nAs we roll this technology platform within our core proposition in the UK, 15 million clients will be able to benefit from it practically straight away, and we shouldn\u2019t be preventing that. That, on the contrary, accelerates our acquisition of international customers. And then, as we start thinking, rolling these new technologies widely in our Wealth business, there\u2019s a lot of potential we can get there. And that is a much faster gain than trying to build it from scratch in an area where we have non-customers working with a different brand than our very strong brand, HSBC. Thank you, Gurpreet.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Let\u2019s take a couple from the Zoom, and then we\u2019ll come back with Kunpeng and Jeremy. We\u2019ll take our first question from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. [Operator Instructions] Please, so we can get to as many of you as possible, please limit yourselves to two questions each. Thank you.\n\nKian Abouhossein: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is related to the $1.5 billion reallocation of costs. I just wanted to understand a bit if you could talk around the revenues associated, the capital and the risk-weighted assets, so we get a bit of an idea of the optimization of this capital? And secondly, also what the return on investment on this that you expect? You mentioned a high hurdle rate. And then the second question is more general to you, Georges. I mean, you are a CIB guy; you think about curveball issues all the time, spillover effects. So I\u2019m quite interested about how you are planning for tariffs within the Group, and in particular how you\u2019re thinking about the curveballs, not the direct impacts, but the indirect impacts that are impacting you from CRE to Wealth growth, et cetera, FX, and how you\u2019re basically putting that in your planning on your outlook and sensitivities around that? Thanks.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kian. Okay. I\u2019ll take the two questions, but if there are more details, additional granularity on CRE, I\u2019m sure Pam can handle that, but I\u2019ll just give you a general sense. So on your first question, $1.5 billion reallocation of costs, so what we did say is we would reallocate it from non-strategic or low-returning activities into activities where we have a competitive edge, where we have better returns, and where we have opportunities to grow. So you have to look at this as returns incremental. Just as an illustration, the wind-down of our M&A and ECM activities in the UK, U.S. and Europe will give us $300 million of saves as we achieve them, that we can redeploy elsewhere. This cost was generating broadly break-even profits, so we\u2019re marginally profitable in these activities.\n\nWe do expect these to give us a much higher return as they\u2019re reinvested, and we haven\u2019t quantified that, but the expectation is that there\u2019s an accretion of return. Second, if you look at the areas we\u2019re looking to invest in, wealth, transaction banking, as big callouts, they are actually none or low balance sheet-consuming businesses. They\u2019re materially fee and other income-driving businesses, with low, if any, impact on RWA growth. And if you look at the SME business, this business is essentially liability-driven and transaction banking- driven. The loans portion of this business is relatively small. The loan to deposit ratio is in the low-teens percentage points, which means, again, it\u2019s a low RWA impact, high in Banking NII from deposits or transaction banking, but low RWA impact.\n\nIn terms of your CIB curveball question, look, tariffs are not a new feature of global trade. There has always been various forms of tariffs on various products along various corridors, and we\u2019ve always navigated those with our clients and supported them along the route. I think what\u2019s changed now is maybe the speed at which the landscape will be evolving, the speed at which we may see new tariffs or changes in tariffs. But with the bank present on 85% of the trade corridors, with our global network, with our deep knowledge in all the markets where we operate, deep understanding of local rules and regulations, deep understanding of global rules and regulations, we\u2019re actually very well placed to support our customers adjust and position their businesses to navigate these tariffs.\n\nNow, I add to that also, remember, most of the jurisdictions we operate in have pro-growth government policies. The UK is a good example, pro-growth government policy; the US is a very good example;. mainland China, pro-growth initiatives, consumer support initiatives. You look at Hong Kong, the removal of the cooling off measures on the commercial real estate or real estate in general. These measures have been effective, and we\u2019re seeing the benefits in the economy and economic growth. So, there are a number of positive factors that also we can benefit from. We\u2019ve seen that in January, by the way. The start of this year has been very encouraging. And look, the idea of all the simplification work we\u2019ve done is that so we are simple, so we are agile, and agile means we can dynamically react and support our customers.\n\nAnd we will adapt quickly. We will react. We will make sure that we\u2019re supporting our customers along these journeys. Thank you, Kian.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Let\u2019s take one more from the call. Ben Toms, from RBC.\n\nBenjamin Toms: Good morning, both. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on capital, please. In relation to your CET1 ratio guidance of 14% to 14.5%, before today, this used to have a caveat: you\u2019d aim to manage this down further over time. I just note that that hasn\u2019t been mentioned in today\u2019s update. What are your latest thoughts on your medium- term ambitions for the CET1 ratio and has there been any change in sentiment? And then, secondly, on costs in relation to your $1.5 billion of savings, you note that they will be taken to the bottom line, although presumably there\u2019ll be offsets from drivers such as inflation. Maybe you could just clarify directionally what you expect the shape of costs will do coming out of 2025 and going into 2026 and 2027? Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Ben, for the two questions. I am going to ask Pam to address both your questions, Ben, but remember, our capital, our CET1 ratio today is at 14.9%. So we\u2019re well above our medium-term operating range and expect to remain so this quarter. So the question is really a medium to long term as opposed to anything now. Pam.\n\nPam Kaur: Yes. Thanks, Georges. And Ben, coming to your first question, we are very comfortable operating between the 14% to 14.5% range. The comment on looking at it again was removed some time ago, so no change for now in that respect. I want to just unbundle a little bit more on the cost point. So on the cost point, if you look at the guidance that we have, and this is the $1.5 billion of cost savings that are going straight to the bottom line. So the way we\u2019ve looked at it is that it\u2019s about 4%, if you look at inflation, as well as BAU investment. The benefit of that $1.5 billion this year that we are taking straight to the bottom line is $300 million. So if you compare to on a target basis, and you\u2019re starting excluding disposals and hyperinflation, you start from 2024, it\u2019s going to be a 3% year-on-year growth.\n\nSo that\u2019s what we are looking at. Now, severance and other one-off costs, they will be treated as notable items. Now, the timing of the $1.5 billion, yes, is $300 million this year. There\u2019ll be more to come, clearly, in 2026. We see the full benefit of the $1.5 billion savings coming through for the full-year 2027, and the severance costs, et cetera, will be more upfront.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Ben.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s come back to the room. So I think we have Kunpeng and then Jeremy.\n\nKunpeng Ma: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. This is Kunpeng of China Securities. And congratulations to the very strong result. I also have two questions. The first question is a little bit out of the bank itself. And Georges, could you please share us some color on the global trade business and also the wealth management business? I mean your feelings about the trends in these two businesses. I think, as a CEO, your feeling must be quite insightful. The second is about the new business areas you mentioned, along with your reform. I think many of them are non-capital consuming. So to what level should we expect the revenue structure to change to, going forward? Maybe the non-NII portion will be much higher than one- third. Yeah, that\u2019s my two questions. Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kun. I\u2019ll take your first question, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question. So, look, trade and wealth. First, it\u2019s very difficult to predict what will happen to global trade in an uncertain environment, but what we can say is, for the last eight years, that trade has started to become more disrupted. Global trade has continued growing, low-single-digit percentage points. The trade routes have reconfigured. ASEAN has become the largest trading partner of China, ahead of the U.S. and Europe. We\u2019ve seen more intra-regional trade pick up. We\u2019ve seen more fragmentation of trade routes. So rather than the goods moving from point A to point B from, say, manufacturing to consumption, they\u2019re usually going through multiple legs on the journey, across various other jurisdictions.\n\nNow, it so happens that we still have expectations that global trade will grow at low-single-digit percentage points. And it so happens that this reconfiguration segmentation is playing to our strength, because many of these new jurisdictions that have become major participants in global trade are jurisdictions where we have deep presence and, in some cases, leading presence as an international bank, and we are able to capture these flows and we will be supporting our customers along these routes. In wealth, again, if you look at various analysts and consultants\u2019 consideration, Asia and Middle East wealth is expected to grow at high single digit into 10% CAGR for the next five years. So the underlying trend of the growth of the middle class in many of these Asian economies is there.\n\nAnd simply being a leading bank in this space, we benefit from this underlying trend, but what we are doing is we also want to increase our market share because, in some areas, apart from Hong Kong, where we\u2019ve really been a leading player, in other places, we\u2019ve been punching below our weight. And the idea is to be able to step up our product capabilities, our customer reach, the various metrics, which I shared in the slide without repeating. And the additional investment is not only to capture the underlying trend, but also to grow to our more natural share. This will be focused essentially on Asia and the Middle East. We recognize there are other pockets of wealth that will be important for us, but we\u2019re not going to be a wealth player in the U.S. because we don\u2019t have the right to win.\n\nPam.\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. So just in terms of our focus on both NII and fee income, clearly, as we sit today, our NII, given our strong balance sheet, deposit base, loans and advances, is a much bigger proportion of earnings compared to fee income. But given the guidance we\u2019ve just shared with you, that we are looking at double-digit growth in Wealth over the medium term, even though it\u2019s on a smaller base, whereas on loans and advances, we are looking at a mid-single-digit growth in the medium-term. So that balance will tilt, but I won\u2019t go over my skates just as yet because the baseline starting point is so much bigger for balance sheet-driven business as opposed to fee income, but in direction of travel, absolutely.\n\nAnd also, the two things are a bit correlated. Hopefully, with your customers, when you do more, it\u2019s not just balance sheet-related products. You do more fee income-driven. And we think that really gets us more into the space of hearts and minds of our customers, which is what we are here for.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Kun.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Jeremy?\n\nJeremy Hou: Thank you for taking up my question. My first question is related to the capital distribution. Thank you for elaborating on the capital distribution hierarchy, but I recognise that you are guiding to a mid-teens RoTE for the next three years, but only a 50% dividend payout for 2025. So what are the implications behind it? And we can see the bank\u2019s share price is above one-times price to book, so will that affect your future consideration between buybacks and maybe raise the dividend payout? And the second question is on the loan growth. HSBC has been consistently guiding to a mid- single-digit loan growth for the medium to long term, but it\u2019s still very challenging in the near term. So what circumstances do you think might be necessary for the bank to finally hit the target, and to what extent is that loan growth assumption baked into our Banking NII guidance? Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Jeremy. I\u2019ll ask Pam to address both questions. Let me share some insight on capital distribution. Look, with a mid-teens return guidance, there\u2019s plenty of space to do the 50% dividend payout ratio and to support the businesses to grow, which has always been the priority use of additional capital. But as you said, loan growth hasn\u2019t been there for the last many quarters, and the opportunity for us was to return the excess capital through share buybacks. It remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, because we see this also as a means to create an accretion in our dividend per share \u2013 earnings per share and dividends per share, by reducing the share count. Pam?\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. Firstly, in terms of our views on the 50% earnings per share, we are very comfortable with that number, and as you can see, we look at obviously distribution but also opportunities for growth that we can deploy our surplus capital. I\u2019m very pleased that we are trading above tangible book value, and we absolutely don\u2019t consider the tangible book value to be a ceiling for our buybacks. Share buybacks will continue to be our preferred mode of distribution going forward. The other thing on dividends is that you obviously have to look at where your CET1 is at a point of time. You have to look at regulatory changes. For now 50%, we\u2019re very comfortable with. Now, in terms of your next question on loan growth, we need to unbundle it a little bit.\n\nYes, loan growth is flat. It was down $3 billion in Hong Kong, up $3 billion for the rest of Asia, up $1 billion for the UK, down $1 billion for the rest of the world. We are optimistic that as the interest rate trajectory stabilizes there will be customer demand, and when there\u2019s customer demand we\u2019ll be there obviously to support our customers. But what\u2019s also really important is as we\u2019re seeing that from a Hong Kong perspective there is some momentum coming back, we expect at least the loan trajectory in Hong Kong to stabilise and not reduce. Once that happens, given the other breakdown I\u2019ve given you, that gives us more optimism in terms of loan growth.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Jeremy.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s go back to the call. Andy Coombs from Citigroup, please.\n\nAndy Coombs: Good morning. If I can have two follow-ups, please, firstly on the capital return and secondly on the costs. On the buybacks, if you could just clarify, the $2 billion is obviously a step down from $3 billion. Should we think about that as a permanent step down, given that you now need to absorb these upfront restructuring charges, or does the $2 billion reflect a shorter timing period between Q4 and Q1 results compared to other quarters? That\u2019s the first question. The second question, I want to have another stab at the costs. Ben asked about this. I think the walk to 2025 is very clear, but if we then think about the walk to 2026, should we assume a similar level of inflation and investment? Is 4% a fair assumption for future years in your view as well?\n\nThen when we eyeball slide 29, which has that cost phasing, and it looks like there\u2019s a $600 million, $700 million step up in the cost saves in 2026, before the full run rate is recognized in 2027. So are we looking at a 4% increase in 2026 from that 2025 guide, less another incremental $700 million of cost saves, so a sub-$34 billion cost number? Anything you can give us in terms of how to frame, more explicitly, that 2026 and 2027 cost base would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andy. Let me deal with your capital question, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to talk you through cost. But remember, we only guided return on tangible equity for 2026 and 2027. We haven\u2019t given additional specific guidance. So look, on capital, $2 billion because we have two months until April and that amount will be reviewed on a case-by-case, quarter-by-quarter basis. We do not pre-commit on any future amounts. It will depend on the outlook and the loan growth and other parameters as we get to it. But the current $2 billion is obviously because we have two months until the results in April. Pam?\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges. In terms of cost, we are not giving a cost guidance beyond full-year 2025. The big moving parts always when we look at our cost is what\u2019s the underlying inflation, staff costs and we also track very closely what\u2019s the increase in fixed pay from a staff cost perspective. So it was expected 3.6% in 2025. It was 4.4% in 2024, so you can see the trajectory shifting as obviously inflation is coming down. We also include in that 4%, and we have for 2025, additional investments, so you can do the math in terms of where we go to for 2026. But also let\u2019s be mindful, so far we\u2019re saying for 2025 we are only taking $300 million of the $1.5 billion down to the savings line, so there is an absolute tailwind for the rest of it coming through for 2026, so that\u2019s how the math works.\n\nAnd as we go into 2027, I would expect two things to happen. You\u2019ll see some normalization on the inflation and the underlying built number. We will have the BAU investment, so that continues the same building block, but what\u2019s important is even though the $1.5 billion has been taken down to the bottom line we expect through our simplification some of the additional efficiency costs beyond just FTE-related costs, i.e. the ways of working, so that will give us some tailwind, but obviously not to the same extent as you\u2019ve had in 2026.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Andy.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Our next question is from Amit Goel at Mediobanca. Amit, you\u2019re on mute.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Amit, you maybe still on mute.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Amit, we will \u2013 we can come back to you. Let\u2019s go to\u2026\n\nAmit Goel: Sorry. Actually, the system wouldn\u2019t allow me to unmute myself. Thank you. So two questions then from me. One is, again, just when you\u2019re talking about the mid-teens RoTE target, so this year on a reported basis it was 14.6%, on ex notable items 16%. I just wanted to see, are you thinking about that more in line with the underlying ex notable items level that you\u2019ve achieved this year and that you can maintain that given the cost savings and wealth management growth that you\u2019re targeting, or are you looking at it closer to the reported number that you achieved in 2024? Then secondly, I just wanted to dig in a bit more in terms of the potential revenue impact or lack of from the cost actions, including the re-prioritization, just to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the marginal or negligible revenue impact. Is that because you just expect the revenue growth elsewhere from the reallocation of cost, or how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you very much, Amit. I\u2019ll take your first question and I\u2019ll ask Pam to address your second question about how we\u2019re looking to phase cost and the reallocation and the revenue impact of that. Look, it\u2019s quite simple for the first question. What we mean by mid-teens is around 14% to 16%, and our target is on return on tangible equity excluding notable items. This is how you should look at it. Pam?\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Georges and Amit. Just adding a little bit to the RoTE question, mid- teens is mid-teens, what it says on the tin: 14 to 16%. It\u2019s a target and obviously, if the world\u2019s in a better place, there is an upside, but you also have to look at the downside and that\u2019s how we look at all scenarios in our assumptions. Coming back to your second question on the $1.5 billion. Firstly I want to clarify, the first $1.5 billion, which is simplification savings, has no revenue impact because it\u2019s literally more senior roles, deduplication, simplifying the matrix. On that, there is no revenue impact and the whole savings is a tailwind which goes straight to the bottom line. On the second $1.5 billion, which is different, it is clearly a reallocation, which will happen from the individual business level, but we will take it all to the Group level.\n\nNow, when you take it all to the Group level, there is going to be some time lag between the cost coming up and re-investing, but we do think that the payback period is pretty quick because we know it\u2019s in existing areas we want to reinvest. So that time lag on the revenue should not be that long and that will get compensated. But as we have said before, we are taking this reallocation of cost, particularly from two areas: ones where we are sub-scale, and so materially it doesn\u2019t really make an impact in terms of your profit \u2013 they\u2019re small-scale divestments \u2013 but there are others where in terms of profitability they are not materially profitable, like we said on the investment bank. Therefore, as we take them through into new areas with higher returns and being very focused on those which are our competitive strengths, we do think that positivity will come back pretty quickly.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Amit.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Any more in the room before we go back to the \u2013 Is that Katherine? Okay. Katherine, please.\n\nKatherine Lei: Thank you. I\u2019m Katherine from JPMorgan. I just want to clarify on the cost questions. I would like to ask about the second $1.5 billion. Have we factored that in the mid-teens RoTE guidance? Because when we are exiting some business, we need some regulatory approval and it\u2019s hard to gauge the timeline. What assumptions do we have regarding these parts in our mid-teens RoTE guidance? The underlying question is will we see some upside, because if we do it faster or slower like that. The second one, I still want to ask about CRE question. I think it\u2019s an old question, but I think we still have a lot of people, a lot of investors care about it. Both in Hong Kong and China in last quarter we heard some events which led to some concerns on these areas. If I look at our Q4 numbers, I know that some are edging up on the ECL charges. Is any parts of that related to CRE and what is our outlook on CRE in both regions? Thank you.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine. I\u2019m going to ask Pam to address both your questions but let me share with you just briefly my outlook on the CRE situation. So firstly, in mainland China we believe that we\u2019ve hit a trough, really, in the challenges that the sector has faced. We believe the measures that have been taken to stabilise and start a normalisation process are working their way effectively through the economy. But more importantly, our exposure has materially reduced and therefore it is not going to be any more any major driver for our ECL. Second, about Hong Kong. We\u2019re actually positive about the outlook of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, first the economy and certainly rate trajectory is going to support that, we\u2019re seeing growth manifest in 2024, in growth outlook in 2025 and a number of sectors really have revived.\n\nBut also in the CRE space, the underlying CRE market in Hong Kong is strong and resilient. The supply/demand equation is very supportive for the medium to long term and as we said, the rate outlook will also support that. But then if you look at our exposure to many of the borrowers in the space, the borrowers are much stronger and much less leveraged than what we\u2019ve seen in the China CRE space. They are in a better balance sheet position, albeit they may have cash flow challenges due to high rates, et cetera, but the loan to valuation we have on our exposure is also very strong. We are in the 50s percent. Therefore, we do not think the Hong Kong CRE exposure in our books will be any material driver of our future ECLs. Pam can address your questions on cost and take you more specifically in the CRE elements.\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you for your question. So firstly, yes, we have factored the reallocation into our mid-teens RoTE guidance, and we\u2019ll work as quickly as we can to reallocate costs to higher- return areas. Obviously, if it is faster than our assumptions \u2013 we tend to be a bit conservative, which is a good space to be, then there will be some upside. But given regulatory approvals, et cetera, things can be slower. But all in all, we are still very comfortable to have a mid-teens RoTE for each of the next three years. I\u2019ll take the China CRE question first, and then I\u2019ll do Hong Kong CRE. Now China CRE, we\u2019ve always been very comfortable with our onshore exposure, which has been secured. The issue really has been with the offshore exposure, which was unsecured, but that number is way down from where we started.\n\nWe are now down to $2.2 billion net of ECLs, and, out of that, there is very little of the exposures where we feel that there is more headwind. And as you can see, the chart for ECL last year was much lower than the prior years. So that, I think, gives me a sense of optimism with regard to the trajectory of the China CRE outlook. And of course, you can have one-off cases, and things move on, but, overall, it\u2019s based upon our exposure. Now, on Hong Kong CRE, just as a starting point, as long as the interest rate trajectory is high, of course you can see some customers facing headwinds, because it\u2019s a cash flow issue, fundamentally, and that makes you bring more names into the stage 3s. But what\u2019s very important to note is that, despite them coming into stage 3s, our ECLs haven\u2019t increased, and the answer is quite simple.\n\nMost of the names coming through the stage 3s last year have been from a secured portfolio, which is 54% of our total portfolio. And as Georges said, there\u2019s a very high level of collateralization. I mean, average LTV on sub-standard is 46% and, on the impaired, is at 58%, so there\u2019s enough room in that space and there is strong collateral. So even when they go to stage 3, there is not an ECL increase, and the ECL increase this year has been minimal and we see nothing changing there. On the unsecured, 90% of it is investment grade, so 46% of portfolio is unsecured; 90% is investment grade. And it\u2019s primarily with the conglomerates and strong developers and, because they have diversified cash flows, the inflow into stage 3 from this portion of the book is very small.\n\nSo all in all, even though, with the increase in stage 3s, you see a minimal uplift in RWAs and the capital impact, but a very small capital impact, from an ECL perspective, there is really no material change in the ECL trajectory at this point of time, and we are very comfortable that it\u2019s all well within our mid-term guidance of 30 to 40 basis points.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Katherine.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Let\u2019s go to Joe Dickerson from Jefferies, please.\n\nJoe Dickerson: Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one following on from the Hong Kong CRE question. If I look at the ECL allowance to stage 3, it was 67% FY2023, and that\u2019s fallen to, I think, about 26%, 25%, 26% in respect of full-year for the Hong Kong piece. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering what explains that decline. Is it the proportion of the stage 3s that are secured that\u2019s driving that reduction in coverage? Or what\u2019s the answer there, and how low can that number go?\n\nPam Kaur: Yes. I\u2019m happy to take the question, thank you. You\u2019re absolutely right. It is really because all of the stage 3s, virtually \u2013 a very large majority is coming through from the secured and, given the cover, ECL coverage is dropping through. But also we\u2019ve written off some of the China CRE exposure overall, and you should think in terms of total exposures that we have, and that\u2019s also reducing the ECL coverage.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Joe.\n\nNeil Sankoff: Thank you. Our next question is from Aman Rakkar at Barclays.\n\nAman Rakkar: Hi, guys. Good morning, Pam. Good morning, Georges. I had two questions. I think you\u2019re pointing to much better pre-provision profit outlook than consensus. I guess we\u2019ve laboured the discussion around costs, but my takeaway is that it is broadly flattish beyond 2025, and maybe a bit of growth, but well lower than where the street is. I think Banking NII guidance also speaks for itself, so there are two related questions to that. One is around non-interest income. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts on non-interest income, but I think you\u2019re coming in with significant momentum on non-interest income, in excess of consensus, but we do have a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything you can do to help us? I know you don\u2019t like to talk too much about non-interest income, because there\u2019s volatile line items in it, but you\u2019ve got double-digit growth momentum in wealth management, trade that\u2019s probably growing low to mid-single digits.\n\nWho knows what markets do, but they\u2019re probably not going backwards. Then you\u2019ve got a retail piece as well. But it just does feel like that is something that is trending well in excess. So if you were able to comment in respect of 2025 consensus, that would be really helpful. The second is about Banking NII. So the $42 billion guidance this year is great. And I know there\u2019s a lot of focus on lending, but really it\u2019s deposits that matter, right? You alluded to the strength of your franchise. And loans are going to be subdued for a while, but deposits are already growing and, indeed, they\u2019re going to continue growing from here. Can you try and help us with that? Are you able to quantify the deposit growth and average interest-earning asset growth that we might look to expect?\n\nBecause I think you can comfortably grow your balance sheet despite a subdued demand dynamic in your key markets. I think that really helps underpin the kind of Banking NII beyond 2025. My kind of slight follow-up question, then, I\u2019m going to sneak it in, but it\u2019s just around FX. And if you were to mark to market any of the cost guide, for example, for the spot FX rate, if that would affect any of your kind of guide or commentary today, that would be really helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Thank you, Aman. I\u2019ll ask Pam to handle your Banking NII question and the FX question, which will have an impact on our Banking NII guidance. I\u2019ll take your first question by saying, \u2018Nice try\u2019. Unfortunately, I cannot give you more than what we shared. What we\u2019ve shared is a confidence that we\u2019re running the bank towards a mid-teens target on return on tangible equity excluding notable items for 2025, 2026 and 2027. We\u2019re also guiding to a medium-term outlook on Wealth at double-digit growth, which we\u2019re comfortable with, given this is an area where we\u2019re investing in and we see the underlying trends supportive, but this is more a medium-term guidance. It\u2019s difficult to evaluate what it means on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis.\n\nAnd we\u2019re also comfortable that our wholesale transaction banking \u2013 given our strong leadership position in many of these areas, we will be able to ride the wave, and we think the wave \u2013 the macro is in a low-single-digit percentage growth. It\u2019s subject to possible disruptions, but the underlying trend, if you look at global trade with all forms of corridors \u2013 not just some of the disrupted corridors \u2013 other corridors are likely to continue growing. I think this is how you should look at it. And remember the rate trajectory as well. It\u2019s still uncertain, but that will be a way if we see faster rate cuts than we\u2019ve implied. Let me just pause here on that part of the question and ask Pam to take you through Banking NII and FX.\n\nPam Kaur: Thank you, Aman. So firstly, our cost guidance is on a constant currency basis, so clearly, from an FX perspective, there could be an impact. In terms of the $42 billion guidance, you\u2019re right. On loans, we say it\u2019s mid-single-digit growth in the medium term, and lower rates will help to get some momentum back, but it\u2019s also driven by overall market confidence, so I can\u2019t really call out the timing of the return to loan growth exactly. Now, deposits, clearly, was a key one in the fourth quarter, but we know that, in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s a bit of a seasonality effect, so I would very much caution you against annualizing that number. But I think, in terms of deposits, if I look at just the drivers for the $42 billion guidance, there\u2019s interest rates, which is a headwind at this point of time, given the market-implied rate curves, and then there is the structural hedge, which will be a tailwind.\n\nThe loans, we have talked about. On deposits, we feel very lucky to have a strong deposit base, as you\u2019ve said, and the trust of our customers to give us those deposits is a cornerstone for our strong balance sheet. The deposit benefit for next year is driven by what\u2019s going to be the time deposit mix, because that held through in the fourth quarter. As the interest rates come down, we expect the time deposit mix to also come down. So in that context, you can factor that in as part of your overall calculation in terms of the headwinds and the tailwinds.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Thank you, Aman.\n\nNeil Sankoff: And our last question today comes from Rob Noble at Deutsche Numis.\n\nRobert Noble: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the $1.5 billion of reallocation in the strategy. How much line of sight do you have on it at this point? So I presume GBM, Germany and France is around $500 million in costs. Do you know where the other $1 billion is coming from, and the phasing of it? And then, linked to that, what are the restructuring charges from this part of the strategy? Should I still be thinking about 1.2x the costs saved as additional below-the-line items against that $1.5 billion, or is that the wrong way to think about it?\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Okay. Thank you, Rob, for the question. Look, let me handle the reallocation, and I\u2019ll ask Pam to comment on the cost implication and treatment, if you want. So first, look your math is right. There are a number of activities we already called out. The investment banking refocus will generate around $0.3 billion of saves, and we\u2019ll lose about $0.3 billion of revenue against it, so that\u2019s quite there. We did announce the German Private Bank, the French insurance. We announced this morning also the sale of our Bahrain retail business. So those are kind of in motion. There are a number of other things we\u2019ve called out that are in motion. There are a number of selectively identified number of activities that are non-strategic, which we\u2019re working on, and they\u2019ll be a continuation of that journey.\n\nIf you just kind of note that we said this is a medium-term number. We haven\u2019t given a strict deadline, because some of these actions may take longer or may be subject to various approvals that are beyond our control, and we will be able to share with you as and when we move forward. Pam?\n\nPam Kaur: Thanks. So first, yes, we have identified the rest of the costs. We can\u2019t give a precise cost at this point of time. We\u2019ll obviously keep you updated over the next quarters. Now, in terms of the one-off costs, yes, there will be severance and other one-off costs, and we will be looking at those costs, to a large extent, given the materiality, where there is, from a notable \u2013 as notable items, so that\u2019s kind of the broad picture in terms of how we\u2019re progressing. So good broad line beyond where we are, but I can\u2019t give you any more precision at this point of time.\n\nGeorges Elhedery: Perfect. Thank you very much, Rob. Okay. Well, thank you, all, for your questions. So in closing, strong 2024 performance. This provides us firm foundations upon which we are building. We\u2019ve simplified the Group and, along with our continued focus on costs, as Pam said, we are committed to delivering circa $1.5 billion of savings to the bottom line. We\u2019re also focused on delivering for our customers by capturing growth opportunities where we have a clear competitive advantage and accretive returns. And we are eliminating, over the medium term, an additional circa $1.5 billion of costs from non-strategic or low-returning activities, and redeploying them into these priority growth areas. We\u2019re also targeting a mid-teens return on tangible equity in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027.\n\nAs usual, Neil and the team are available for any follow-ups. Meanwhile, Pam and I hope to see many of you here in Hong Kong next month for our second HSBC Global Investment Summit. Enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nOperator: Thank you.

Borrowers have to be proactive with their broker to capture the best options before their renewal is due.\u201d\n\nA boost of confidence\n\nEarlier this month, the Bank of England cut rates by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent.\n\nIn its first meeting of 2025, the bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted seven to two in favour of the drop from 4.75 per cent.\n\nThe committee said: \u201cThere has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations.\u201d\n\nHowever, following this, inflation rose.\n\nAmid the volatility, David Stirling, director at Mint Mortgages & Protection, said the bank has given people something to look forward to.\n\nHe said it is always a positive sign when rates are heading in the right direction for borrowers.\n\n\u201cBooking rates early is a smart move, as it often allows borrowers to take advantage of even lower rates if they become available before their completion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny downward momentum is certainly a win for those looking to borrow.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Simon Bridgland, director at Release Freedom, described HSBC\u2019s decision as \u201ca sure sign of further confidence\u201d.\n\n\u201cBrokers and borrowers are hoping for some further bank base rate cuts throughout this year and it seems as if HSBC believes it could happen.\n\n\u201cConfidence is a major driver of the property market and if lenders hold their nerve and give the consumer what they are asking for it could snowball.\n\n\u201cI would expect to see further fixed rate cuts announced over the next few days from other major banks.\u201d\n\nThanks to the Newspage community for sharing their thoughts with FTAdviser\n\nsonia.rach@ft.com",

            "content": "Last year, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF ranked as the biggest winner among Vanguard's exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That's not surprising. The ETF owns big stakes in stocks like Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, all of which soared in 2024.\n\nHowever, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF isn't the best performer in the Vanguard family so far in 2025. Instead, it's an ETF that doesn't own a single share in Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Apple, or any other so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. In fact, this Vanguard ETF doesn't hold any stock in the S&P 500.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nLook across the pond\n\nWhich Vanguard ETF am I talking about? It's the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF(NYSEMKT: VGK). This fund is up roughly 11% year to date, a higher return than any other Vanguard ETF.\n\nThe ETF's name gives away its focus. The Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF owns only the stocks of companies based in Europe. It attempts to track the performance of the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index, which includes companies located in the following major European markets: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis Vanguard ETF currently owns 1,269 stocks. No single holding makes up more than 2.43% of the entire portfolio. The ETF's top five positions are German software company SAP, Dutch semiconductor-fabrication equipment leader ASML Holding NV, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, Swiss food and beverage company Nestl\u00e9, and Swiss healthcare giant Roche Holding AG.\n\nLike all Vanguard ETFs, the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF is cost-effective for investors to own. Its annual expense ratio is a low 0.06% compared to an average of 0.93% for similar funds.\n\nWhy is this Vanguard ETF outperforming so far in 2025?\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF has emphatically not been the best Vanguard fund to own over the long term. Since its inception on March 4, 2005, the ETF's average annual return is only 5.14%. The S&P 500 delivered a return roughly 10.7 times higher during the period. Including dividends helps narrow the gap somewhat. However, the S&P 500's total return was still more than 3.6 times greater than the total return of the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF performed dismally in 2024. While the S&P 500 jumped 23%, this Vanguard ETF declined by nearly 2%.\n\nSo, what happened to turn things around this year? The simple answer is that several of the European stocks in the ETF's portfolio have started 2025 with a bang.\n\nFor example, SAP's shares have soared close to 17% year to date. Roche isn't far behind. British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, Nestl\u00e9, Novartis, and British financial services giant HSBC Holdings, all top 10 holdings for the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF, have risen by double-digit percentages. Many European stocks have risen in recent weeks as expectations increased for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nIs the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF a no-brainer buy?\n\nEverybody loves a winner. Is the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF a no-brainer buy? I wouldn't go that far.\n\nIt's not a bad idea to diversify your portfolio geographically. If you own nothing but U.S. stocks, adding the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF could be a practical thing to do.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that just because this Vanguard ETF is outperforming all other Vanguard ETFs now doesn't mean it will continue to do so. A deal to end hostilities between Russia and Ukraine could fail to materialize. The prospect of steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on European imports could also derail the momentum of the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF.\n\nWe're less than one-sixth of the way through 2025. While the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF could deliver solid gains this year, I predict other Vanguard ETFs will be bigger winners before the year is over.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "(Feb 21): Four major banks will pay fines totalling over \u00a3100 million (US$127 million or RM558.83 million) to settle a long-running antitrust case over collusion by their traders, who shared sensitive information in chatrooms about buying and selling gilts after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nTraders at Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings plc, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) unlawfully shared details on pricing and trading in chatrooms between 2009 and 2013, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday. Deutsche Bank AG was exempted from the penalty, as it was the first to self-report its involvement.\n\nThe fines bring to an end the investigation that began in 2018. The probe focused on the conduct of a small number of traders who worked at the banks, and involved the sharing of pricing and trading strategies around UK government gilt auctions.\n\nAntitrust watchdogs across Europe have spent more than a decade probing how bank traders swapped information in chatrooms, leading to billions of euros in fines. The investigations followed the EU\u2019s approval for billions of euros in government support to keep many European lenders alive during the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cDeutsche Bank and RBC also coordinated their strategies for trading gilts via brokers on a limited number of occasions,\u201d the CMA said in the statement.\n\nSome of the alleged collusion happened in relation to Bank of England holding buy-back auctions in 2009, in response to the financial crisis as a part of its quantitative easing policy.\n\nThe CMA hasn\u2019t made any findings about the impact on the market or financial benefit to the firm, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson said. \u201cMorgan Stanley has taken the commercial decision to draw a line under this long-running CMA investigation into the actions of a single former employee approximately 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank \u201cproactively reported the issue\u201d to the UK authority and cooperated in the investigation, its spokesperson said.\n\nBank Fine Discount Citi \u00a317.2 million 35% leniency discount and a 20% reduction for settling at an early stage HSBC \u00a323.4 million 10% reduction for settling Morgan Stanley \u00a329.7 million 10% reduction for settling RBC \u00a334.2 million 10% reduction for settling\n\nCiti cooperated with the CMA and remains committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance, its spokesperson said following the announcement. HSBC has transformed its controls since 2009-10, and has a robust compliance programme, a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe conduct in question was historic, and our compliance environment has significantly enhanced over the last decade,\u201d a spokesperson for the RBC said.",

            "content": "Investors in HSBC Holdings plc (Symbol: HSBC) saw new options become available today, for the April 17th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HSBC options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of HSBC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.26/share today.\n\nBecause the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.09% return on the cash commitment, or 0.59% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for HSBC Holdings plc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example above is 28%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.26) to be 20%.

The sharing of information occurred in one-to-one exchanges between traders about the buying and selling of gilts and gilt asset swaps.\n\nThis conduct took place on various dates between 2009-2013, with the last exchanges occurring in 2010 for HSBC, 2012 for Morgan Stanley, and 2013 for each of Citi, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. Since then, the banks have implemented extensive compliance measures to ensure this behaviour does not happen again.\n\nEach of the exchanges took place in separate bilateral online Bloomberg chatrooms between individual traders at two banks and included information relevant to the pricing of UK government bonds \u2013 specifically, gilts and gilt asset swaps.\n\nIn particular, each one-to-one exchange of information took place in relation to one or more of the following: firstly, the sale of gilts by the UK Debt Management Office via auctions on behalf of HM Treasury, secondly the subsequent buying and selling, i.e. trading, of gilts and gilt asset swaps, and thirdly the selling of gilts to the Bank of England \u2013 known as \u2018buy back\u2019. Not all banks were involved in unlawful exchanges in all three contexts.\n\nFour banks \u2013 Citi, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada \u2013 have settled and agreed to pay fines totalling \u00a3104,460,000.\n\nDeutsche Bank is exempt from a financial penalty as it alerted the CMA to its participation in the chats via the authority\u2019s leniency policy. Citi applied for leniency during the CMA\u2019s investigation and as a result has received a reduced fine.\n\nIn agreeing to settle with the CMA, the banks have agreed to pay these fines, bringing the investigation to a close.\n\nThe fines for each bank are:\n\nCiti: \u00a317,160,000 \u2013 this includes a 35% leniency discount and a 20% reduction for settling in advance of the CMA issuing its Statement of Objections\n\nHSBC: \u00a323,400,000 \u2013 this includes a 10% reduction for settling after the CMA issued its Statement of Objections\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u00a329,700,000 \u2013 this includes a 10% reduction for settling after the CMA issued its Statement of Objections\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada: \u00a334,200,000 \u2013 this includes a 10% reduction for settling after the CMA issued its Statement of Objections\n\nThe fines take into account the length of time that has passed since the end of the infringements and the extensive compliance measures that the banks have implemented since then \u2013 some of which were in place before the start of the CMA\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe firms have until 22 April 2025 to pay their fines.",

A: Georges Elhedery, CEO: We haven't given specific medium-term returns for CIB, but the business will benefit from significant cost synergies due to the merger of two wholesale businesses. We expect improvements through cost savings, capital allocation efficiencies, and increased fee income. CIB is a leading business in Wholesale Transaction Banking and has a strong deposit franchise, which supports its profitability.\n\nQ: How should we think about incremental technology or new apps in International Wealth and Premier Banking (IWPB) to gain market share in cross-border wealth? A: Georges Elhedery, CEO: IWPB is a major growth engine, especially in Hong Kong, which is becoming the world's largest cross-border wealth hub. We are investing in relationship managers, wealth centers, and technology capabilities. Our brand is strong in Asia and the Middle East, and we aim to capture more cross-border flows and increase our market share.\n\nQ: Can you elaborate on the $1.5 billion reallocation of costs and the expected return on investment? A: Georges Elhedery, CEO: The reallocation is from nonstrategic or low-return activities to areas with competitive advantages and better returns, such as Wealth and Transaction Banking. The wind down of M&A and ECM activities will free up $300 million for reinvestment. These areas are fee-driven with low RWA impact, and we expect higher returns from these investments.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on the medium-term ambition for the CET1 ratio and cost savings? A: Pam Kaur, CFO: We are comfortable operating within a 14% to 14.5% CET1 ratio range. The $1.5 billion cost savings will be taken to the bottom line, with $300 million recognized in 2025. We expect full savings by 2027, with severance costs incurred upfront.\n\nQ: How do you view the Global Trade and Wealth Management business trends? A: Georges Elhedery, CEO: Global Trade is expected to grow at low single-digit percentages, with reconfigured trade routes benefiting our presence in key markets. Wealth in Asia and the Middle East is projected to grow at high single-digit to 10% CAGR over the next five years. We aim to increase our market share in these regions by enhancing product capabilities and customer reach.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

In Continental Europe, we are focused on serving corporate and institutional clients, with a particular focus on connecting them to international markets, financing and facilitating trade within Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world. We also serve international high and ultra-high net worth clients of the HSBC Group through our private banking business in Luxembourg.\n\nIn the second half of 2024, we accelerated our strategy by signing an agreement to sell our private banking business in Germany and a Memorandum of Understanding for the potential sale of our life insurance business in France1.\n\nOur results in 2024 reflected growth in wholesale transaction banking and financing, offset by the impact of lower interest rates and our ongoing business transformation.\n\n2024 annual results\n\nProfit before tax2 was \u20ac930m in 2024.\n\nNet operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges2 was \u20ac3,349m, down from \u20ac3,720m in 2023, driven by lower net interest income following the sale of the retail banking operations in France. Commercial Banking revenues were down compared to last year, driven by lower margins on customer deposits in Global Payment Solutions, while Global Banking revenues were higher due to growth in Investment Banking. Revenues in Markets and Securities Services were stable, with growth in Equities and Securities Financing offset by lower client activity in Global Debt Markets.\n\nChange in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges2 was a charge of \u20ac97m, compared with a charge of \u20ac145m in 2023. The cost of risk3 fell to 19bps, with the decrease compared to last year driven by lower stage 3 provisions, particularly in Global Banking.\n\nOperating expenses2 were \u20ac2,322m, up from \u20ac2,250m in 2023, driven by the full-year consolidation of the financial results of HSBC Private Bank (Luxembourg) S.A. and higher infrastructure and technology costs.

The planned sale, which remains subject to governmental approvals and works council consultation, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025.\n\nOn 20 December 2024, HSBC Continental Europe signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the potential sale of its life insurance business in France, HSBC Assurances Vie (France), to Matmut Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Assurance Mutuelle. The completion of the transaction, which remains subject to consultation processes with respective works councils and regulatory and competition approvals, is expected to take place in the second half of 2025.\n\nAccounting policy for classifying non-current assets or disposal groups as \u2018held for sale\u2019\n\nHSBC Continental Europe classifies non-current assets or disposal groups (including assets and liabilities) as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. To be classified as held for sale, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups, and the sale must be highly probable.\n\nAt 31 December 2024, HSBC Continental Europe judged that the sale of its private banking business in Germany and the sale of its life insurance business in France were highly probable to complete in the second half of 2025. As such, and in accordance with IFRS 5, the disposal groups that included \u20ac25.5bn of assets and \u20ac24.7bn of liabilities were classified as held for sale and re-measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe life insurance business in France also met the criteria of discontinued operations classification and presentation under IFRS 5, and accordingly, the profit/(loss) of the discontinued operations has been reported separately in the income statement.\n\nUpon being classified as held for sale in 2023, retail banking operations in France (sold on 1 January 2024) were judged to have met the criteria of discontinued operations classification and presentation under IFRS 5 for the 2023 comparatives.\n\nHSBC Continental Europe\n\nHeadquartered in Paris, HSBC Continental Europe is an indirectly held subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc. HSBC Continental Europe principally comprises, in addition to its banking, insurance and asset management activities based in France, the business activities of 10 European branches (in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden) and two banking subsidiaries in Continental Europe (in Luxembourg and Malta). HSBC Continental Europe\u2019s mission is to serve both customers in Continental Europe for their needs worldwide and customers in other Group countries for their needs in Continental Europe.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc\n\nHSBC Holdings plc, the parent company of the HSBC Group, is headquartered in London. HSBC serves customers worldwide from offices in 58 countries and territories. With assets of US$3,017bn at 31 December 2024, HSBC is one of the world\u2019s largest banking and financial services organisations.\n\n1 See appendix for details on business disposals\n\n2 In respect of continuing operations in accordance with IFRS 5 (see appendix)\n\n3 Change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges divided by customer loans outstanding at the end of the period.\n\n4 Computed in respect of the EU Delegated act\n\n5 Computed in respect of CRR II (Regulation EU 2019/876)\n\n6 LCR, NSFR and the solvency ratio of the life insurance subsidiary are unaudited\n\n7 In 2024, HSBC Continental Europe served its customers through the following business lines: \u2018Commercial Banking\u2019, \u2018Global Banking\u2019, \u2018Markets and Securities Services\u2019 and \u2018Wealth and Personal Banking\u2019. The 2024 results per business line are presented on this basis. Following the announcement by the HSBC Group of a new organisational structure in October 2024, and effective 1 January 2025, HSBC Continental Europe will operate through two new business lines: \u2018Corporate and Institutional Banking\u2019 covering the clients and products previously served by Commercial Banking, Global Banking, Markets and Securities Services, and \u2018International Wealth and Premier Banking\u2019 replacing Wealth and Personal Banking.\n\n8 See appendix\n\n9 In compliance with IFRS 5 standards, the comparatives have been represented to reflect discontinued operations related to the planned sale of the life insurance business in France. This also includes discontinued operations related the sale of the retail banking operations in France.",

The deal excludes its corporate and private banking businesses in Bahrain.\n\n\n\nThe deal will comprise a transfer of retail loans, deposits and accounts of nearly 76,000 customers to BBK. Financial details of the deal, which is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025, were kept under wraps.\n\n\n\nThis move aligns with HSBC\u2019s transformation plan to improve operating efficiency and a strategic shift toward the Asian region. In 2020, the company announced its transformation plan to reshape its underperforming businesses, simplify complex organizations and reduce costs.\n\nOther Restructuring Efforts by HSBC\n\nHSBC has been scaling back its operations in underperforming regions to reduce costs and accelerate its shift toward the Asian region.\n\n\n\nIn sync with this, last week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter reported to Reuters that HSBC has axed nearly 40 investment bankers in Hong Kong. Also, last month, Bloomberg reported that HSBC plans to close its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and some equities businesses in Europe and the Americas to enhance its focus on the Asian region.\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, the company agreed to sell its French life insurance arm, HSBC Assurances Vie (France), to Matmut Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Assurance Mutuelle.\n\n\n\nIn October 2024, the company announced an initiative to simplify its organizational structure and operate through four distinct lines of business \u2013 Hong Kong, UK, Corporate & Institutional Banking, and International Wealth & Premier Banking. The company announced the appointment of leadership teams across the segments in December 2024.\n\n\n\nIn September 2024, the company agreed to sell its private banking business in Germany to BNP Paribas and its South Africa business to FirstRand Bank and Absa.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in August 2024, the company announced a partnership with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance in India to bolster its insurance solutions business. In June 2024, the company acquired Citigroup's retail wealth management business in China, while in January, it acquired Singapore-based SilkRoad Property Partners Group.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, other European banks have been focusing on streamlining their global operations. In December 2024, the Financial Times reported that Deutsche Bank DB aims to strengthen its fixed-income trading business in the Americas. DB has been restructuring its IB operations since 2019 to establish itself among the top five banks in the United States.\n\n\n\nAlso, Reuters reported that UBS Group AG UBS intends to transform its wealth management business in the United States into six divisions and focus more on affluent clients below the ultra-wealthy level. The transformation plan indicates UBS\u2019 efforts to enhance its performance in the United States.\n\nHSBC\u2019s Zacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nOver the past year, shares of HSBC have rallied 39.2%, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 25.3%.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, HSBC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against the other cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, the global economy in 2025 is expected to face some tough challenges, with growth forecasts looking modest \u2013 the US GDP at 2.0%, the Eurozone at 0.9%, and China at 4.2%. Inflation may persist due to higher fiscal spending and potential tariff hikes, which could limit central banks' ability to lower interest rates. This could in turn lead to more market volatility. Productivity has been growing slowly, and in some cases, it has even declined, affecting long-term living standards. However, AI and new technologies could help drive productivity higher, though it will take time to see noticeable results.\n\nDespite these challenges, 2025 will be about navigating turbulent times, with a clear gap between the high-tech, high-productivity US economy and Europe, which is lagging behind. Policy focus is shifting from monetary to fiscal, with China taking the lead on new initiatives. Stocks, especially in the United States, remain a strong opportunity for growth, while European equities offer potential despite economic struggles.\n\nIn Q4 2024, S&P Global reported that US domestic stocks saw a net dividend increase of $11.7 billion, which was lower than the $13.7 billion increase in the same quarter last year. Overall, dividend increases totaled $14.2 billion for the quarter, which was down from $17.5 billion in Q4 2023. For the entire year, dividends grew by $53.3 billion, a significant jump from the previous year's $36.5 billion. On a per-share basis, the broader market's dividends hit a record, growing by 6% to $19.81 per share. In Q4 last year, there were 635 dividend increases, which is a 10.2% decrease compared to the 707 increases in Q4 2023.\n\nOver the past 12 months, total dividend increases amounted to $71.4 billion, up from $65.1 billion in the previous year. Interestingly, the number of companies cutting dividends decreased by 19.5% in Q4, with only 33 companies lowering their payouts, compared to 41 the year before. Here, we discuss some of the best cheap high dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter out stocks with dividend yields over 3% and P/E ratios under 15.

Last week, the market liked Barclays (LSE:BARC) and NatWest Group (LSE:NWG)\u2019s results. UK banks have had a decent run of late and HSBC is up 34% since 1 October.\n\nIn HSBC\u2019s case the hope is that cost-cutting and a shift in the bank\u2019s strategy will start to bear fruit. So far, so good. But what\u2019s the macro perspective?\n\nThe stock looks rich on eyeQ\u2019s models, it is 10.05% above macro-warranted model value of 804.36p. That\u2019s the richest fair value gap since May last year.\n\nThere are two health warnings. Macro Relevance of 47% means big-picture stuff such as inflation and the Bank of England\u2019s policy stance explain less than half of price action. That makes tomorrow\u2019s earnings more important.\n\nSecond, model value had been rising consistently for six months. But that improvement in macro conditions is showing signs of stalling. It\u2019s yet to make a new low and we need to see model value below late January\u2019s recent low at 794p to suggest a top has been formed and momentum is shifting lower.\n\nTo get an official bearish signal, we\u2019d need to see two developments; macro relevance rising above our 65% threshold for a macro regime, and model value making new local lows.\n\nSo, no definitive action from us at least not right here, right now. But the bottom line is that these don\u2019t look great levels to be chasing the upside from a purely macro perspective.",

            "content": "HSBC has laid off around 40 investment bankers in Hong Kong, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, as part of a global restructuring exercise at the Asia-focused lender to cut costs.\n\nThe job cuts in its regional hub Hong Kong started on Monday (Feb 17), said the source and another source with knowledge of the matter, and comes ahead of the London-headquartered bank releasing its full-year results on Wednesday.\n\nAt least four managing directors were let go, with three of them based in Hong Kong and one in Singapore, said one of the sources, who declined to be named as the job cuts at the bank were not public.\n\nHSBC declined to comment on the latest round of job cuts in Hong Kong. IFR first reported the layoffs on Monday.\n\nHong Kong-listed shares of HSBC were up 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, underperforming a 2.1 per cent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng index. The shares hit an 11\u00bd year high earlier on Tuesday.\n\nThe investment banking job cuts also come after HSBC last month announced plans to wind down its mergers and acquisitions and some equities businesses in Europe and the Americas in a bid to boost returns.\n\nHSBC\u2019s latest restructuring is being led by its CEO Georges Elhedery, who took the helm in September. He has been taking steps to boost returns and tighten its focus on Asia, where it earns the bulk of its profit.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, the bank said in October that it would combine some of its commercial and investment banking businesses and installed a new leadership structure.\n\nIt also planned to carve up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking.

Details\n\nThe technical summary data tells us to buy HSBC near 52.61, but there is no current upside target from the summary table. In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped. The data does tell us to set a stop loss 52.46 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade. 52.61 is the first level of support below 55.09, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal. In this case, if support 52.61 is being tested, a buy signal would exist. NONE .

All three had been with SGX for over a decade.\n\nThe departure of these long-standing staff members comes amid a wider push by the exchange to bolster its stock market activities, including efforts to double the number of IPOs in the coming years. The bourse\u2019s IPO unit, which had only seven new listings in the last fiscal year, is tasked with increasing the flow of new listings and curbing delistings, a challenge that has raised doubts among some SGX staffers who feel the targets are unrealistic.\n\nEliza Tan, previously in the listing compliance division, will take over Choong\u2019s role as head of IPO admissions. Michael Tang, who heads listing policy and product admission at Singapore Exchange Regulation, is set to succeed Sim in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nIn response to queries, an SGX spokeswoman reassured that the firm is \u201ccontinuously strengthening\u201d its talent pool to ensure future success. She emphasised that the departing team leaves SGX in \u201cvery capable hands.\u201d\n\nDespite these efforts, SGX continues to face difficulties attracting companies to go public. The exchange saw only four IPOs in 2024, raising just $34.4 million, marking the second-lowest amount in over 20 years. Recently, Paragon REIT\u2019s local sponsor proposed taking it private, highlighting the challenges the exchange faces in enticing new listings.\n\nThese staffing changes come at a time when the Singapore government has been exploring various measures to revive the country\u2019s stock market. A recent government-led review group suggested tax incentives for companies and fund managers to encourage local listings and the growth of funds investing in domestic equities. However, some analysts have expressed disappointment with the initial proposals.\n\nSGX shares saw a slump last Friday following the announcement of these proposed measures. The Straits Times Index, however, posted its best performance since 2017 in 2024, driven by strong performances in bank shares. Yet, the lack of liquidity in mid- and small-cap stocks remains a pressing issue, one that the government task force is working to address.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nX\n\n",

A consensus estimate put the quarter-on-quarter growth rate at 1.3% on an annualized basis. But the positive number masks a weakness in household spending amid long-running inflation. Tokyo is expected to continue pressing Japan Inc. to boost workers' pay.\n\nThailand economy\n\nThailand reports GDP figures for 2024 with forecasts pegging growth of 2.6-2.7%, largely supported by a strong recovery in tourism and rebounding exports. However, that estimate is still slightly below the government's target of 3% as high household debt and weak consumption weighed on activity.\n\nSri Lanka budget\n\nSri Lanka's three-month-old government will table its first national budget, as the country faces pressure from the International Monetary Fund to reach a primary fiscal surplus of 2.3 % of GDP and a tax-to-GDP ratio of 14% by next year. The IMF's conditions are part of a $3 billion bailout to help the country recover from its 2022 economic meltdown.\n\nTUESDAY\n\nSouth Korea political crisis\n\nSouth Korea's constitutional court continues hearings this week on whether President Yoon Suk Yeol should be removed from office over his short-lived martial law order in December. That ruling is expected early next month. On Thursday, a Seoul district court will begin Yoon's criminal trial on insurrection charges.\n\nSingapore budget\n\nLawrence Wong, Singapore's prime minister and finance minister, delivers the government's 2025 budget in a critical election year. As a key step in preparing for the city-state's general election due by November, observers are expecting new policies and generous support measures aimed at tackling the most-pressing voter concerns, such as rising living costs.\n\nMonetary policy: Australia\n\nEarnings: Baidu, BHP\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nAtomic agency chief in Fukushima\n\nRafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visits Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on a mission to examine water released into the Pacific Ocean.

The event, organized by Washington-based HFX, aims to \"highlight Taiwan's thriving democracy for global leaders,\" with a series of on- and off-the-record discussions. The conference comes as U.S. President Donald Trump makes a bid for negotiations with Russia to end the Ukraine war, while Taiwan seeks to blunt Trump's criticism of its trade surplus by promising more stateside investment and procurement.\n\nG20 meeting\n\nSouth Africa hosts a meeting of G20 foreign ministers after U.S. President Donald Trump cut financial aid to the country, citing land redistribution policies and its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.

            "content": "SOUTH-EAST ASIA (Bloomberg): HSBC Holdings Plc is kicking off a fresh round of job cuts at its investment bank as new Chief Executive Officer Georges Elhedery continues his overhaul of Europe\u2019s biggest lender, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe latest phase of cuts will start in Asia, but will ultimately affect employees globally, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. It\u2019s not clear how many people will be affected by the moves.\n\nSome cuts are already underway in the firm\u2019s markets division but wider layoffs across the investment bank will begin as early as Monday, the people said.\n\nThe dismissals will be staggered over several weeks and months, one of the people said. Staff will be let go based on performance as well as to remove duplication of jobs or to simplify operations, the person said.\n\n\"As announced on October 2024, HSBC is focused on increasing leadership and market share in the areas where it has a clear competitive advantage and where it has the greatest opportunities to grow,\u201d an HSBC spokesperson said in an emailed response to Bloomberg inquiry.\n\nElhedery is seeking to reduce costs with a restructuring that has so far included combining the commercial banking division with its global banking and markets unit and pulling out of some underwriting and advisory businesses in Europe and the Americas.\n\nSince taking charge in September, Elhedery has already cut the size of his own group executive committee by about a third. Reductions to senior staffers were expected to affect a little over 40% of the company\u2019s top 175 managers, Bloomberg reported in December. The bank has said it expects to complete the moves by June.\n\nHSBC has said it will provide more clarity on the scale of the restructuring when it reports its full-year results on Feb. 19. The bank is forecast by analysts to post pre-tax profit of $31.7 billion for 2024, a 4.6% increase from the previous year. The stock rose 0.5% on Thursday morning in Hong Kong trading to around a seven-year high.\n\nTownhall\n\nThe UK bank\u2019s abrupt retrenchment from equity underwriting and advisory services outside its core markets of Asia and the Middle East has rattled dealmakers in Asia over the past several weeks.\n\nHSBC bankers have been sending a flurry of resumes to headhunters and rivals, people familiar with the matter said. They are concerned that HSBC may lose some businesses such as cross-border M&A advisory from Asia to Europe and the US, and it would be difficult to get a lead role on US listings of Chinese companies.\n\nAt a townhall late last week, veteran dealmaker Matthew Ginsburg, sought to calm concerns among senior bankers in Asia. A key takeaway from the call was that the region is a key focus for Europe\u2019s biggest bank but it would be impacted by changes, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nManagement has been trying to encourage staff\u2019s morale by explaining that HSBC will become more of a boutique dealmaker with a massive balance sheet, the people said. The lender also has strong corporate and institutional bankers with access to large companies in the West, who will help pitch for mandates when these companies do deals in Asia and the Middle East, they said.\n\n--With assistance from Dave Sebastian and Manuel Baigorri. -- \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nHSBC Holdings Insiders Bought Stock Recently\n\nIt's good to see that HSBC Holdings insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Independent Non-Executive Director Brendan Nelson spent UK\u00a3114k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. That shows some optimism about the company's future.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.02% of HSBC Holdings shares, worth about UK\u00a338m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At HSBC Holdings Tell Us?\n\nIt is good to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of HSBC Holdings we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing HSBC Holdings. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with HSBC Holdings (including 1 which is a bit concerning).",

As reported by the Financial Times, the bank is set to unveil $1.5 billion in savings from its transformative restructuring, after accounting for one-time expenses. The announcement will come alongside its 2024 results, set for release on February 19.\n\nHSBC\u2019s New Era Under Fresh Leadership\n\nHSBC Holdings, the largest bank in Europe by assets, is undergoing a major reorganization aimed at cutting costs and enhancing returns. The bank\u2019s CEO, Georges Elhedery, who took the helm in September 2024, is reshaping the bank\u2019s operations in the West to drive returns. Additionally, the bank is intensifying its focus on Asia, the primary source of its profits.\n\nThrough its restructuring, Elhedery aims to build a more agile and streamlined organization. This approach has fueled positive market sentiment and bolstered confidence in the company\u2019s financial health and prospects. Consequently, investor optimism is reflected in HSBC\u2019s stock performance on the NYSE, which has gained 25% since the restructuring announcement in October 2024. Meanwhile, its shares listed in Hong Kong and London have surged around 30% over the past six months.\n\nHSBC Eyes Another Round of Job Cuts\n\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that HSBC is initiating another round of job cuts at its investment bank. The cuts will begin in Asia but are expected to affect staff globally. While the exact number of impacted employees remains unclear, layoffs are set to start as early as Monday. Some reductions are already underway in the firm\u2019s markets division, with broader cuts across the investment bank to follow.\n\nIs HSBC a Good Share to Buy?\n\nAccording to TipRanks consensus, HSBA stock has received a Moderate Buy rating based on five Buy and five Hold recommendations. The HSBC share price target is 866.78p, which is 1% below the current trading level.\n\nSee more HSBA analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Safest Dividend Stocks in the UK. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against other safest dividend stocks in the UK.\n\nIn recent years, investors have increasingly shifted away from UK equities, favoring global stocks, particularly high-growth sectors like US technology. The UK stock market is shrinking at its fastest pace in over a decade, largely due to a wave of takeovers involving London-listed companies. Bloomberg data showed that around 45 firms have been delisted from the London market in 2024 through mergers and acquisitions, reflecting a 10% rise from last year\u2019s total. This marks the highest level of delistings since 2010. At the same time, the value of deals involving UK companies has climbed 81% this year, surpassing $160 billion.\n\nOver the last ten years, the British index has delivered an annual total return of 6%, significantly lagging behind the 13% return of the broader US market. Analysts attribute this weaker performance to sluggish earnings growth, political uncertainty within the UK, and the lack of a dominant technology sector. However, a key factor has been the sharp drop in valuations as investors have increasingly moved away from UK stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, the issue is not a lack of foreign investor interest\u2014who currently account for roughly two-thirds of the UK market capitalization\u2014but rather the low engagement of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nThat said, several factors seem to be contributing to a shift in investor sentiment. In November 2024, UK equity funds saw inflows after more than three years of continuous monthly withdrawals and a large sell-off leading up to the Budget. According to data from Calastone, retail investors invested a net \u00a3317 million into UK-focused stock funds that month. This marks a significant change, halting a streak of 41 months of net outflows, during which over \u00a325 billion had been pulled from these funds since May 2021.\n\nAnalysts also believe that the UK stock market may be on the verge of recovery, although the exact timing and pace of this shift are unclear. In this context, dividend stocks are crucial. Focusing on stocks with growing dividends can offer stability and consistency across different market conditions. These stocks also provide long-term growth potential, compounding returns as share prices recover. The UK market offers some of the highest dividend yields among major markets, with the \u201cFootsie\u201d yielding 3.46%, and the FTSE 250 offering slightly lower but still attractive yields. This setup enables investors to focus on high-growth areas, like smaller companies, while enjoying the benefit of increasing dividends. According to BlackRock, UK market dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, roughly in line with long-term inflation. Companies with growing dividends typically have strong cash flows, allowing them to increase payouts over time.",

(PHOTO / AP)\n\nHSBC Holdings Plc was acquitted by a South Korean court of charges that the bank engaged in illegal short-selling, a blow to the government\u2019s efforts to rein in abuses in the stock trading practice.\n\nIn its ruling Tuesday, the Seoul Southern District Court said there was no evidence that HSBC employees knew of the rule violation before carrying out the trades in question, according to Yonhap.\n\nThe ruling comes after South Korean prosecutors investigated and indicted the bank and three traders at HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong unit in March on allegations of conducting naked short selling \u2014 a practice of selling shares without securing them first \u2014 amounting to about 15.8 billion won ($10.9 million).\n\nALSO READ: Banking giant HSBC sued by Australian regulator over failure to protect scam victims\n\nThe case, closely watched by overseas investors, resulted in what the local media reported to be the first indictment against a foreign bank on charges related to naked short selling. HSBC has previously argued that the Korean prosecutors\u2019 approach was \u201carbitrary\u201d and the verdict likely reassures foreign investors who are calling for loosening of stock trading rules in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with today\u2019s decision in favor of HSBC,\u201d an HSBC spokesperson said in an email statement. \u201cThere was no intention to breach any Korean short selling regulations and we are looking forward to putting this matter behind us.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: HSBC merges commercial and investment banking units, names first female CFO\n\nKorean regulators plan to lift in March a temporary ban on short-selling. But they plan to keep the ban on naked short-selling, responding to retail investors and others who say the tactic renders unfair advantages to foreign institutional investors. The practice is \u201crampant,\u201d they said.\n\nIn pursuing its case against HSBC, the prosecutors\u2019 office sought to fine the bank 300 million won.\n\nREAD MORE: HSBC shares rise on $3b buyback; flat first-half profit beats estimates\n\nIn March, the bank had acknowledged \u201cunintentional breaches\u201d of the Korean short selling regulations, and said it took fast remedial action to address them and paid $5.6 million in fine. But the bank also said in the statement then that indicting HSBC and individuals was unwarranted and disproportionate to the local regulatory findings.\n\nIn October, South Korean prosecutors also indicted BNP Paribas SA for allegedly violating short-selling rules. The Securities and Futures Commission also fined in December Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc. 13.7 billion won and 4.7 billion won, respectively, for alleged naked short selling.\n\nLifting the short selling ban, which has been in place since November 2023, would help remove one of the barriers in Korea\u2019s bid for a market upgrade from index operator MSCI, Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Byoung-hwan said in September.",

A ban has been imposed since November 2023 after authorities found illegal naked short selling by foreign investment banks.\n\nSouth Korea plans to lift a market-wide ban on stock short-selling in March, when it is expected to have a system ready to detect illegal trades.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunsu Yim and Jihoon Lee; Editing by Ed Davies)",

He is also entitled to an annual incentive worth a maximum of 215 per cent of his base salary and a long-term award worth as much as 320 per cent of his salary. Together with a pension allowance, his package is valued at a maximum of about \u00a310.6 million a year.\n\nThe London-headquartered bank could hand Elhedery a package worth as much as \u00a315 million under a fresh plan that is being discussed, a person familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified before a public announcement. Sky News first reported the details of the new awards. While his fixed pay would be roughly half what it currently is, his potential bonus would be much higher, the person said.\n\nGroup CEO Georges Elhedery, seen at the Global Financial Leaders\u2019 Investment Summit in Hong Kong in November 2024.

Political developments, risk appetite, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical risks also impact the market. Retail forex trading, international transactions, and currency exchange services are accessible to individuals and small businesses through modern technology and trading platforms. Central banks, monetary policies, regulations, and inflation are key factors affecting Forex rates. Major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY have high trading volume, with interbank networks and electronic platforms ensuring efficiency in 24-hour operations. Corporates, hedge funds, wealth managers, and foreign exchange services offer advisory services, trading programs, and remittance services to meet diverse needs. Globalization of businesses, GDP growth, investor confidence, liquidity, and economic events influence Forex market dynamics. Financial crises and strategic corporate activities also impact the market, with hedging strategies providing risk management solutions.

The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 10.6% during the forecast period. Growing urbanization and digitalization is driving market growth, with a trend towards 24x7 trading opportunities for foreign exchange. However, uncertainty of future exchange rates poses a challenge. Key market players include Bank of America Corp., Barclays PLC, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, DBS Bank Ltd, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase and Co., London Stock Exchange Group plc, NatWest Group plc, Societe Generale SA, Standard Chartered PLC, State Street Corp., The Bank of Nova Scotia, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS Group AG, and XTX Markets Ltd..\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe foreign exchange market operates continuously, providing traders with the opportunity to buy and sell currencies around the clock. This is due to the fact that trades are facilitated through a network of computers and various international time zones. The New York market closing does not halt foreign exchange trading as other markets in different parts of the world remain open. Consequently, when the USD's closing rate is reported, it signifies the exchange rate at the New York market's closing time. Money transactions continue globally beyond the New York market's hours, making the foreign exchange market a dynamic, non-stop marketplace.\n\nRequest Sample of our comprehensive report now to stay ahead in the AI-driven market evolution!\n\nMarket Challenges\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Market, also known as Forex, is a global market where Currencies are bought and sold. It's a significant part of the Foreign Securities Market, involving Financial Institutions, Non-Financial Customers, and various other players like Individuals, Retailers, Corporate Institutes, and Hedge Funds. International Trade, Interest Rate Differentials, Monetary Interventions, Speculation, Investment Flows, and Economic Indicators influence Forex rates. Political Developments, Risk Appetite, Inflationary Pressures, Retail Forex Trading, and International Transactions are also crucial factors. Modern Technology, Globalization of Businesses, and 24-hour Operation make Forex accessible to Individual Investors, Small Businesses, and Multinational Corporations dealing with Major Currency Pairs. Currency Swaps, Monetary Policies, Regulations, and Central Banks play a crucial role in maintaining Liquidity and Stability. However, challenges like Terrorism Threats, Geopolitical Risks, and Financial Crises can impact Forex trading significantly. Currency Exchange Services, Remittance Services, and Trading Programs help facilitate these transactions efficiently.\n\nIn foreign trading, the exchange rate uncertainty poses a significant risk. When a deal is finalized, the value of the currencies involved may change before payment is received. For instance, if a buyer agrees to pay USD525,935 for a shipment based on an exchange rate of USD0.85 per Euro, the seller expects to collect \u20ac600,000. However, if the Euro depreciates to USD0.84, the seller will only receive \u20ac592,000, resulting in a USD8,000 loss. To mitigate this risk, traders employ various hedging strategies or lock in exchange rates at the time of transaction.\n\nDiscover how AI is revolutionizing market trends- Get your access now!\n\nSegment Overview\n\nThis foreign exchange market report extensively covers market segmentation by\n\nType\n\nTrade Finance Instruments\n\nGeography\n\nCounterparty\n\n1.1 Reporting dealers- The foreign exchange market is a crucial financial market where participating institutions hold risky inventory positions during the maturity period.

Market growth is expected as dealers with informational advantages minimize liquidity risks.

Sky News first reported the details of the new awards.\n\nElhedery currently receives a base salary of \u00a31.38 million as well as an additional fixed pay allowance worth \u00a31.7 million. On top of this, he is entitled to an annual incentive worth a maximum of 215 percent of his base salary and a long-term award worth as much as 320 percent of his salary. Together with a pension allowance, Elhedery\u2019s current package is valued at a maximum of about \u00a310.6 million a year.\n\n\u201cWhile no decisions have been taken, the remuneration committee\u2019s objective is for the pay outcomes for our executive directors to be strongly aligned with performance and shareholders\u2019 interests,\u201d a representative for HSBC said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe lender will publish details of the compensation along with its year-end results on Feb. 19, according to the statement.\n\nBritain had earlier effectively limited banker bonus payments to twice the base salary, in line with European Union caps first introduced in 2014 in response to public outcry over the global financial crisis. In late 2023, UK officials removed those curbs as part of a broader push to make post-Brexit Britain more attractive as a financial center.\n\nMany other banks operating in the UK, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been ditching those limits and overhauling executive pay after the rule changes.\n\nBLOOMBERG",

For starters, the bank serves over 14 million customers in the UK,\n\nHowever, countless Brits are clueless about what the acronym stands for. The banking giant, established in 1865, boasts a global presence with branches and subsidiaries in 62 countries, spanning continents from Europe to Africa.\n\nDespite its prominence, the meaning behind HSBC's name has left some customers scratching their heads, leading to a flurry of queries on Quora. Social media users have been asking: \"What is the full form of HSBC?\" It turns out the acronym stands for The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\n\nIt might seem odd for a UK-based bank to carry such a title, but there's historical significance. In the 1840s, as Britain made Hong Kong a crown colony.\n\nHSBC's founder Thomas Sutherland, associated with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, decided to establish a bank grounded in \"sound Scottish banking principles\" in Hong Kong's Wardley House.\n\nWith an initial capital stock of HK$5 million, Sutherland launched operations in Shanghai and amalgamated the two locations under The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation banner. Now, HSBC calls Canary Wharf in London its home, operating 327 branches across England and Wales.\n\nOne Quora user explained the evolution of HSBC's identity, stating: \"Before 1998 the HSBC Group comprised a number of companies including Midland Bank in the UK. HSBC Group rebranded all of those companies in 1998 under 'HSBC + Hexagon'. It stated in its brand documents that while the abbreviation HSBC was derived from one of the companies In the Group (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited) that going forward HSBC did not stand for any one company so it does not stand for anything.\"\n\nThey further noted: \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation remains one of the companies under the HSBC Group brand. That company is abbreviated to 'HBAP' internally. However there remain many other entities under 'HSBC +Hexagon' brand that are not called The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another user chimed in with a bit of history, writing: \"The origins of the bank lie mainly in Hong Kong and to a lesser extent in Shanghai, where branches were first opened in 1865. The HSBC name is derived from the initials of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The company was first formally incorporated in 1866.\"",

            "content": "My path to banking wasn\u2019t one I expected to take, but looking back, it makes perfect sense. In my sophomore year of college, I realized how quickly time passes, and I had to think about my career. With an economics degree in hand, banking seemed like a natural choice, but there was one major question: What kind of banking did I want to pursue?\n\nI quickly realized that I wanted more than just sitting behind an Excel spreadsheet. For some, the role of financial analyst, building and developing products for clients, is a perfect fit. I respect that role immensely. But for me, I craved the immediacy of face-to-face client relationships \u2013 being part of the action and seeing the direct impact of my work. Private banking, with its client-centric approach, felt like the ideal path.\n\nThriving in a global bank\n\nHSBC stood out to me not just because of its reputation, but because of its international focus, especially in the US market. The bank is deliberately expanding its reach, and that excited me. However, as a Black man entering the world of finance, I won\u2019t lie, I had my doubts at first.\n\nThe industry can feel daunting, but HSBC\u2019s inclusive culture has helped me thrive. From the outset, I felt supported and welcomed. The bank has worked hard to foster an environment that values diversity, as evidenced by its partnerships with historically Black colleges, creating internship opportunities and nurturing talent.\n\nTrust and confidentiality\n\nIn my 18 months at HSBC, I\u2019ve learned the importance of taking initiative. A phrase like \u201cCan I sit in on that?\u201d has opened doors to invaluable learning opportunities. I\u2019ve had the privilege of being involved in confidential client conversations \u2013 everything from wealth planning to sensitive matters like debt management and estate planning. These moments are not just opportunities to learn; they\u2019re moments of trust, where clients share their most personal financial details. I take that responsibility very seriously and strive to treat every interaction with the utmost respect and confidentiality.",

            "content": "The Federal Reserve kept rates steady last week, citing the struggle against last-mile inflation and the potential of tariff shocks to influence prices. While Chairman Jerome Powell's news conference was relatively low key, it did contain notes of uncertainty and traders are betting that a March rate cut could be out of the picture.\n\nMarkets would still prefer lower rates, but steady rates combined with a deregulatory push from the new administration could benefit one sector in particular \u2014 banks.\n\nThe banking sector has posted significant gains since the November election results and if rates and tariffs are creating uncertainty, bank stocks could be a safe haven until markets have more clarity \u2014 and earn you some dividends income while you wait.\n\nHere are the four bank stocks to buy for the tariff and interest rate uncertainty.\n\nFor banks, it's crucial to focus on certain fundamental metrics to find favorable stocks. If you're buying bank stocks based on regulatory tailwinds, using technical indicators like moving averages or momentum oscillators may align with long-term holding timeframes.\n\nInstead, factors like Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio and Return on Equity (ROE) provide better clues. Additionally, net interest margin (NIM) is a crucial bank profitability metric since it measures the difference between interest paid on deposits and interest received on loans. NIM tends to decline when rates rise as lending conditions tighten, fewer loans are issued, and customer deposits earn higher interest. But when rates stay flat or decline, banking activity picks up, and NIM can grow.\n\nA \u2018good' NIM can fluctuate based on the size of the bank and the types of loans issued, but a bank with a negative NIM during a flat or declining rate environment could be in trouble.\n\nFor our selections here, we selected bank stocks showing a P/B ratio between 1.00 and 2.00, ROE above 9%, and NIM above the industry average of 3%.\n\nBank of America BAC\n\nOne of the oldest and biggest banks in America also has one of the most appealing stocks entering 2025. Bank of America gained more than 30% in 2024 and based on recent numbers, that momentum could continue. BAC has a $352 billion market cap and operates in all 50 states, specializing in personal and commercial banking, plus investment management, mortgage and brokerage services, wealth management, and a variety of market-making and lending operations.\n\nBAC suffered a nearly 25% decline in July 2024, but has rebounded in the last few month and recently made a new all-time high, surpassing the previous mark of $46.31 set in January 2022. Bank of America currently has a 1.31 P/B value and a 9.2% ROE, with a forward P/E ratio of 10.65 and a dividend yield of 2.35%. BAC received two Buy ratings from Morgan Stanley and Opperheimer in January, along with a Hold reiteration from Piper Sandler. The average price target from these three is $53, indicating a potential upside of 15% from the January 31 closing price of $46.25.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group GS\n\nGoldman Sachs has dabbled in consumer banking, but its true focus in investment banking, wealth management, and market making. Goldman is one of the more prestigious Wall Street banks, serving individual, corporate, institutional, and governmental clients. The company currently has a $200 billion market cap and employs over 46,000 people.\n\nGS shares are up nearly 70% over the last 12 months, thanks in large part to significant revenue growth. The company has grown quarterly revenue 7.5% year-over-year, far surpassing our other bank stock picks and pushing the stock to new all-time highs at $650 per share. Goldman Sachs has a 1.88 P/B value and 12.4 forward P/E, indicating a slightly-elevated value, but the 12% ROE should assuage investors. The stock pays a 1.96% dividend yield and received two reiterated Buy ratings on January 16 from Morgan Stanley and Barclays with $782 and $760 respective price targets.\n\n[GET A CHARTER MEMBER DISCOUNT TO \u2018BENZINGA TRADE ALERTS'- 200 SPOTS ONLY]\n\nHSBC Holdings plc HSBC\n\nWe're heading across the pond for our next stock selection to London's HSBC Holdings, one of the largest and oldest banks in England (you might be sensing a theme). HSBC operates in three banking segments: Personal, Commercial, and Global and Markets. The bank has a $187 billion market cap and pays a handsome 7.95% dividend yield.\n\nThe Bank of England currently has its prime rate set higher than the Federal Funds rate, but the institution is expected to drop that rate to 4.5% in the coming weeks. Falling rates aren't always good news for banks, but HSBC is positioned to absorb any shock thanks to 6.8% quarterly year-over-year revenue growth. The stock has a 0.99 P/B value and its current ROE is over 12%. The forward P/E of 8.36 also indicates an undervalued security.\n\nBank of New York Mellon Co BK\n\nBank of New York Mellon is the smallest entry on our list with a market cap of just over $17 billion. But while it lacks in size (at least compared to the heavy hitters listed above), its stock packs a punch. The bank was founded in New York City in 1784 and specializes in investment banking and wealth management, and offers its own securities through ETFs and mutual funds. Despite the smaller market cap, the company actually has more employees than Goldman with 52,000 full-time staff.\n\nBK stock is already up 12% year-to-date after gaining more than 40% in 2024. In terms of valuation metrics, BK looks like Baby Bear's porridge \u2014 just right. The bank sports a 1.55 P/B value, right in between our guideline of 1% to 2%. It also tops 11% ROE and has a forward P/E of 11.3. While Bank of New York Mellon doesn't get the recognition of a Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase, its been offering quality investment management services for nearly 150 years, and its stock has a promising outlook in 2025. Plus, the dividend yield is nearly 15% higher than what Goldman is offering.\n\nSecure your discounted charter membership to the new \u2018Benzinga Trade Alerts'- before Monday\u2019s public launch.

Financial institutions and non-financial customers, including individuals, retailers, corporate institutes, and multinational corporations, participate in this market for various reasons. Currency swaps, international trade, interest rate differentials, monetary interventions, speculation, investment flows, and economic indicators are some of the trends influencing Forex. Political developments, risk appetite, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical risks also impact the market. Retail forex trading, international transactions, and currency exchange services are accessible to individuals and small businesses through modern technology and trading platforms. Central banks, monetary policies, regulations, and inflation are key factors affecting Forex rates. Major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY have high trading volume, with interbank networks and electronic platforms ensuring efficiency in 24-hour operations. Corporates, hedge funds, wealth managers, and foreign exchange services offer advisory services, trading programs, and remittance services to meet diverse needs. Globalization of businesses, GDP growth, investor confidence, liquidity, and economic events influence Forex market dynamics. Financial crises and strategic corporate activities also impact the market, with hedging strategies providing risk management solutions. Personal finance, global commerce, international travel, and online shopping are some areas where Forex plays a crucial role.\n\nThe foreign exchange market operates continuously, providing traders with the opportunity to buy and sell currencies around the clock. This is due to the fact that trades are facilitated through a network of computers and various international time zones. The New York market closing does not halt foreign exchange trading as other markets in different parts of the world remain open. Consequently, when the USD's closing rate is reported, it signifies the exchange rate at the New York market's closing time. Money transactions continue globally beyond the New York market's hours, making the foreign exchange market a dynamic, non-stop marketplace.\n\nRequest Sample of our comprehensive report now to stay ahead in the AI-driven market evolution!\n\nMarket Challenges\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Market, also known as Forex, is a global market where Currencies are bought and sold. It's a significant part of the Foreign Securities Market, involving Financial Institutions, Non-Financial Customers, and various other players like Individuals, Retailers, Corporate Institutes, and Hedge Funds. International Trade, Interest Rate Differentials, Monetary Interventions, Speculation, Investment Flows, and Economic Indicators influence Forex rates. Political Developments, Risk Appetite, Inflationary Pressures, Retail Forex Trading, and International Transactions are also crucial factors. Modern Technology, Globalization of Businesses, and 24-hour Operation make Forex accessible to Individual Investors, Small Businesses, and Multinational Corporations dealing with Major Currency Pairs. Currency Swaps, Monetary Policies, Regulations, and Central Banks play a crucial role in maintaining Liquidity and Stability. However, challenges like Terrorism Threats, Geopolitical Risks, and Financial Crises can impact Forex trading significantly. Currency Exchange Services, Remittance Services, and Trading Programs help facilitate these transactions efficiently.\n\nIn foreign trading, the exchange rate uncertainty poses a significant risk. When a deal is finalized, the value of the currencies involved may change before payment is received. For instance, if a buyer agrees to pay USD525,935 for a shipment based on an exchange rate of USD0.85 per Euro, the seller expects to collect \u20ac600,000. However, if the Euro depreciates to USD0.84 , the seller will only receive \u20ac592,000, resulting in a USD8,000 loss. To mitigate this risk, traders employ various hedging strategies or lock in exchange rates at the time of transaction.\n\nDiscover how AI is revolutionizing market trends- Get your access now!\n\nSegment Overview\n\nThis foreign exchange market report extensively covers market segmentation by\n\nType\n\nReporting Dealers\n\n\n\nFinancial Institutions\n\n\n\nNon-financial Customers\n\nTrade Finance Instruments\n\nCurrency Swaps\n\n\n\nOutright Forward And FX Swaps\n\n\n\nFX Options\n\nGeography\n\nNorth America\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\nAPAC\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\n\nMiddle East And Africa\n\nCounterparty\n\nReporting Dealers\n\n\n\nOther Financial Institutions\n\n\n\nNon-Financial Customers\n\n1.1 Reporting dealers- The foreign exchange market is a crucial financial market where participating institutions hold risky inventory positions during the maturity period.

Liquidity is essential due to dispersed trading and the need for immediacy, with reporting dealers providing accurate information on future currency movements based on order flow. Market growth is expected as dealers with informational advantages minimize liquidity risks.

            "content": "European Banks Face Job Cuts Amid Restructuring Major lenders reassess strategies as competition with U.S. banks escalates.\n\nThe start of the year is typically when Europe\u2019s financial sector buzzes with anticipation over annual bonuses. Yet as we move through 2025, unease fills the air, with some bankers beginning to worry about their job security. Signals of significant job cuts have emerged from major financial institutions, underscoring the precarious state of European banking.\n\nOn Thursday, Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, issued stark warnings to his employees, announcing intentions to reduce headcount, including management roles. \"2025 will be the year of reckoning,\" Sewing declared, adding ominously, \"nothing is off limits\" as he eyes restructuring efforts aimed toward improving profitability.\n\nHSBC Holdings is following suit, with CEO Georges Elhedery indicating plans to scale back its investment banking operations significantly across Europe and the U.S. The bank's plans reflect serious changes aimed at realigning its priorities and financial strategies. Since Elhedery took over just five months ago, he has made it clear he intends to reshape the British lender's identity, saying, \"Going forward we will focus on areas where we can best serve our corporate and institutional clients,\" stated Michael Roberts, who oversees corporate and institutional banking.\n\nEven the traditionally resilient Swiss private banking sector is not immune. UBS Group is cutting hundreds of employees domestically as part of the integration process with Credit Suisse, which UBS acquired during its emergency rescue two years prior. CEO Sergio Ermotti made it clear this month, pointing to the additional costs savings following the merger after UBS has already shed $7.5 billion since then.\n\nWhile UBS is gearing up for more reorganizations, Julius Baer Group also plans to announce extensive job reductions over the next two years. The craftsmanship of their strategy will see shifts across various divisions, including significant downsizing of its executive board. Under CEO Stefan Bollinger, the Zurich-based wealth manager is on track to finalize reforms initiated following financial losses from the now-defunct Signa real estate dealings.\n\nDespite the disheartening news, not all is bleak for Europe\u2019s banks. Some institutions are preparing to increase bonuses this year as they manage to retain profitable segments of their operations. Reports indicate Deutsche Bank is considering as much as a 10% bonus hike for its investment bankers, with BNP Paribas forecasting similar growth of up to 5%. Barclays, too, hints at possibly boosting bonuses by as much as 20% as traders and advisory teams show improved performance from the previous year.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand why these restructuring efforts are happening now. The European banking sector faces stiff competition from their U.S. counterparts, whose financial performance often puts European firms to shame. Recently, JPMorgan Chase announced record profits, chalking up the success to favorable market conditions back home, which starkly contrasts with the stagnant growth across the European Union. Financial analysts note, \"It\u2019s a reflection of how European banks have struggled to compete with their U.S. peers since the global financial crisis,\" highlighting the discrepancy between the two regions.\n\nThe urgency to revamp operations likely stems from the incoming pro-business policies of the Trump administration, which could intensify competitive pressure on European lenders. Analysts predict, as John Cronin of SeaPoint Insights noted, \"If anything, the top five U.S. banks will become relatively stronger over the coming years,\" due to this shifting geopolitical and economic environment.\n\nElhedery of HSBC is shifting away from the ambition of rivaling Wall Street, focusing instead on where profits can be maximized. Their renewed focus will see the bank strengthen its foothold in Asia, especially China and Hong Kong, and the Middle East. \"I don\u2019t think this is about having to make a difficult choice between serving China versus serving the West - it\u2019s about cold hard commercial facts,\" argues Alex Marshall, managing partner at CIL, underlining the necessity for banks to adapt pragmatically to global financial flows.\n\nThese sweeping changes make it evident how these banking institutions are redoubling their efforts as they confront the challenges head-on, seeking stability amid mounting external pressures.\n\nWhile questions loom about job security and operational strategies across the industry, it is clear adaptation becomes necessary for survival and growth. The evolution of European banks will be watched closely as they strive to emerge stronger from this episode of significant restructuring.",

            "content": "Image source: Getty Images\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at the outlook for dividend stocks in 2025, and it has to depend a fair bit on how total 2024 dividends turn out. And that picture looks a bit mixed.\n\nAccording to the most recent Dividend Dashboard from AJ Bell, analysts expect a total of \u00a378.5bn in FTSE 100 dividends for 2024. And that should be backed by total pre-tax profit for the index coming close to beating the all-time record set in 2022.\n\nBut against that, forecasts suggest almost no dividend gain over 2023. And cover by earnings looks likely to drop. There are some big dividend yields on the cards. But there must be fears they could come under pressure.\n\nOptimism ahead\n\nAt least the City expects dividends and cover to both rise in 2025, but I\u2019m wary of such an early prognosis. Every year for the past few years, these surveys have shown optimism at the start. But estimates keep being scaled back as each year progresses.\n\nI can\u2019t help thinking our dividend focus could do well to shift towards a bit more safety this year. We need to keep an eye on those earnings. So which dividend stocks do I think we should consider as potentially safer buys in 2025?\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards HSBC Holdings (LSE: HSBA) for one, even though its share price has gained close to 50% in the past five years.\n\nCovered high yield\n\nDespite the rise, we\u2019re still looking at an estimated dividend yield of 5.8% for the year ended December. And, importantly if we think payout pressure might emerge in 2025, forecasts put cover by earnings at 2.1 times.\n\nThe bank\u2019s exposure to China looks like the biggest risk, with its economy struggling to grow. And who knows what any international trade war may bring?\n\nBut in a Q3 update, CEO Georges Elhedery announced \u201ca further $4.8bn of distributions in respect of the third quarter, which bring the total distributions announced so far in 2024 to $18.4bn.\u201c\n\nWe\u2019re looking at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only eight. And forecasts suggest dividend growth in the years ahead.\n\nReal estate investor\n\nLooking for other 2024 final dividends expected to be strongly supported, I see Land Securities with predicted cover of 1.7 times. It\u2019s a real estate investment trust (REIT) that operates offices, shopping centres, and retail parks\n\nWeak property sentiment might hold the share price back until we see the next bull market. And we might need the economy to brighten. But the expected 6.9% dividend puts it firmly on my consideration list.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future.

Learn More .\n\nThere have been some big FTSE 100 index winners over the last 12 months. The UK large-cap index has gained 13.7%, rising to 8,673 points as I write on 31 January.\n\nOne of the strongest sectors over that period has been financial services. A high interest rate environment has helped increase net interest income for the banks and boosted share prices.\n\nNatWest (LSE: NWG) is one such stock. Its share price has rocketed 92.9% higher over the past year to \u00a34.34 per share on 31 January.\n\nI wanted to explore what\u2019s driving the company\u2019s market cap higher and evaluate where it sits among its UK banking peers.\n\nBumper year for banking stocks\n\nWhile the Bank of England has begun cutting rates, all indications are that the US Federal Reserve and other central banks will be slower than expected in cutting rates. High interest rates have increased bank revenues, while loan defaults have remained subdued, boosting net interest income.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, NatWest outperformed analyst estimates by reporting a 25.7% increase in pre-tax operating profit to \u00a31.7bn.\n\nBank revenues increased to \u00a33.8bn as management upgraded its annual return on tangible equity (ROTE) forecast to over 14%. Additionally, deposits grew by \u00a32.2bn, and lending increased by \u00a38.4bn during the quarter, which all helped boost the company\u2019s share price higher.\n\nIt was a similar story for many of the other UK banks. Barclays (LSE: BARC) has gained 100% to \u00a32.98 per share, and HSBC (LSE: HSBA) gained 37% to \u00a38.48 per share, to 31 January.\n\nValuation\n\nI thought I\u2019d take a look at some common valuation metrics. The first one is the price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which measures a company\u2019s market cap against the net book value of its assets held on the balance sheet.\n\nNatWest\u2019s P/B ratio of 0.93 is fairly comparable to HSBC\u2019s ratio of 1, while Barclays appears the most undervalued. Bear in mind, though, Barclays is undergoing significant change at the moment with \u00a310bn capital forecast to be returned to shareholders and focusing on a smaller investment banking division.\n\nNatWest\u2019s dividend yield of 4% sits neatly in the middle of Barclays (2.8%) and HSBC (5.7%). I do think the HSBC dividend is one to be a touch wary of given the transformation underway at the bank.\n\nNatWest currently has a 9.1 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is marginally higher than HSBC\u2019s 8.8 times multiple. Barclays, after its strong recent gains, is trading at a P/E ratio of 11.9 times and looks a touch expensive.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe relative valuation metrics above present something of a mixed bag. All in all, I feel as though NatWest is undergoing perhaps the least change among the three banks discussed.\n\nThat could work in its favour by doing more of the same and continuing to grow its book, while its peers look to fundamentally transform their businesses. I\u2019m not looking to add these banking stocks to my portfolio right now, but Barclays is the one that I think is most worth considering among the UK bank stocks.\n\nWhile the bank has a long transformation journey ahead, I think it is showing promising signs of it working, and the potential growth trajectory may justify a higher P/E ratio.",

            "content": "London stocks had extended gains by midday on Friday, with Smiths Group pacing the gains on break-up plans, as investors mulled house price data from Nationwide and eyed the latest US inflation reading.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was up 0.4% at 8,677.81.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"The FTSE 100 marked new record highs on Friday morning, taking its cues from solid trading on Wall Street as the recovery from Monday\u2019s DeepSeek related volatility continued.\n\n\"Defence and energy names were among those giving the UK\u2019s flagship index an end-of-week boost.\n\n\"Investors will be relieved that the markets have successfully negotiated a week full of major events including a Federal Reserve interest rate meeting and the start of the Magnificent Seven earnings season.\n\n\"Later on, there\u2019s one more hurdle to get over this week as core PCE inflation data is released in the US. This metric is a big factor in informing the decision making of the Fed so a surprise in either direction could make markets increasingly febrile again.\"\n\nThe PCE figures are due at 1330 GMT.\n\nOn home shores, data from Nationwide showed that growth in house prices eased in January.\n\nHouse prices ticked up 0.1% on the month in January following a 0.7% increase in December 2024, missing expectations for 0.3% growth. On the year, house prices rose 4.1% in January following a 4.7% jump the month before.\n\nThe average price of a home was \u00a3268,213, down from \u00a3269,426.\n\nNationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said: \"The housing market continues to show resilience despite ongoing affordability pressures. As we highlighted in our recent affordability report, while there has been a modest improvement over the last year, affordability remains stretched by historic standards.\n\n\"A prospective buyer earning the average UK income and buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 36% of their take-home pay - well above the long-run average of 30%.\n\n\"Furthermore, house prices remain high relative to average earnings, with the first-time buyer house price to earnings ratio standing at 5.0 at the end of 2024, still well above the long run average of 3.9. Consequently, the deposit hurdle remains high.\n\n\"This is a challenge that has been made worse by the record increase in rents in recent years, which, together with the cost-of-living crisis more generally, has hampered the ability of many in the private rented sector to save.\"\n\nIn equity markets, engineering business Smiths Group surged as it said it was selling its interconnect unit and planned to demerge or offload the detection operation as part of a strategic review that includes extending its share buyback to \u00a3500m.\n\nSmiths added that the recent cyber attack was limited to internal enterprise systems, and it had \"made good progress in the recovery of these, with most critical systems being back online\".\n\nFashion and homeware retailer Next jumped after an upgrade to \u2018buy\u2019 from \u2018neutral\u2019 at UBS, which said the company was at an \"inflection point\" when it comes to growth and valuation. The target price was lifted to 11,700p from 10,500p.\n\nMoonpig was also a high riser as Berenberg reiterated its 'buy' rating on shares of the online greeting cards and gift retailer.\n\nOn the downside, Sainsbury\u2019s fell after a downgrade to \u2018hold\u2019 by HSBC, while Admiral dipped after a downgrade to \u2018reduce\u2019 by Peel Hunt.\n\nMarket Movers\n\nFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,677.81 0.36%\n\nFTSE 250 (MCX) 20,895.40 0.43%\n\ntechMARK (TASX) 4,766.54 0.45%\n\nFTSE 100 - Risers\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN) 2,076.00p 11.31%\n\nNext (NXT) 10,020.00p 2.50%\n\nSt James's Place (STJ) 1,055.00p 2.43%\n\nSmurfit Westrock (DI) (SWR) 4,304.00p 1.89%\n\nRolls-Royce Holdings (RR.) 606.00p 1.68%\n\nBAE Systems (BA.) 1,228.50p 1.65%\n\nEntain (ENT) 711.20p 1.51%\n\nMondi (MNDI) 1,249.50p 1.34%\n\nScottish Mortgage Inv Trust (SMT) 1,084.50p 1.17%\n\nJD Sports Fashion (JD.) 88.18p 1.15%\n\nFTSE 100 - Fallers\n\nSmith (DS) (SMDS) 579.00p -1.61%\n\nFresnillo (FRES) 702.50p -1.40%\n\nSainsbury (J) (SBRY) 254.60p -1.39%\n\nSEGRO (SGRO) 713.60p -1.08%\n\nHaleon (HLN) 372.20p -0.93%\n\nPrudential (PRU) 683.00p -0.84%\n\nGames Workshop Group (GAW) 14,510.00p -0.75%\n\nConvatec Group (CTEC) 247.80p -0.64%\n\nBT Group (BT.A) 142.80p -0.59%\n\nWhitbread (WTB) 2,833.00p -0.56%\n\nFTSE 250 - Risers\n\nBridgepoint Group (Reg S) (BPT) 378.40p 5.29%\n\nOSB Group (OSB) 419.60p 3.96%\n\nParagon Banking Group (PAG) 793.00p 3.52%\n\nMoonpig Group (MOON) 226.00p 3.43%\n\nPennon Group (PNN) 599.00p 3.01%\n\nBakkavor Group (BAKK) 136.00p 2.64%\n\nQinetiQ Group (QQ.) 371.00p 2.26%\n\nDiversified Energy Company (DEC) 1,344.00p 2.05%\n\nSpirent Communications (SPT) 184.40p 1.60%\n\nDiscoverie Group (DSCV) 651.00p 1.56%\n\nFTSE 250 - Fallers\n\nFuture (FUTR) 911.50p -1.62%\n\nSyncona Limited NPV (SYNC) 95.40p -1.55%\n\nInvestec (INVP) 518.50p -1.52%\n\nTrainline (TRN) 363.40p -1.25%\n\nHochschild Mining (HOC) 178.20p -0.89%\n\nDomino's Pizza Group (DOM) 300.20p -0.86%\n\nVietnam Enterprise Investments (DI) (VEIL) 602.00p -0.82%\n\nVictrex plc (VCT) 992.00p -0.80%\n\nJohnson Matthey (JMAT) 1,421.00p -0.77%\n\nPantheon International (PIN) 323.50p -0.77%",

            "content": "Investors should never discount the power of buying stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with strong dividends that can deliver years of steady and growing passive income. ETFs typically offer an added layer of diversity because they purchase a basket of stocks. Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest investor of all time, has said that some of his biggest winners haven't come from pure stock price appreciation, but stocks that he's held for 30 years and that have consistently grown their dividends such as Coca-Cola and American Express. Investors can take a page out of Buffett's book and invest $50,000 evenly in these three Vanguard ETFs, which could generate nearly $2,000 of passive income every year.\n\nVanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF -- 4.68% yield\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nThe Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF (NASDAQ: VYMI) seeks to help investors gain exposure to a basket of international stocks with above-average dividend yields. The fund has only returned 11% over the last five years, which is poor compared to the broader market. U.S. stocks have been king in recent years and international stocks have been out of favor, so it's not overly surprising to see this performance. Here are the top 10 stocks in the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF by weighting.\n\nToyota Motor -- 1.75% Nestle SA -- 1.63% Roche Holdings -- 1.55% Novartis -- 1.51% Shell -- 1.50% HSBC Holdings -- 1.38% Royal Bank of Canada -- 1.32% Commonwealth Bank of Australia -- 1.23% Siemens AG -- 1.12% Unilever -- 1.08%\n\nIt's not surprising to see a lot of bank stocks in here, most of which haven't partaken in the two-year bull market. However, that could soon change with the yield curve steepening as longer-date Treasury notes and bonds yield more than shorter-duration ones. This is when bank stocks tend to perform well. Furthermore, some believe that with U.S. stocks looking expensive it might be time to shift into international waters. Fidelity in a note recently said that while the U.S. economy may grow faster near-term, many international markets are likely to expand more longer-term. Several international economies have struggled but may soon be nearing an inflection point. Since launching, this index fund's dividend yield has bounced around a bit but grown nicely since inception and more than doubled in yield.\n\nVanguard Real Estate ETF -- 3.77% yield\n\nReal estate stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs) usually pay nice dividends, so it's not surprising to see the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) yielding a healthy 3.77%. The ETF largely invests in REITs that buy many different types of properties. The fund's purpose is to generate passive income, so it's not surprising to see that returns have been paltry over the last five and 10 years. REITs pay out more than 90% of their income in dividends. Here are the top 10 holdings in the fund:\n\nVanguard Real Estate II Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares -- 13.94% Prologis -- 5.84% Equinix -- 5.19% American Tower -- 5.11% Welltower -- 4.55% Digital Realty Trust -- 3.46% Simon Property Group -- 3.35% Public Storage -- 2.81% Realty Income -- 2.77% CBRE Group Inc. Class A -- 2.40%\n\nThere's been a lot of concern about commercial real estate. First, investors grew very concerned about hotels and retail businesses amid the pandemic because the world began to live more of its life at home. Those concerns eventually dissipated some and shifted to office space, which has struggled since the work-from-home boom began. This ETF's largest concentration (13.8%) is in retail REITs, while other big categories include healthcare (11.8%), industrials (10.3%), telecom (10.2%), and data centers (10.1%). S&P Global Market Intelligence's 2025 REIT outlook published in October 2024 notes that healthcare and data center REITs are trading at the highest premium to their net asset values, while hotel, timber, farmland, and office REITs trade at the largest discount. The ETF has traded since 2004 and averaged slightly over a 3% dividend.\n\nVanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF -- 3.4% yield\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VSS) also invests internationally, although this one focuses on small-cap stocks abroad. Nearly 31% of the fund targets small caps in Europe, roughly 30% focuses on small caps internationally, and over 15% targets small caps in North America. Like the other two funds, returns have been minimal, which makes sense given the performance of international and small-cap stocks. Here are the top 10 holdings by weighting:\n\nWSP Global -- 0.70% RB Global -- 0.53% Kinross Gold -- 0.36% Emera -- 0.35% ARC Resources -- 0.35% TFI International -- 0.34% Celestica -- 0.34% Descartes Systems Group -- 0.31% AtkinsRealis Group -- 0.30% GFL Environmental -- 0.29%\n\nSmall-cap international stocks can be more volatile but the fund owns 3,300 stocks in more than 46 countries. Also, if there is rotation into emerging markets and some start to see better economic performance, they could start to perform better as well. The dividend can be a bit choppy but also can accelerate higher.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Credit: Trafigura via Flickr\n\nTrafigura Group is seeking permission to subpoena Wall Street banks for information that might help the commodity trading giant track down the more than half a billion dollars it lost in an alleged nickel fraud.\n\nTrafigura is still chasing down the funds almost two years after news broke that it was on the hook for almost $600 million of nickel in containers that turned out to be almost worthless carbon steel. It\u2019s suing Prateek Gupta \u2014 the businessman it paid the money to \u2014 and companies affiliated with his network in London.\n\nThe trading house filed a request in a New York court on Monday to serve a subpoena on 15 financial institutions \u201clikely to have processed any transfers of the US dollar proprietary funds\u201d it has so far been unable to find, despite a freezing order against Gupta.\n\n\u201cDespite a worldwide freezing order and multiple disclosure orders, the English defendants have refused to provide the information Trafigura needs to determine the whereabouts of all the funds it paid,\u201d the New York filing said.\n\nAccording to the filing, Trafigura is seeking information from the US or New York branches of Bank of America Corp., Bank of China, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citibank, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA, Standard Chartered Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co., as well as The Clearing House Payments Company LLC.\n\nIn a London court case, Gupta has denied the charges against him. The businessman has also faced financial difficulties, with TMT Metals Holdings Ltd. \u2013 a British metals trader controlled by Gupta \u2014 wound up by a creditor in 2023.\n\nA Trafigura spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Gupta did not immediately comment. Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of New York Mellon, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, while the rest did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\n(By Archie Hunter and Jonathan Browning)\n\nRead More: How Citigroup helped lift the lid on Trafigura\u2019s nickel nightmare",

Spokespeople for Jefferies and Barclays declined to comment.\n\nJefferies also recently hired Arnaud Collas from Citigroup Inc. to take up a role as managing director in EMEA leveraged finance, the people said. A spokesperson for Citigroup declined to comment, while Kerry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment and Collas couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nAcquisition-related financings have started to tick up after years of muted activity, and banks are getting ready to arrange more deals that offer some of the most lucrative fees in investment banking.\n\nThe buyout of Dutch generic drugmaker Synthon International Holding BV is one example where Jefferies is among lenders lining up about \u20ac900 million ($938 million) of loans. Jefferies is also an adviser to private equity firm EQT AB on the possible sale of Swedish consumer-health business Karo Healthcare.

The bank will wind down its equity capital markets and advisory services in these regions over the coming months, shifting its focus to core operations in Asia and the Middle East, according to an internal memo.This move will affect employees in the affected regions as HSBC plans to complete existing deals before closing these operations.Staff engaged in shutting down the investment banking units will be offered retention bonuses until their roles end. However, many positions are expected to be eliminated or relocated to strengthen the bank\u2019s presence in Asia and the Middle East.The restructuring is part of Mr Elhedery\u2019s broader plan to make HSBC more competitive and cost-efficient. The bank is targeting at least $3 billion in expense reductions, equivalent to roughly 10% of its annual costs. A significant portion of this is expected to come from reducing its $19 billion wage bill.Additionally, employees in corporate and institutional banking have been warned to expect smaller bonuses in 2025, compounding workforce concerns. While some staff may find opportunities in regions where HSBC is bolstering operations, uncertainty looms for others as job cuts remain likely.HSBC\u2019s pivot reflects its struggle to compete with Wall Street giants in the West and highlights a strategic shift toward markets where it holds a stronger competitive edge.

The bank's ranking in M&A advisory work has been declining over the long term. It's a fiercely competitive market, and with deal volumes in Europe having been depressed in recent years, maybe it is no longer worth prioritising this region,\u201d Alex Marshall, Senior Partner at consultancy firm CIL, said.\n\nAccording to LSEG data, HSBC earned the most investment banking fees in MENA during 2024, a total of $107.3 million, or a 7% share of the total fee pool.\n\n\u201cWe have substantial issuances on local currency, especially in the Saudi market.

He has been spearheading a restructuring programme after replacing Noel Quinn as chief executive last year. The restructuring has seen many senior managers losing jobs, while the MENAT region saw a new order of leaders.\n\nRELATED STORY: HSBC shakes up senior leadership team, appoints new Middle East CEO\n\n\u201cI think HSBC's move reflects a realistic and pragmatic doubling-down of their bet on Asia and MENA capital flows. They aren't really abandoning a position of great strength in Europe and the US by contrast to their dominance in other markets,\u201d Marshall said.\n\n(Reporting by Seban Scaria; editing by Daniel Luiz)\n\nseban.scaria@lseg.com",

More importantly, the decision unveiled on Tuesday marked a decision to prioritise Asian corporate clients over companies in the West.\n\nInsiders were stunned at the timing of HSBC's biggest investment banking retrenchment in decades as U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda has fuelled hopes of a dealmaking bonanza this year and beyond.\n\nSome HSBC veterans, however, said the teams of specialist bankers advising big companies in the West on their corporate deals had rarely been profitable on their own, and HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery was boldly culling expensive sacred cows his predecessors had opted to keep.\n\n\"We are one of the last remaining truly global banks standing that provides its clients leading banking products and services which span transactional banking to capital markets,\" Michael Roberts, CEO of HSBC Bank Plc and of Corporate and Institutional Banking, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We are committed to serving our clients globally.\"\n\nElhedery, appointed to the top job last September, is a pragmatist who is going through HSBC's business \"line by line\", cutting back parts that do not pay their way or personnel who do not bring significant client relationships, said a former executive who had oversight of the equity capital markets and M&A business lines.\n\nHSBC's European and U.S. ECM and M&A businesses collectively likely only accounted for 19% of the lender's overall investment banking revenue and just 0.3% of total group revenue, analysts at Citigroup estimated on Tuesday.",

            "content": "HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC-N plans to wind down its M&A and some equities businesses in Europe and the Americas, the bank said on Tuesday, accelerating a shift to Asia in its biggest retrenchment from investment banking in decades.\n\n\u201cOur intention is to move to a more competitive, scalable, financing-led model,\u201d Michael Roberts, chief executive officer of HSBC Bank, said in a memo sent to staff seen by Reuters, which said the lender would retain more focused M&A and equity capital markets capabilities in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.K.-headquartered bank, which employs around 220,000 people globally, confirmed the contents of the memo.\n\nSince the global financial crisis, HSBC has been scaling back its worldwide footprint, starting with exiting dozens of low-returning consumer banking activities, from France to Greece to Canada.\n\nUnder CEO Georges Elhedery, who replaced Noel Quinn in September, HSBC is now overhauling its deal-making and corporate advisory activities in the West in a bid to boost returns and tighten its focus on Asia, where the lender already earns the bulk of its profit.\n\nHSBC ranked 14th globally in investment banking fees in 2024, according to LSEG data, down a notch from the previous year. The bank\u2019s market share in the fees pot reached 1.5 per cent, mostly thanks to the revenues from its debt financing business, the data show.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many roles will be cut as a result of Tuesday\u2019s surprise announcement, nor the likely savings, nor how many bankers might be redeployed to other financing businesses where HSBC considers it is better able to compete with U.S. rivals that have dominated investment banking\u2019s most lucrative segments for years.\n\nAnalysts have been questioning where Mr. Elhedery could achieve savings while the bank remained a global, full-service wholesale lender.\n\nHSBC will keep its debt capital markets and leveraged acquisition finance operations globally, Mr. Roberts told staff in the memo, which acknowledged how \u201cunsettling\u201d the news would be for bankers who advise on deal-making and corporate equity raising, such as through initial public offerings.\n\nNews of the plan on the eve of China\u2019s Lunar New Year has sent shock waves round the lender.\n\nOne senior banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, questioned the rationale of the restructuring, and how the bank would support its debt financing activities without the M&A advisory capabilities.\n\nBut some analysts and former insiders praised HSBC management for bowing out of businesses where it had struggled to thrive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of times HSBC has been in and out of ECM in the U.K. It never seems to succeed,\u201d Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, these are expensive businesses to run and if you are not winning the business and generating the fees then it\u2019s easy to lose money.\u201d\n\nHSBC shares were little changed after the news, down 0.2 per cent to 822 pence at 1146 GMT, valuing the bank at about \u00a3147-billion ($263-billion).\n\nIn recent years, other European banks have made similar attempts to scale back global investment banking activities to focus on core markets where they are stronger; Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank pulled out of equities while Switzerland\u2019s UBS has retrenched from some trading businesses.\n\nSome commentators were surprised by the timing of HSBC\u2019s decision, given capital markets activity is expected to grow in the near term, fuelled by expectations of interest-rate cuts and pro-growth policy-making across the West in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s return to power.\n\n\u201cThe bank is being run with medium- to long-term view,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Toms told Reuters.\n\n\u201cGeographically, the move reflects the continued shift from West to East, where growth and profitability are higher.\u201d\n\nHSBC\u2019s decision to shutter the businesses was earlier reported by Bloomberg.",

            "content": "Deregulation is expected to spur banking deals in 2025 after topping highs of $41.5 billion in 2024. \u201cWe would expect 2025 to be another strong year for M&A as management teams have surplus cash burning a hole in their pockets and buybacks are becoming less accretive,\u201d said Nick Brand, a fund manager at Polar Capital Global Financial Trust.\n\nLikewise, President Donald Trump's winning the hotly contested election is emerging as another factor that could continue pushing European bank stocks higher in 2025. That\u2019s in part because the new administration has affirmed its commitment to deregulation tax cuts and fiscal stimulus expected to fuel deals and activities in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe expect the unwind of public stakes at some European listed banks to continue at an uneven pace this year,\u201d said Roberto Scholes, head of strategy at wealth manager Singular Bank. The moves would \" positively impact share prices as potential public interference dissipates.\u201d\n\nThe Stoxx 600 Europe Banks Index is predicted to see average price returns of over 8% in 2025, continuing the upward trend. Analysts claim that more value may be unlocked and that European banking stocks are still inexpensive when compared to their US counterparts. A favourable outlook for banking stocks is making now a good time for European governments and buyout companies to sell their holdings.\n\nInterest rate cuts as the year came to a close did little to dent investor sentiments on the European bank's outlook, as depicted by the Euro Stoxx Bank index rising to its highest level since 2010. While loan growth slowed due to the high interest rate environment, effective risk management did more than enough to offset the losses.\n\nDue to their emphasis on fee-based income and wealth management services, major European banks have managed to stay profitable. Additionally, Eurozone banks came into 2024 with stronger balance sheets, lower non-performing loan ratios, and larger capital buffers thanks to strict regulatory reforms put in place following the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nStrong earnings, record shareholder returns and resilience amid falling interest rates were the catalysts behind European bank stocks delivering their best year in over a decade. On average, the stocks were up by more than 32% as they benefited from a high interest rate environment as the European central bank sought to keep inflation in check in 2024.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best European Bank Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against the other European bank stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, investors have been drawn to Europe's beat-down valuations across industries, with stock prices in the region trading at a record 40% discount to their US counterparts based on forward earnings multiples. There are indications that European M&A may continue to pick up in 2025 as buyout companies seek to deploy record quantities of unspent capital.\n\nWhile there have been fears that banks would come under pressure as central banks in the region cut the benchmark interest rates, the sector appears to be more than prepared. A lower interest rate environment is expected to fuel deal-making expected to maintain the positive earnings momentum. Similarly, European bank balance sheets are more than equipped for the test. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the sector median CET1 ratio, which measures capital levels, is at the highest level it has ever been since 2011, at 14.9%.\n\n\u201cNow that balance sheets are stronger and the product factories have been strengthened, European banks are now reconsidering larger deals,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note. \u201cThis renewed focus is positive for banks with discounted valuations that could become targets.\u201d Stronger balance sheets and improved capital buffers are some of the factors that should allow the best European bank stocks to continue outperforming amid falling interest rates in 2025.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best European bank stocks to buy according to analysts, we first made a list of all European banks and asset managers that trade on the NASDAQ and NYSE stock exchanges using stock screeners. We examined the banks, focusing on why they stand out as long-term investment plays. Finally, they were ranked based on Wall Street analysts' upside potential.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA financial specialist advising a corporate client at the trading desk of a high-stakes bank.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 14\n\nStock Upside Potential as of January 24: 1.15%\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) provides banking and financial services through Wealth and Personal Banking, Commercial Banking, and Global Banking and Markets segments. It stands out as one of the best European banks to buy owing to its track record in returning value through buybacks and dividends. The bank has returned over $34 billion to shareholders over the past two years.\n\nAfter announcing a 9.9% surge in third-quarter profit to $8.48 billion, HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) confirmed a $3 billion share repurchase program. The buyback program aligns with the bank's long-term plan to deliver enhanced shareholder value while maintaining a solid capital structure. The $3 billion buyback program comes from the bank, delivering solid financial results characterized by revenue growth and solid performance in the wealth and wholesale transaction units.\n\nIn 2025, HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) also intends to simplify its geographic governance and restructure its organization into four business lines. Additionally, the business has reaffirmed its goal of a return on tangible equity in the mid-teens. These latest events demonstrate HSBC's dedication to expansion and reorganization.\n\nAs of January 24th, HSBC had an upside potential of 1.15%. Despite the modest average upside, the highest target suggests significant growth. The stock is rated as a Strong Buy by several analysts. Over the past year, 5 Wall Street analysts have rated HSBC, resulting in a consensus \"Buy\" rating: 1 hold, 3 buys, and 1 strong buy.\n\nOverall HSBC ranks 10th among the best European bank stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of HSBC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than HSBC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The best dividend stocks to buy now are companies that provide significant paydays and stability. After all, a 5% dividend is cold comfort if the share price of your investment drops 50%.\n\n\n\nThat means investors should place a priority on dividend investments that have staying power as well as income potential. While there's no such thing as a sure thing, it is possible to sidestep risk and volatility by focusing on stocks with consistent profits, a strong track record of dividend growth as they share those profits with investors, and a sustainable payout ratio where these dividend stocks have the fundamentals to support payouts even if the economy gets choppy.\n\nThe following list of the 15 best dividend stocks spans stocks in a variety of sectors. However, each of these names stands good chance of hanging tough no matter what happens in 2025:\n\nDividend Stock Sector Market Value Forward Dividend Yield* AbbVie Inc. (ticker: ABBV) Health care $364 billion 3.2% Altria Group Inc. (MO) Consumer staples $93 billion 7.4% Amcor PLC (AMCR) Consumer cyclical $15 billion 5.1% American Tower Corp. (AMT) Real estate $95 billion 3.2% AT&T Inc. (T) Communication services $193 billion 4.2% BHP Group Ltd. (BHP) Materials $127 billion 4.9% CME Group Inc. (CME) Financial $90 billion 4.4% Dominion Energy Inc. (D) Utilities $48 billion 4.7% Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD) Energy $72 billion 6.5% Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) Financials $29 billion 3.5% Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Health care $392 billion 3.0% Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) Consumer staples $46.7 billion 3.6% Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Health care $115 billion 6.5% Prologis Inc. (PLD) Real estate $112 billion 3.3% United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Industrial $101 billion 5.6%\n\n*As of Feb. 26 close.\n\nAbbVie Inc. (ABBV)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $364 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.2%\n\nAbbVie is currently among the top pharmaceutical companies in the world based on sales, with projections of almost $60 billion in revenue expected for fiscal 2025 \u2013 which will grow to almost $64 billion in fiscal year 2026 if projections hold. It continues to thrive thanks to an impressive product pipeline that includes blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which treat things such as Crohn's disease and arthritis. That strong mix of drugs and consistent revenue has led to great long-term dividend growth, with payouts currently at $1.64 annually, up more than three-fold from just 51 cents quarterly back in 2015.\n\nAltria Group Inc. (MO)\n\nSector: Consumer staples\n\nMarket value: $93 billion\n\nDividend yield: 7.4%\n\nTobacco giant Altria is the obvious place to begin for almost any kind of dividend investor. MO has incredibly reliable revenue from an entrenched (and addictive) product portfolio that includes Marlboro cigarettes, Black & Mild pipe and cigar products, and smokeless tobacco like Copenhagen and Skoal. The steady profits and sales fuel steady dividend growth, with Altria boasting 55 consecutive annual dividend increases after its last boost to $1.02 per quarter as of August. What's more, MO stock has done more than just deliver dividends, as shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index in the past 12 months, with 34% gains versus 17% for the broader market.\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nAmcor PLC (AMCR)\n\nSector: Consumer cyclical\n\nMarket value: $15 billion\n\nDividend yield: 5.1%\n\nBased in Switzerland, Amcor is a leader in packaging that sees strong and reliable demand for its products. While technically in the discretionary sector, its purchasers are staples producers like beverages and processed foods companies and pharmaceutical firms. Making blister packs of pills and cardboard milk cartons isn't particularly glamorous, but it's a crucial part of the global economy and one that has proven to be quite durable regardless of short-term disruptions. And with dividends adding up to roughly two-thirds or so of earnings, income investors can be sure their quarterly checks from this cheap dividend stock should keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmerican Tower Corp. (AMT)\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nMarket value: $95 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.2%\n\nAmerican Tower is a specialist in multi-tenant communications real estate, which includes telecom towers, fiber optic networks, data centers and other important infrastructure components that power our digital lives. With a portfolio of 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of U.S. data center facilities, AMT operates an incredibly reliable business thanks to both its reach and the ever-increasing demand for data. The company's generous $1.62 quarterly dividend is up roughly three-fold from just 42 cents per quarter to start 2015, proving its long-term commitment to dividend growth. And since AMT is structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and must deliver 90% of taxable income back to shareholders, it has a clear mandate to continue its practice of generous dividends in the years ahead.\n\nSector: Communication services\n\nMarket value: $193 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.2%\n\nAT&T has roots tracing back to 1885 and is among the dominant telecoms on the planet. It is certainly not resting on its laurels, however, after embarking on a restructuring plan in 2022 to streamline operations and reduce its long-term debt and maintain its customer base of 120 million accounts. The moves seem to be winning over Wall Street lately, however, with shares up more than 80% from their 2023 lows and up almost 20% since Jan. 1. The prospect of rate cuts coupled with lower debt and almost $40 billion operating cash flow has given many investors confidence that this company has what it takes to continue paying big-time dividends for quite some time.\n\nBHP Group Ltd. (BHP)\n\nSector: Materials\n\nMarket value: $127 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.9%\n\nMaterials stocks can be risky in part because they are tied to commodity prices and cyclical industrial demand more than any unique product or operational edge. That said, in an inflationary environment the materials that miners like BHP take out of the ground are worth more than ever \u2013 which makes now the perfect time to consider a dividend stock like this one. BHP is among the biggest natural resources companies on the planet, operating in Australia, Asia, Europe, North America and South America and produces materials including copper, iron ore, coal, silver, gold, uranium and nickel. Though BHP only pays dividends twice a year, it delivers a yield more than three times that of the S&P 500 at present.\n\nCME Group Inc. (CME)\n\nSector: Financial\n\nMarket value: $90 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.4%\n\nFounded in 1898, CME is one of the world's largest exchanges for futures and options contracts. These derivatives are generally in demand for risk management, but they become even more popular on Wall Street during times of change and uncertainty \u2013 two things that seem to be the order of the day in 2025. In particular, S&P 500 futures used to hedge against market volatility are booming, as are futures tied to Treasury markets and crude oil. As volumes remain strong, CME has seen shares rise about 20% in the past six months even as the S&P has only tacked on about 5% or so in the same period. And long-term, the dominant nature of this derivatives exchange means it will be able to support its generous dividend going forward.\n\nDominion Energy Inc. (D)\n\nSector: Utilities\n\nMarket value: $48 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.7%\n\nUtilities are among the best dividend stocks to buy thanks to consistent sales that fuel reliable dividends. Dominion is a leading utility in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., operating in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina to serve about 2.8 million customers across its network of 80,000 miles of electricity lines and nearly 100,000 miles of gas pipelines. With a wide moat thanks to the high costs of entry and highly regulated nature of the business, Dominion is as stable a business as you will find on Wall Street.\n\nEnterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)\n\nSector: Energy\n\nMarket value: $72 billion\n\nDividend yield: 6.5%\n\nEnergy stocks can be risky if they are overly dependent on favorable pricing in the oil and gas market. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the best dividend stocks to buy because it is largely independent from commodity prices thanks to a model as a transportation and storage specialist. As a \"midstream\" energy company, EPD simply charges other energy firms for use of its pipelines to transport crude oil, petrochemicals and natural gas \u2013 regardless of whether the market prices are good or bad for those fossil fuels. As a result, the stock just logged its 27th year of consecutive dividend increases in January, proving a long-term commitment to driving shareholder value through generous and regular paydays.\n\nFifth Third Bancorp (FITB)\n\nSector: Financials\n\nMarket value: $29 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.5%\n\n\n\nIt's tempting to gravitate toward megabanks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) as icons of stability in the financial sector. And while that's normally the case, it's worth noting that talk of cross-border disruptions post serious risks to interconnected global institutions \u2013 while the U.S. regional banking sector, on the other hand, remains insulated from the fallout of a global trade war. Fifth Third is among the largest regional banks, making it the perfect \"goldilocks\" dividend stock in the financial sector because it is neither too small to be risky nor too large to be exposed to geopolitical fallout. Shares are up about 30% in the past 12 months to handily outperform the S&P 500 in the same period, with FITB delivering a juicy dividend on top of that.\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $392 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.0%\n\nJ&J is one of just two companies with the tip-top \"AAA\" rating for its credit \u2013 tech giant Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is the other \u2013 and boasts an amazing 62 consecutive years of dividend growth to make it one of the most bulletproof dividend stocks out there. It is also one of the 25 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization, regardless of sector. That's thanks to a long history of innovation and drug research, which has given birth to its current blockbusters that include bone cancer treatment Darzalex and anti-inflammatory drug Stelara. The general low-risk nature of drug sales plus the specific scale and strength of this market leader make it among the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nSector: Consumer staples\n\nMarket value: $46.7 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.6%\n\nKimberly-Clark is the paper products powerhouse behind Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kleenex, Cottonelle and other ubiquitous household brands. These products are mainstays of any budget in both good times and bad, meaning KMB is a blue-chip stock that has staying power regardless of the macroeconomic environment. From an income perspective, Kimberly-Clark is equally sturdy, with a 53-year history of consecutive annual dividend growth after the declaration of its March dividend of $1.26 per share. There may not be breakneck growth or innovation ahead for its products, but it remains one of the best dividend stocks to buy for investors who want a low-volatility and low-risk company.\n\nPfizer Inc. (PFE)\n\nSector: Health care\n\nMarket value: $115 billion\n\nDividend yield: 6.5%\n\nA Wall Street darling and top performer just a few years ago, more recently Pfizer has struggled thanks to stumbles with both its vaccine business as well as its attempt to compete in the increasingly lucrative obesity drug market. Shares have been roughly cut in half from their late 2022 peak as a result. This Big Pharma mainstay may have fallen on hard times, but it's also worth noting that this firm has deep roots tracing back to 1849 \u2013 and in the here and now, it remains comfortably profitable, with dividends only about 60% of total profits. As one of the most respected brands in health care, PFE likely isn't going anywhere \u2013 so if you don't mind the recent volatility, this could be a big-time dividend bargain to consider.\n\nPrologis Inc. (PLD)\n\nSector: Real estate\n\nMarket value: $112 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.3%\n\nPrologis is the largest stock in the U.S. real estate sector, but isn't a traditional housing or office space play. Instead, this firm specializes in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. PLD is a key part of the global supply chain with warehouses, with 1.2 billion square feet of space across 19 different countries and top clients including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and FedEx Corp. (FDX). These top-tier clients make it highly likely PLD will thrive for years to come, and its structure as a REIT demands that Prologis delivers 90% of its taxable income back to shareholders. That creates a mandate for generous and consistent dividends that have grown from 40 cents quarterly in 2015 to $1.01 right now.\n\nUnited Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)\n\nSector: Industrial\n\nMarket value: $101 billion\n\nDividend yield: 5.6%",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s quarterly inflation data this week may be key to whether the Reserve Bank finally embarks on a monetary easing cycle soon, and in turn, help decide the timing of an election due by May 17.\n\nWhile money markets are pricing about an 80% chance the RBA will cut the cash rate at its Feb. 17-18 meeting, much depends on price data scheduled for release on Wednesday. Economists expect the trimmed mean inflation \u2014 the more closely-watched gauge less affected by the impact of recent government rebates \u2014 to have eased to 3.3%, a three-year low.\n\nFor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, cooling inflation would be a fillip for his Labor government which is running neck-and-neck in polls with the opposition ahead of the election. With Australians increasingly frustrated by housing and cost-of-living pressures, an RBA decision to lower borrowing costs from a 13-year high would be a tailwind for Albanese heading into the campaign.\n\nSlowing price gains would also vindicate the government\u2019s decision to provide energy and rental subsidies to ease the burden on households.\n\nIn Canberra, there\u2019s growing consensus that the government will hold the election after the RBA\u2019s April 1 decision in the hope of securing at least one rate cut before the ballot. The RBA has held the key rate at 4.35% for the past 14 months and is the only major central bank yet to cut, excluding the Bank of Japan that\u2019s in a tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cIf core inflation is at or below expectations, the political narrative will clearly be the government saying \u2014 \u2018we have done a great job on this, we don\u2019t need contractionary monetary policy anymore\u2019,\u201d according to Robert Brooks from the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University who expects Albanese to wait for the RBA\u2019s February decision before calling the election.\n\nAlbanese himself hasn\u2019t given anything away on the election timing although he has been actively campaigning. The prime minister\u2019s disapproval rating of 57% is higher than opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s 51% in Newspoll\u2019s latest survey.\n\nRead: Australia PM Makes Pitch for Second Term in Power as Polls Waver\n\nThe key inflation measure easing in line with expectations would also beat the RBA\u2019s 3.4% estimate. Some economists believe that could pave the way for a February rate cut. Still, others are skeptical. HSBC Holdings Plc. said in a note on Monday that employment data are also important, citing the strong jobs report in December.\n\nHeadline inflation, which has been partly restrained by state and federal government rebates, probably cooled last quarter to 2.5%, the midpoint of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target.\n\nAn analysis by Westpac Banking Corp. suggests that rebates shaved 0.4 percentage point off the headline print in the third quarter and a further 0.3 in October-December. Average inflation in 2024 would have been 3.2% rather than the estimated 2.5% without the rebates.\n\n\u201cAny headline inflation with a two in front of it shows that inflation has more than halved since we came to government,\u201d Treasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement ahead of the data, adding that it would also be within the RBA\u2019s target band.\n\nData on Tuesday showed Australia\u2019s business conditions rebounded to near their long-run average, driven by the retail sector as consumer spending picked up. The report also showed that capacity utilization rose to 82.8% in December, suggesting economy-wide demand still exceeds supply.\n\nThat is partly due to elevated government spending \u2014 both federal and state. Robust demand is also keeping services inflation sticky and the labor market strong, with unemployment hovering around 4%.\n\nSome economists worry that both sides of politics will unleash major spending initiatives during the election campaign given the tightness of the race.\n\nMeanwhile, currency weakness could fuel imported inflation.\n\nThe Australian dollar fell more than 10% in the final three months of last year, a period that included the Nov. 5 election victory of Donald Trump that sent the greenback soaring. The Aussie has since recovered some ground, though like other currencies, it remains heavily influenced by US tariff signals.\n\nRead: Dollar Starts Week on Front Foot on Trump\u2019s Colombia Tariffs\n\nUBS Group AG, Citigroup Inc. and Westpac reckon policymakers will wait a few more months before easing. Even those predicting a cut next month have their doubts.\n\n\u201cA hold in February is not off the table if the RBA puts more weight on its concerns that the persistent tightness in the labor market and expected recovery in household spending growth still pose upside risks to inflation,\u201d said Catherine Birch, a senior economist at ANZ Bank.\n\nAnd even when the RBA does start to cut, most economists, including Birch, expect the cycle will be fairly short and shallow.\n\n\u201cThe RBA will take a cautious approach in dialing down the restrictiveness of current policy settings,\u201d she said.\n\n--With assistance from Ben Westcott.\n\n(Adds business confidence survey in 12th paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Close to 40 per cent of the HK$34 billion in Hong Kong commercial real estate transactions in 2024 were distressed sales or capital loss deals. PHOTO: ST FILE\n\n\u2013 Distressed property sales in Hong Kong are beginning to bite banks that used to be well protected against loan losses.\n\nThe city\u2019s commercial real estate sector is going through one of its worst slumps in history, with no end in sight. Average prices of office buildings, shopping malls and other properties have fallen more than 40 per cent from their highs in 2018, eroding the value of the collateral backing many bank loans. Defaults are also rising as more property owners and developers run into cash flow difficulties.\n\nClose to 40 per cent of the HK$34 billion in Hong Kong commercial real estate transactions in 2024 were distressed sales or capital loss deals, where owners \u2013 including banks \u2013 sold properties for less than what they originally paid, according to data from Colliers International.\n\nIn 2023, such deals for offices, retail spaces, hotels, serviced apartments and industrial assets, made up 21 per cent of the total transaction volume. The data covers deals of least HK$100 million.\n\n\u201cBanks are realising that if they don\u2019t sell their commercial properties, the values will go lower and lower,\u201d said Mr James Mak, chief sales director at Midland Commercial Realty, a property brokerage. \u201cThey have to sell at a loss because that\u2019s how the market is now.\u201d\n\nMost Hong Kong lenders have sizeable exposures to the city\u2019s real estate industry, but the deepening slump is unlikely to cause systemic issues for the banking sector, which is well capitalised.\n\nStill, pressure on their commercial real estate portfolios is increasing, and investors are becoming more concerned about rising bad loans, said Ms Karen Wu, a credit analyst at research firm CreditSights.\n\nThe recent debt turmoil at builder New World Development, which is trying to extend some of its loans, have also put the issue in focus.\n\nSome of the city\u2019s banks had been recovering from the hit they took from the downturn in mainland China\u2019s real estate market.\n\n\u201cNow, there are potentially bigger problems arising from Hong Kong\u2019s commercial property sector,\u201d Ms Wu said. So far, the troubles have mostly been at mid-sized and smaller developers, she added.\n\nRising office vacancies and softening rents in Hong Kong are threatening the quality of US$80 billion (S$107.7 billion) of commercial real estate loans at five major banks in the city, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence in late November.\n\nThe lenders, which include Hang Seng Bank, its parent HSBC Holdings, Bank of East Asia, Bank of China\u2019s Hong Kong unit and Standard Chartered, have made about 40 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s total property development and investment loans.\n\nThe vast majority of the commercial real estate debt is performing, but the risks are elevated, analysts Francis Chan and Patrick Wong said in the report.\n\n\u201cDeclining collateral values might pressure the banks to take charges on more loans in 2025,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHang Seng Bank last summer reported a sharp increase in credit-impaired Hong Kong commercial real estate loans to HK$13.5 billion as at June 2024, from HK$1.1 billion at the end of 2023. That caused its non-performing loan ratio for the portfolio to jump to 9.6 per cent from 0.8 per cent.\n\nSome banks have taken over assets from troubled borrowers. A company owned by Chiyu Banking Corp., a Hong Kong lender, earlier in January took over a commercial building in the city\u2019s Sheung Wan district at a market valuation of HK$1.298 billion, according to a land registry record and a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe building had a mortgage from Chiyu Bank of more than HK$1.5 billion, said the person.\n\nThe November sale of Cheung Kei Centre caused seven lenders, including two Chinese banks and Hang Seng Bank, to realise a total of HK$2 billion in losses on a HK$4.6 billion mortgage they made in 2019, according to land records.\n\nMore on this Topic Chinese students come to the rescue of Hong Kong\u2019s struggling commercial property market\n\nLenders earlier seized the waterfront building from Chinese businessman Chen Hongtian after his Hong Kong company ran into liquidity problems.\n\nThe 17-storey tower, which has offices and retail space, was originally acquired by Mr Chen\u2019s Cheung Kei Group in 2016 for HK$4.5 billion, or 42 per cent more than the price it was recently sold for.\n\nIn late 2023, the 14th floor of Capital Centre, a grade A office building in Hong Kong Island\u2019s Wanchai district, was sold for HK$145.9 million, according to land records.\n\nThe office premises had been pledged to a HK$198 million loan taken out by Skyfame Realty, a Chinese real estate developer that has since defaulted on the debt, according to Skyfame\u2019s last interim report.\n\nThe sale meant that Bank of East Asia, which made the loan, incurred a loss. A bank spokesperson said the transaction\u2019s financial impact was reflected in its 2023 accounts.\n\n\u2018Manageable Losses\u2019\n\nHong Kong\u2019s banks have long taken a conservative approach towards property loans. Fitch Ratings estimated in 2024 that the average loan-to-value ratio was less than 50 per cent for all commercial property-backed loans among banks it rated.\n\nThat means there are assets worth at least US$200 million backing every US$100 million in debt.\n\nGoldman Sachs credit analysts said Hong Kong\u2019s banks have strong balance sheets and capital buffers that will help them withstand the downturn. They said in a mid-December report that even if commercial real estate prices decline another 35 per cent, losses would still be manageable for banks.\n\n\u201cWe believe worries about the Hong Kong banking sector are overblown,\u201d they said.\n\nThe continuing asset value declines mean some commercial real estate transactions could see discounts of as much as 60 per cent from the original purchase price, said Mr Thomas Chak, head of capital markets and investment services at Colliers.\n\nMr Raymond Kwong, an associate director at PwC Hong Kong\u2019s restructuring and insolvency practice, said: \u201cA lot of those loans were borrowed three to five years ago, when the valuation was at the peak.\u201d\n\nSome lenders with bad loans have to decide whether to offload assets and realise potential losses, or wait for an indeterminate period for property values to recover, he said.

            "content": "In today\u2019s topsy-turvy credit world, risky bonds are outperforming safe ones in periods of volatility. The reason? An increasing focus on interest income, or carry in industry parlance.\n\nStrong inflows into credit funds have compressed spreads \u2013 the premium for buying corporate debt rather than safer government bonds \u2013 so much that further tightening looks unlikely. That\u2019s left money managers seeking other ways to beat their benchmarks. Low-rated and junior bonds are increasingly attractive to them because the higher coupons they typically pay help offset falling values when yields move up.\n\nThe trend is so powerful that high-yield securities dropped less than their blue-chip counterparts during the worst of the bond sell-off earlier this month, even though the companies that issue them are more likely to go bust. A similar story is playing out with subordinated securities, which have performed strongly under a measure that compares investment returns with risk known as the Sharpe ratio.\n\n\u201cThis is reinforcing the view that carry is the flavour of this year. The lowest-risk assets\u201d \u2013 sovereign bonds \u2013 \u201chave been the most volatile and you have recently got the best Sharpe ratios in things like CoCos,\u201d said Ninety One portfolio manager Darpan Harar. CoCos, an abbreviation of contingent convertibles, are a type of subordinated note issued by banks.\n\nRisky bonds are usually what investors call high-beta instruments: they gain more when times are good but lose more in bear markets. What\u2019s different this time is that fiscal deficit concerns are making government bonds less attractive, while differing interest rate cut paths make riding an expected decline in yields as policy rates fall an uncertain strategy.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to realise that credit spreads are not the volatile part now, the volatile part is the risk-free rate. It\u2019s completely turned upside down,\u201d said Flavio Fabbrizi, head of corporate debt capital markets for Europe at HSBC Holdings.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nAnother factor is that high-yield bonds are typically shorter duration than high-grade notes, making prices less sensitive to yield changes. A Bloomberg-compiled global junk bond gauge has almost half the duration of its investment-grade counterpart, meaning that a one-percentage-point increase in yields will trigger double the price drop in safer bonds.\n\nEven though junk bonds were caught in the recent sell-off, triggered by concerns that the US Federal Reserve especially would have little reason to cut interest rates, the biggest year-to-date loss for the sector through Thursday (Jan 23) was 0.57 per cent, Bloomberg-compiled data shows. For high-grade bonds, it was about three times that and \u2013 unlike junk bonds\u2019 strong rebound \u2013 they have barely managed to break even for the year.\n\nSimilarly, senior bonds issued mostly by European banks generally lagged Additional Tier 1 bonds, the riskiest type of bank debt, and remain in the red.\n\nStill, questions about refinancing costs are also bound to emerge as many notes that are coming due feature relatively low risk premiums.\n\n\u201cYou do have to be careful to avoid those bonds which may have refinancing issues because the spreads are not very high,\u201d said Per Wehrmann, a high-yield portfolio manager at DWS Group. \u201cOtherwise it can become like picking pennies up in front of a speeding train.\u201d\n\nAssuming the borrower doesn\u2019t default, investors can expect to earn at least the coupon payment, making it particularly important when yield or spread movements are loss-making.\n\n\u201cYour first line of defence as credit manager is carry,\u201d Harar at Ninety One said.

            "content": "Emerging-market (EM) currencies climbed during the first week of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, helped by a softer-than-expected rollout of US tariffs and the absence of new levies on Chinese imports.\n\nThe benchmark index for developing-nation currencies rose 1.2 per cent last week, the best weekly showing since July 2023. Trump\u2019s comments hinting that he would rather not impose levies on China helped lift Asian currencies on Friday (Jan 24).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a relief rally,\u201d said Alvin Tan, head of Asian FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Singapore. \u201cThe market is relieved that the worst-case scenario\u201d regarding US tariffs \u201cappears to be falling by the wayside\u201d.\n\nEmerging currencies are rebounding after their worst quarterly drop since September 2022 as traders priced in expectations of a widespread trade war and a more hawkish Federal Reserve stance amid inflationary pressure in the US. Currencies in emerging Europe and high-yielding Latin American names paced the gains, with the Hungarian forint, the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso advancing more than 2.5 per cent last week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s renewed demand for carry as tariff fears ease and volatility wanes,\u201d said Bernd Berg, a London-based strategist at In Touch Capital. \u201cHigh-yielding Latin American names are profiting the most after selling off last year.\u201d\n\nEmerging-market stocks also benefited from the easing fears. An MSCI index ended the day 0.8 per cent higher on Friday, extending weekly gains to 1.9 per cent.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nInvestors had been on tenterhooks for the first executive orders from the White House after Trump vowed to quickly implement his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy agenda. But in his initial batch of economic announcements, China was omitted from tariff plans which only targeted Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent levies from Feb 1.\n\nThe combination of a bearish positioning going into a second Trump administration and the softer-than-feared stance on tariffs has been enough to bolster assets, and JPMorgan Chase sees room for additional relief for currencies such as the forint and South Africa\u2019s rand.\n\n\u201cInitial indications of a more targeted approach to tariffs help contain left-tail risks,\u201d the bank\u2019s strategists including Saad Siddiqui and Tania Escobedo Jacob wrote in a note on Thursday. \u201cEMFX should well trade with a \u2018no news is good news\u2019 bias.\u201d\n\nThe Malaysian ringgit climbed more than 1 per cent on Friday to the highest since November, the biggest gainer in Asia.\n\nStill, investors remain wary as the uncertainty over US policies remains high. While JPMorgan\u2019s gauge of emerging-market currency volatility has eased, it remains at its highest since August.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump used a speech at Davos to threaten more widespread tariffs on goods not manufactured in the US. A survey by HSBC Holdings showed that 58 per cent of fund managers helping oversee US$343 billion in developing-nation assets were bearish on EM currencies in December, up from 10 per cent in September. And the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows hedge funds are most bearish on Mexican peso since April 2023.\n\n\u201cEM FX has been given a reprieve for now,\u201d said Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Singapore. \u201cHowever, the threat of a resumption of trade wars will limit too much appreciation for EM currencies.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

            "content": "If you're looking for the best stocks to buy for the dividends, it may be time to look outside the U.S.\n\nRight now, the average yield across the S&P 500 is just 1.4%, with leading megabank JPMorgan Chase & Co. (ticker: JPM) yielding only slightly more, at 2% at present. There are some smaller financial firms that provide better income potential, but they can carry elevated risks through investments in distressed companies or \"leveraged\" operations where companies take on big debts with plans of investing that borrowed cash.\n\nThe following stocks are truly bank stocks, with a core customer base of consumers and businesses rather than a reliance on sophisticated investment arms. They are all big in scale, with more than $50 billion in market value, but also reliable dividend providers with payouts of 3% or more \u2013 more than double what you'll get from the typical S&P stock right now:\n\n\n\nBank Stock Market Value Forward Dividend Yield* Banco Santander SA (SAN) $77 billion 4.5% Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) $60 billion 4.1% HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) $184 billion 3.9% Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (MFG) $64 billion 2.9% PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) $78 billion 3.2% Truist Financial Corp. (TFC) $62 billion 4.6% U.S. Bancorp (USB) $76 billion 3.9%\n\n*As of Jan. 22 close.\n\nBanco Santander SA (SAN)\n\nMarket value: $77 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.5%\n\nMadrid-based Santander provides various financial services worldwide, ranging from retail banking to wealth management and corporate financial services. Founded in 1856, it is the pre-eminent bank in Spain and remains a go-to financial provider across the Spanish-speaking world with more than 3,000 branches across South America. As with other international stocks on this list, you'll find the dividend payments don't come on the regular cycle of U.S. blue-chip stocks. SAN pays out twice annually in April and October, but based on those generous distributions it yields roughly three times the dividend payout of the typical S&P 500 stock at present.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)\n\nMarket value: $60 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.1%\n\nAs you can probably guess, CIBC is a financial institution that mainly provides products and services to clients in Canada. Founded in 1867 and headquartered in Toronto, this company is closely tied into the economic fabric of our neighbors to the north. That said, it does do business in several key U.S. markets as well as overseas, with some 11 million customer accounts and more than $380 billion in assets under management. CIBC hasn't missed a regular dividend since its first dividend payment almost 150 years ago, and recently increased payouts to 97 cents per share \u2013 up from 90 cents previously, and 53 cents per share at the beginning of 2015.\n\n\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nHSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC)\n\nMarket value: $184 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.9%\n\nHSBC is a London institution that is a bit smaller than domestic megabanks but would rank as slightly larger than Citigroup Inc. (C) and slightly larger than Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) if it were headquartered here in the U.S. It operates a diversified business, including personal and commercial banking, wealth management and capital markets segments. With about $3 trillion in total assets and operations in more than 60 countries, HSBC ranks as the largest financial institution in Europe. HBC stock is up about 35% over the past 12 months with a generous dividend on top of that. If you are looking for a financial institution with scale but perhaps want to look beyond the U.S. for a leading financial stock, HSBC is worth a look.\n\nMizuho Financial Group Inc. (MFG)\n\nMarket value: $64 billion\n\nDividend yield: 2.9%\n\nJapan's economy has long had a reputation for stagnation, but economists are expecting comparatively brisk growth above 1% in 2025 as the nation continues to looks past previous years of sluggish growth and inflationary pressures. That bodes very well for Mizuho, one of the nation's leading financial institutions. Japan has long been a linchpin of global commerce between the East and West, and while talk of trade wars between the U.S. and China do pose a risk, the local relationships in the region are still meaningful drivers of growth for MFG stock. The bank pays dividends twice annually, in August and in March, so now is a decent time to consider getting in line for that payout in a few months. What's more, shares are up more than 45% in the past 12 months on hopes of an improving regional outlook in the new year.\n\nPNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC)\n\nMarket value: $78 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.2%\n\nThe largest U.S. regional bank by market value, PNC currently has more than $550 billion in total assets. That makes it halfway between a local finance firm and one of the leading and entrenched U.S. megabanks like JPMorgan. This gives it the best of both worlds. On one hand, it is not quite as connected to multinational trends as its larger peers and can sidestep some potential risks from any global trade war. On the other, it has massive scale and resources that make it a go-to provider for essential services like mortgages and small businesses loans. The result is a regional bank that punches above its weight and stands out as one of the best bank stocks to buy for the dividends.\n\nTruist Financial Corp. (TFC)\n\nMarket value: $62 billion\n\nDividend yield: 4.6%\n\nThe regional bank formerly known as BB&T Corporation, Truist had previously been under pressure along with other regional banks in the wake of the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. However, the company has moved past threats of \"contagion\" and credit downgrades and has recently bounced back to levels not seen since before SVB went under. The stock is up about 40% from its 52-week lows, but more importantly still delivered a generous 52-cent dividend each quarter that is roughly half of its earnings. That means payouts are sustainable and perhaps even ripe for future increases in the year ahead.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (USB)\n\nMarket value: $76 billion\n\nDividend yield: 3.9%",

            "content": "Amidst the technological revolution, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in stock market analysis presents a new lens for understanding the dynamics of HSBC\u2019s 0005 HK stock price. As one of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions, HSBC Holdings, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as 0005 HK, is exploiting AI advancements to refine fiscal forecasts and investment strategies.\n\nTraditionally, stock evaluation relied heavily on historical data and financial metrics. However, the incorporation of AI introduces a more nuanced approach by using machine learning algorithms to analyze complex datasets, identify market trends, and predict potential price movements. This shift not only enhances accuracy but also provides a competitive edge for investors, enabling them to make informed decisions in real-time.\n\nFurthermore, the continuous evolution of AI-driven trading platforms could fundamentally reshape the future trading landscape. By leveraging predictive analytics and adaptive algorithms, these platforms offer the potential to mitigate risks associated with volatile markets, creating a stable investment environment.\n\nMoreover, AI\u2019s role in personalized financial advising offers bespoke investment solutions, tailored to individual preferences and risk profiles. As a result, investors can gain a deeper understanding of the potential pathways for the HSBC 0005 HK stock.\n\nAs AI technology evolves, so does its impact on the financial ecosystem. For HSBC 0005 HK, the symbiotic relationship with AI heralds a new era of strategic insight, poised to redefine the parameters of stock prediction and financial growth.\n\nThe Evolution of AI in Stock Market Analysis and Its Implications for the Future\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the realm of stock market analysis is not just transforming how financial data is interpreted but is also reshaping broader aspects of the environment, humanity, the economy, and the future of trading. By delving into the example of HSBC Holdings\u2019 stock (0005 HK) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, we can gain insights into the ripple effects of AI\u2019s influence on these facets.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nWhile AI\u2019s role in stock analysis isn\u2019t directly related to environmental changes, its indirect implications are noteworthy. AI-enhanced trading can lead to more efficient market transactions, which in turn optimizes resource allocation globally. This efficiency can ripple into more sustainable business practices as capital flows more effectively into environmentally friendly technologies and companies, potentially accelerating the green economy.\n\nHuman Impact\n\nThe advent of AI in stock market analysis enhances decision-making through unprecedented precision. While this innovation provides individuals and institutional investors with powerful tools, it also requires a reevaluation of human roles in financial services. There\u2019s a significant shift toward AI-driven advisory, potentially marginalizing traditional roles but also creating new opportunities in tech-focused financial careers. This paradigm shift could demand a re-skilling of the workforce, aligning with broader technological adoption trends.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nAI\u2019s capability to analyze vast datasets and predict market trends with great accuracy offers a more stable investment environment. This stability can attract more participants into the market, increasing liquidity and potentially reducing the cost of capital. However, there\u2019s a nuanced economic debate regarding the power dynamics inherent in AI usage, where entities with superior AI technologies may dominate markets, possibly leading to monopolistic practices and requiring regulatory oversight to ensure fair competition.\n\nGlobal Implications\n\nLooking at the global trading landscape, AI\u2019s proliferation may democratize investment opportunities, granting more accessible entry to international markets. Consequently, as AI-driven tools empower individual investors with real-time data, the globalization of investment opportunities becomes more palatable, fostering economic interdependence and collaboration. This could play a crucial role in bridging economic disparities between developed and developing nations, thereby aligning with global sustainability goals.\n\nConnection to the Future of Humanity\n\nAI\u2019s continuous advancement signifies a pivotal transformation in human interaction with technology. Its integration into stock market dynamics, as illustrated by the HSBC example, mirrors broader trends likely to redefine various sectors. As AI refines predictive capabilities, its broader adoption may lead to an era characterized by greater economic stability and innovation, potentially paving the way for a future where financial inequality is reduced.\n\nOverall, as humanity navigates this technological frontier, the ethical and practical management of AI in finance will play a critical role in shaping not just markets, but the fabric of society itself. The challenges and opportunities presented by AI will set the stage for human societies to potentially achieve unprecedented prosperity, provided that these technological tools are deployed with strategic insight and foresight.\n\nRevolutionizing Stock Analysis: The AI Impact on HSBC\u2019s Trading Strategies\n\nOverview\n\nThe financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), offering new insights and strategic advantages, particularly in stock market analysis. With accelerated adoption across financial institutions, AI presents innovative methods for understanding the intricacies of stock performance, including HSBC\u2019s 0005 HK stock listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nInnovations in AI for Financial Markets\n\nMachine Learning Algorithms: AI has paved the way for enhanced analysis by employing machine learning algorithms to dissect massive datasets. This advancement allows for a refined understanding of market trends and predictive accuracy in stock price movements. Consequently, investors gain the ability to make informed real-time decisions, which traditionally relied heavily on static historical data.\n\nPredictive Analytics and Risk Mitigation: AI-driven trading platforms are at the forefront of financial technology, utilizing predictive analytics and adaptive algorithms to forecast market behaviors. This predictive power is critical in volatile market conditions, where traditional models may falter. The integration of AI reduces risks, offering stability and confidence to investors.\n\nPersonalized Financial Advising: AI\u2019s capabilities extend into the domain of personalized financial advising. By understanding individual investor preferences and risk profiles, AI can tailor bespoke investment solutions. This customization not only caters to personal financial goals but also enhances investor understanding of potential future pathways for stocks like HSBC\u2019s 0005 HK.\n\nMarket Analysis and AI Trends\n\nThe progression of AI technology continues to impact the financial ecosystem profoundly. AI\u2019s ability to analyze and predict stock market patterns is redefining conventional trading strategies. Financial districts worldwide, including the fast-paced markets of Hong Kong, are recognizing the advantages AI brings, fostering a symbiotic relationship poised to redefine future stock prediction models.\n\nAI innovations are expected to surge, with significant developments in AI-human collaboration in trading and advisory roles. This trend underscores a shift towards more dynamic and responsive financial systems that can adapt swiftly to market changes.\n\nSecurity and Ethical Considerations\n\nAs AI technology becomes more prevalent, ensuring the security of financial data becomes paramount. Financial institutions must prioritize cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information against breaches. Concurrently, addressing ethical considerations surrounding AI, such as bias and transparency, is crucial to maintain trust in AI-powered financial services.\n\nSustainability and Future Predictions\n\nThe sustainability of AI-driven financial tools lies in their capacity to evolve alongside changing market conditions. Advancements in AI are predicted to offer not only competitive advantages but also transformative opportunities in global finance, paving the way for more robust and resilient financial markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between AI and finance is setting the stage for a new era of stock trading and investment strategies. For stakeholders and investors in HSBC\u2019s 0005 HK stock, this presents a forward-thinking approach to financial growth, characterized by strategic insights and predictive precision. As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in reshaping financial markets is both inevitable and promising, representing a pivotal shift in how we approach the future of investing.\n\nFor more information on HSBC\u2019s latest financial strategies and insights, visit the official HSBC website.",

China has made a wave of coordinated policy changes in recent months. With external headwinds stiffening, I expect the government to redouble its efforts to spur domestic demand, including potentially expanding the scope of direct consumption stimulus. In addition, China is likely to increase the budget deficit, with the central government taking more proactive measures to bolster effective investment, including building a better social welfare system to stimulate sustainable growth in domestic consumption.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nHow will Malaysia\u2019s ASEAN 2025 Chairmanship steer regional economic prosperity?\n\nBy Omar Siddiq, CEO, Malaysia\n\nMalaysia\u2019s appointment as ASEAN Chair for 2025 signifies a prime opportunity to showcase the region as a key player in global investment and trade.\n\nASEAN offers diverse investment opportunities with a focus on key sectors like manufacturing, infrastructure, and digital innovation. Strengthening trade and investment activities across these sectors will be vital to elevating the region\u2019s economic landscape.\n\nResilience is crucial to Southeast Asia\u2019s development, with regional integration enabling product and service diversification to cater to a growing consumer market. Initiatives like an integrated payments system among ASEAN governments can deepen financial integration and economic cohesion within the bloc.\n\nBanks will remain crucial partners with governments to attract foreign investments, strengthen economic resilience and drive economic integration. Their collaboration is essential for advancing the region\u2019s international growth and supporting businesses investing in ASEAN.\n\nWith a longstanding presence in the ASEAN region for over a century, including Malaysia for more than 140 years, HSBC has been actively involved in supporting trade and financial services. These deep roots, and our strong global presence in 60 countries and territories, mean we are well-positioned to help clients capture opportunities in the region.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nHow will the Philippines economy fare in a digital world?\n\nBy Sandeep Uppal, CEO, Philippines\n\nGlobal trade in services has grown faster than trade in goods, enabled by digital technology making services more tradable. This is a wave the Philippines has captured with the local \u2018gig\u2019 economy and digitalisation weaving their way through the country\u2019s economic fabric. With a young (median age of 25), tech savvy and talented workforce, the economy can move up the global value chain, with receipts from services exports now outpacing overseas remittances.\n\nSince the pandemic, 3.4 million jobs have been created in the digital space, outpacing the 1.9 million non-digital jobs created. Women in particular have used e-commerce to expand trading, fueling growth in the economy. The country\u2019s business process outsourcing sector also continues to be a driver for growth, with BPO revenues neck-to-neck with India despite the latter\u2019s size. That said, the Philippines leads developing ASEAN when it comes to exporting \u2018light-asset\u2019 services.\n\nArtificial intelligence, however, poses a risk to the longevity of this growth driver. We think the Philippines can look at India\u2019s diversified services exports to build the resilience it needs. Giving opportunities to the Philippines\u2019 professionals and highly-skilled workers to extend their markets and service the rest of the world, further boosting the Philippines\u2019 potential.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nHow is Sri Lanka becoming a maritime and business process outsourcing hub?\n\nBy Mark Surgenor, CEO, Sri Lanka & Maldives\n\nSri Lanka is geographically well positioned to tap into significant maritime trading opportunities in 2025. Just 10 nautical miles away from the country\u2019s southern tip lies the world\u2019s busiest sea lane through which two-thirds of the global oil shipments pass through every year. Currently, only 6,000 of those ships berth in the three main ports in Sri Lanka. This is changing and changing fast.\n\nDeepwater port infrastructure is expanding significantly at several ports and Free Trade Zones (FTZs) are also fast developing alongside them. Transshipment volumes are on the rise boosted by the fact that nearly 30 per cent of India\u2019s growing maritime trade is handled through Sri Lanka. The tech Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector in Sri Lanka continues its capacity build to deliver world class services with a very competitive cost base. The country has invested steadily in skill development and technology, and this has fuelled a growth in the sector of 20 per cent annually. In 2025, Sri Lanka\u2019s skilled and English-speaking workforce is expected to continue to support this growth. Established firms in Sri Lanka are expanding into healthcare, agriculture, electric vehicle and education tech, supported by specific Special Economic Zone (SEZ) infrastructure.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nWhat challenges and opportunities does Taiwan face in fostering AI innovation and industrial development in 2025?\n\nBy Adam Chen, President & CEO, Taiwan\n\nTaiwan has always been a world leader in the semiconductor, ICT and other technology industries, with Taiwanese companies accounting for around 70 per cent of global semiconductor foundry market share and over 90 per cent of advanced chip segments.\n\nWe are currently entering a world empowered by AI, and the trend is irreversible. This will definitely bring up significant opportunities for Taiwan in 2025, given that Taiwan\u2019s market share of AI chip production below 7 nanometers stands at over 80 per cent.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s robust research and development ecosystems can also drive advancements in AI applications across different fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, and smart cities.\n\nIn the middle-to-long term, leveraging its strong development in semiconductor and technology industry to bolster the development of AI software and hardware, Taiwan will play a pivotal role in the global AI supply chain in the next 20 years.\n\nIn terms of challenges, issues relating to privacy and personal data protection and requirements to implement robust encryption methods to adhere to stringent data protection regulations, will be something that we will need to pay more attention, considering the critical role AI chips play in data processing and transmission. Moreover, integrating AI into industries may encounter pushback due to concerns about costs and implementation complexities. The management change associated with these challenges require strategic planning, stakeholder participation, and iterative implementations to optimise AI and minimise disruptions.\n\nIn summary, by fostering partnerships between startups and established businesses, Taiwan can stimulate creativity and drive industry growth. Overall, effectively leveraging these opportunities while addressing existing challenges will be essential for sustaining Taiwan\u2019s prominent role in the global AI landscape.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nWhat\u2019s on the horizon for fintech and new economy companies in Hong Kong?\n\nBy Luanne Lim, CEO, Hong Kong\n\nDigital innovation is crucial to securing Hong Kong\u2019s position as a global financial centre while driving economic growth through fintechs and new economy companies, including start-ups. Hong Kong currently ranks ninth globally as a fintech hub and third on the emerging start-up ecosystems list. The government has taken proactive steps, including policies to embrace frontier technologies, foster the digital economy, and attract global and local talent.\n\nThe city\u2019s strategic location serves as a gateway to both international markets and mainland China, and its status as one of the world\u2019s premier financial hubs adds to its appeal. Its world class universities provide a steady talent pipeline and foster research and development. With China hosting nine of the top and emerging startup ecosystems globally, Hong Kong is ideally positioned to serve as a launchpad for Chinese start-ups expanding internationally.\n\nIn November 2024, HSBC supported promising Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks companies in exploring expansion in Saudi Arabia. On the IPO front, activity is warming up. Chinese autonomous driving firm Horizon Robotics raised nearly USD700 million with its successful Hong Kong listing in October 2024, signaling more momentum is likely in 2025. These developments cement Hong Kong\u2019s role as a hub for innovation, talent, and business growth in a fast-evolving global economy.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nWhat will be Macau\u2019s positioning in the Greater Bay Area Region in 2025?\n\nBy Henry Chow, CEO, Macau\n\nMacau has played a significant role in facilitating China\u2019s international investments leveraging its proximity to neighboring Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities. This is evidenced by a 64 per cent increase in total wealth customer accounts, a 30 per cent growth in investment portfolios, and a 42 per cent rise in total Chinese corporate investments over the past three years.\n\nAs one of the two special administrative regions in China, Macau complements Hong Kong\u2019s global financial prominence while maintaining its unique city proposition. In 2025, Macau will continue to remain its dominant focus on tourism and leisure. On top of that, Macau will continue to serve as the bridge between Mainland China and Portuguese-speaking countries, fostering Sino-Lusophone corridors with trade, investment, and cultural exchanges. Macau also offers favorable business and policy incentives, attracting new corporate investment, capital and talent.\n\nOne of the focuses for the Macau financial sector in 2025 is to further develop its bond market. Initiated since 2018, Macau\u2019s bond market is rapidly growing, with efforts to broaden global investor participation. Up until 1H2024, 332 bonds valuing USD64.9 billion had been issued or listed in Macau, within which 15 per cent related to ESG finance offerings, marking a 34 per cent increase over the past five years.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nHow will Korea\u2019s inclusion in the World Government Bond Index impact the country\u2019s economy?\n\nBy Peter Kim, CEO, Korea\n\nIn October 2024, FTSE Russell announced Korea\u2019s inclusion in the World Government Bond Index (WGBI). This landmark decision has been widely welcomed by market participants and is expected to have far-reaching implications for the Korean economy.\n\nOne of the most notable impacts will be a sharp increase in global capital inflows into Korea Treasury Bonds (KTBs). This boost is anticipated to stabilise interest rates and enhance market liquidity.\n\nAt HSBC, we expect that WGBI inclusion will attract sizeable foreign investment ranging between USD55-65bn into the Korea Treasury Bond (KTB) market. The inclusion process, which will be carried out over 12 months starting November 2025, is projected to bring in an initial USD13.5-16.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining inflows are expected to materialize in 2026. We anticipate that it will account for approximately 80-90 per cent of the government\u2019s net bond issuance for that year.\n\nIncreased foreign capital inflows could reduce funding costs for the government and stabilise exchange rate as rising demand for Korean won is expected.\n\nAdditionally, WGBI inclusion could enhance Korea\u2019s international credibility, signaling that Korea has met global standards. This could pave the way for the country\u2019s potential future inclusion in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Developed Market Index.\n\nUltimately, we expect that this WGBI inclusion would position Korea as a key player in Asia\u2019s bond market, opening new opportunities for economic growth and financial innovation.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond\n\nWith supply chains on the move, how will Thailand\u2019s manufacturing renaissance take shape?\n\nBy Giorgio Gamba, CEO, Thailand\n\nThailand remains open for business. Exporting, may it be through goods or services, is ingrained and inseparable in Thailand\u2019s economic fabric. While global supply chains are currently in motion, Thailand is experiencing a resurgence of FDI interest. Using its reach and, most especially, its history of being ASEAN\u2019s first manufacturing powerhouse as leverage, Thailand, over the past two years, has attracted a record high in FDI applications of THB553bn (approx. USD15.5bn) in 2023 and THB546bn (approx. USD15.7bn) in 2024 Jan-Sept.\n\nFor instance, Thailand is first in mind in ASEAN when it comes to investing in electric vehicle production given its deep supply chains in manufacturing. The economy has been successful in attracting a vast amount of interest in data centers with Thailand having a considerably high supply of renewable energy across the ASEAN region.\n\nChinese companies are increasingly doing business in ASEAN as geopolitical tensions push international businesses to diversify their supply chains. Among our Chinese clients, Thailand stands out as one of the key markets of interest for expanding into ASEAN and is well-positioned for a manufacturing renaissance as supply chain shifts continue.\n\nSee more of our CEOs\u2019 thoughts on the issues shaping 2025 and beyond",

The private banking arms of Citigroup and HSBC Holdings also stopped lending on New World securities some months back, said the people.\n\nSpokespeople from UBS, HSBC and Citi declined to comment. Banks review such lending requirements regularly and the lending values could be subject to change.\n\nConcerns are growing over the financial state of the developer controlled by the family of Hong Kong tycoon Henry Cheng. New World is one of the most closely watched property firms due to its high leverage amid a prolonged property downturn.\n\nOn Monday (Jan 20), in a response to market speculation, the firm released a statement saying that it was not in any discussions on a \u201cholistic debt restructuring.\u201d It has offered properties valued at US$15 billion as collateral for loan refinancing, underscoring its increasingly onerous funding conditions, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\nNew World late last year asked banks to postpone the due dates of some bilateral loans. Some of the firm\u2019s bonds were on pace for their biggest daily decline since issuance on Monday, according to traders.\n\nAdrian Cheng, the third generation New World scion stepped down as chief executive officer in September after steering the developer to its first annual loss in two decades. Just months later, the firm replaced his successor.\n\nWealthy clients in Asia often take on leverage against securities to make investments. Banks typically consider the volatility of a security\u2019s price and its credit rating among factors when determining lending values. Private banks in the past two years have curbed margin funding on bonds of China property developers as that sector ran into turmoil. When a private bank cuts lending values to zero, clients typically have to top up with cash or another form of collateral and if they fail to do so, their securities can be liquidated. BLOOMBERG",

            "content": "(Jan 21): HSBC Holdings Plc is studying options for its consumer banking business in Australia, including a potential sale as the bank looks to further slim down its operations, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe UK lender is likely to retain its commercial banking operations in Australia to serve its corporate clients globally, one of the people said, who asked not to be identified as information is private. The consumer banking business \u2014 which consists of more than 40 branches and offices as well as its loan books and retail customers in Australia \u2014 could attract other major banks in the country, the person said.\n\nDeliberations are at an early stage and HSBC could decide against any deal, said the people. A representative for HSBC declined to comment.\n\nAny divestment would be part of new chief executive officer Georges Elhedery\u2019s sweeping overhaul that aims to simplify the nearly 160-year-old bank\u2019s businesses. The bank recently created a new Eastern regional unit that included the Asia-Pacific and Middle East, and a Western market that included its non-ring-fenced bank in the UK, Europe and the Americas. Hong Kong and the UK will be standalone units.\n\nHSBC has also explored selling various businesses in Germany including its wealth-management, custody and fund administration units, Bloomberg News reported last year. The UK bank completed a sale of its Canadian business to Royal Bank of Canada for US$10.1 billion (RM45 billion) in 2024 following its exit from loss-making consumer operations in France and the US.\n\nLocal operations\n\nHSBC established its operations in Australia in 1965 and obtained a commercial licence in 1986, according to its website. In November, the lender reported A$31.8 billion in mortgages on its books, along with A$516 million in credit cards and A$538 million in other household loans, according to disclosures filed with the regulator.\n\nAny transaction could be around US$1 billion and the four major Australian banks would be logical buyers if they had interest, according to Morningstar Inc\u2019s senior equity analyst Michael Makdad. The country\u2019s so-called big four have competed aggressively for years to win larger slices of the mortgage market.\n\n\u201cOutside the UK and the Hong Kong bank, HSBC is focusing now on wholesale banking rather than consumer banking,\u201d Makdad said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that they may want to sell the Australian consumer business to fit that strategy.\u201d\n\nThat industry has been consolidating in recent years. In 2022, Citigroup Inc sold its consumer unit in the country to National Australia Bank Ltd. ANZ Group Holdings Ltd, which will have former HSBC banker Nuno Matos become chief executive officer in July, completed its purchase of Suncorp Group Ltd\u2019s banking arm last year.",

Learn More .\n\nMaking money from financial investments is the truest form of passive income there is, in my view. Passive income means earnings generated with minimal effort, such as with dividends from shares or interest from bonds.\n\nThe only real effort involved is picking the right share or bond in the first place and then monitoring its progress periodically.\n\nMuch excitement has been seen recently from a spike in UK government bond yields. Those yields have jumped to around 4.7% on the benchmark 10-year bond, known as the \u2018risk-free rate\u2019.\n\nAs I have large holdings of these, I am as happy as the next bondholder. However, this does not mean that I will be moving all my money currently in stocks into these.\n\nShares chosen for their passive income potential can generate much greater returns than UK government bonds even now.\n\nThree qualities I want in passive income stocks\n\nThe first thing I want in passive income stocks is a yield significantly higher than the 10-year UK government bond. As a stock\u2019s yield moves in the opposite direction to its price, this will change frequently.\n\nThe second quality I look for is that a share seems very undervalued to me. This reduces the chance of my making a loss on the stock should I ever wish to sell it. This would effectively diminish the overall passive income I had made on the share.\n\nAnd the third element I require is that the business is strong enough to keep paying the high dividends.\n\nA prime example of these factors at play\n\nOn the first element, I bought HSBC (LSE: HSBA) shares when they yielded well over 7%. As the share price has soared since then, the yield has gone down to 5.9% now. That said, this has been more than compensated for by gains in the stock price if I wished to sell them.\n\nOn the second, a discounted cash flow analysis shows the shares are technically 55% undervalued, even after their rise. Given their present \u00a38.24 price, the fair value for them would be \u00a318.31. Market vagaries might push them lower or higher than that, but they still look full of value to me.\n\nAnd finally on business strength, a risk is that the recent decline in UK interest rates will reduce its net interest income. This is the difference between a bank\u2019s income from interest charged on loans and paid out on deposits.\n\nHowever, HSBC has shifted its strategy from interest-based to fee-based income. This resulted in Q3\u2019s pre-tax profit rising 9.9% to $8.48bn (\u00a36.95bn), way ahead of analysts\u2019 consensus of $7.6bn.\n\nHow much passive income can be made?\n\nInvestors considering a \u00a310,000 stake in HSBC would make \u00a38,014 in dividends after 10 years. And after 30 years, this would have risen to \u00a348,454.\n\nBy then, the total HSBC holding would be worth \u00a358,454, which would pay an annual passive income of \u00a33,449.\n\nThis is based on \u2018dividend compounding\u2019 being used and on an average 5.9% yield over the periods. Analysts forecast the yield will rise to 6.7% in 2025, 6.9% in 2026, and 7% in 2027 but there is no guarantee it will.\n\nGiven that all three factors that led me to buy in the first place are still in play, I will be buying more HSBC shares very soon.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against the other mega-cap stocks.\n\nThe US stock markets have gone up leading up to the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. All the major indices are set to continue their optimism from last week, when the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all reported gains of over 3.7%.\n\nEven though the S&P had hardly moved from its early November levels when the election happened, many mega-cap stocks continue to register 52-week highs. We looked at some of these stocks and why they are expected to continue surging up with the earnings season already underway.\n\nTo come up with our list of 10 mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs, we only considered stocks that have recently hit their 52-week highs and have a market cap of at least $150 billion.\n\nA financial specialist advising a corporate client at the trading desk of a high-stakes bank.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC)\n\nHSBC Holdings plc is a financial and banking services provider worldwide that operates through global banking and markets, wealth and personal banking, and commercial banking segments. The company\u2019s stock is on a dream run, gaining over 150% in 4 years. That run is likely to continue judging by the company\u2019s performance.\n\nThe bank\u2019s most recent earnings beat both the revenue and earnings consensus. The bank continues to reap the benefits of high interest rates. Even if the interest rates go down, the bank\u2019s global business is structured in such a way that it continues to reduce the sensitivity of its net interest margins to decreasing interest rates.\n\nThe stock\u2019s 6% dividend yield continues to attract more investors and forms the backbone of most people\u2019s investment thesis in the company.\n\nOverall HSBC ranks 8th on our list of the mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs. While we acknowledge the potential of HSBC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ(NYSE: IONQ) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and IonQ wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "Earnings misses by leading Indian technology services companies are raising concern that the sector will struggle to justify an US$11 billion (S$15 billion) rally since the US presidential election.\n\nValuations for the industries\u2019 stocks soared to as high as a record 34 times one-year forward earnings from about 27 times after Donald Trump\u2019s US presidential win spurred bets the companies would benefit from his pro-growth policies. Third-quarter earnings reports triggered a rethink, said Mr Manish Jain, head of fund management at Centrum Capital.\n\nWith a measure of technology stocks on course for a weekly decline of about 3 per cent, the sub-gauge hasn\u2019t outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 index since industry stalwart Tata Consultancy Services kicked off the earnings season on Jan 9. Infosys is the only firm so far to post profit that beat the average analyst estimate, but its sales forecast fell short of consensus.\n\n\u201cThe whole rally in the sector was built on hope and valuation comfort, and it looks like both factors are tapering off a bit,\u201d said Mumbai-based Mr Jain, who has recommended clients avoid the stocks. \u201cSlow growth coupled with high valuations is a bit concerning,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors had been banking on India\u2019s IT companies, which get most of their sales in the US, to benefit from Trump\u2019s business-friendly policies. Still, the recent earnings shortfalls have undermined optimism just days before the president-elect takes office, said Mr Dhananjay Sinha, co-head of equities at Systematix Group.\n\nThe cooling rally in technology stocks underscores risks to investors in India\u2019s equity market, with the sector accounting for more than 14 per cent of the Nifty 50. HSBC Holdings last week downgraded Indian shares to neutral, and consensus estimates for earnings growth from Nifty 50 companies declined to 5 per cent from earlier projections of 15 per cent.\n\nForward-looking indicators for the sector such as deal wins and employee additions remain weak \u201cfor almost every company in the sector\u201d, Citigroup analysts wrote in a note. The analysts retained a \u201ccautious\u201d view on the tech services sector in India due to margin pressure and a slower recovery in growth during coming quarters.\n\nTo be sure, technology stocks remain among preferred picks by funds and strategists, according to an informal Bloomberg survey, with expectations that lower interest rates and Trump\u2019s policies will buoy US clients\u2019 spending in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on domestic IT as a space among a weakening rupee, the US doing well and Trump policy formation,\u201d said Ms Ankita Pathak, chief global strategist at Angel One Wealth. But, she cautioned, some stocks with narrowing margins and stretched valuations may not be the greatest beneficiaries in the index.

            "content": "While the global economy isn't circling the drain, growth forecasts for 2025 are rather anemic \u2013 and that's if the fallout of a potential trade war doesn't wind up worse than expected. What's more, after two consecutive 20%-plus years for the S&P 500, a lot of value has already been priced in to stocks.\n\n\n\nAmid such an outlook, many investors are looking to reduce their risk profile through diversification. One way to diversify your portfolio is to add international stocks to lessen the impact of potential economic trouble in a single market.\n\nThe following picks are among the best international stocks to buy right now given their scale, stable operations and potential to supplement U.S. stocks:\n\n\n\nStock Market Cap ASML Holding NV (ticker: ASML) $298 billion HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) $180 billion Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) $351 billion Nestle SA (OTC: NSRGY) $208 billion SAP SE (SAP) $307 billion Tencent Holdings Ltd. (OTC: TCEHY) $454 billion Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) $237 billion\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML)\n\nA provider of advanced equipment for chipmakers, ASML is a Netherlands-based company that is essential to global supply chains thanks to its critical role in measuring and inspecting semiconductors. It should go without saying that any significant waste or delays for chipmakers costs real time and money, making ASML a valued partner for major semiconductor firms. That gives it a strong and reliable revenue stream.\n\nSemiconductor markets can sometimes be volatile based on global pricing and demand trends. As an added bonus, the nature of this company as a service provider to the industry gives it a degree of insulation from broader chipmaking economics.\n\nHSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC)\n\nLondon-based megabank HSBC may be recognizable to some U.S. consumers, but elsewhere, it is a well-known name that provides banking and financial services worldwide. Like other major enterprises in the sector, it operates a diversified business, including personal and commercial banking, wealth management and capital markets segments.\n\nOver the last year, HSBC has outperformed the S&P 500, with a generous 4% yield on top of share appreciation. That rate is significantly higher than many U.S. peers in the financial sector and considerably above the 1.4% paid by S&P 500 components, on average. If you want to look beyond the U.S. for a leading financial stock, HSBC is worth a look.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO)\n\nDenmark-based Novo Nordisk is a pharmaceutical stock with the perfect specialty for 2025: diabetes and obesity care. It also provides treatments for rare blood and endocrine system disorders, but this focus is clearly the bread-and-butter of NVO, with blockbusters like its recent Wegovy treatment that just topped $2.5 billion in sales for Q3, up 48% from the previous quarter.\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

Open An Account View Disclosure\n\nShares have softened up a bit lately as many investors were front-running the success of this treatment and now most of the growth is priced into Novo Nordisk stock. But the durable revenue from diabetes products provides a firm foundation, and the proven drug pipeline of this century-old pharma leader makes it one of the best international stocks to buy for 2025.\n\n\n\nNestle SA (OTC: NSRGY)\n\nFounded in 1866 and one of the biggest consumer staples stocks on the planet, Switzerland-based Nestle is a reliable and profitable company, and thus worth attention from all global investors. Shares have been soft the last few years in part due to a focus on healthier eating in the West that has weighed on the sales of processed foods.\n\nBut the reality is that Nestle's Kit-Kat chocolates, H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, Hot Pockets frozen foods and other products are consistently in shopping carts and have strong baseline demand even if they have a modest growth outlook. If you're looking for stability, you can't go wrong with this massive consumer leader.\n\nSAP SE (SAP)\n\nGerman enterprise software giant SAP has digital solutions for businesses across a host of categories, from customer relationship management tools to supply chain and logistics to human resources. The company has been aggressively investing in cloud services over the past few years, and like many modern tech stocks, it now has tremendously reliable revenue thanks to a software-as-a-service model.\n\nAt roughly $300 billion in market value and a slower growth rate than flashy small-cap AI and crypto plays, SAP isn't as dynamic as some other technology firms out there. But with free cash flow that is on pace to top $4 billion this fiscal year, this software leader has a firm foundation that will serve investors well.\n\nTencent Holdings Ltd. (OTC: TCEHY)\n\nSometimes referred to as the Google of China, Tencent is a digital titan that dominates the Asian tech landscape. It's valued at about $450 billion, and it has varied business lines including online advertising, mobile payments, video streaming, web browser software, cloud computing, big data analytics and artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the end of 2024, China's central government signaled plans for aggressive stimulus efforts to spur consumer demand, and the nation's central bank said it will loosen monetary policy. With entrenched operations related closely to broader spending trends, Tencent is a natural recipient of these measures. In the long term, you can't find a more dominant tech stock in the region.\n\nToyota Motor Corp. (TM)\n\nJapanese auto giant Toyota ranks as the No. 1 automaker in the world with about 11 million vehicles sold in 2023. With operations in every market and a wide product portfolio, this industry leader has both the know-how and the capital to remain relevant in an evolving environment.",

US equity futures were little changed.The downward start in Asia comes as a global risk rally this week, sparked by traders re-adjusting Federal Reserve interest rate cut bets following Wednesday\u2019s benign inflation data, loses steam. The focus will now shift to official Chinese data due Friday that is likely to show the world\u2019s second-largest economy failed to break a deflationary cycle last year.\u201cStimulus, stimulus, stimulus, particularly on the fiscal side, is very much needed in China,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in other economies a big policy push is needed to permanently get out of disinflation. And that\u2019s something we think will gradually happen in China, but very gradually indeed.\u201dWhile growth in China is still expected to have expanded at a faster clip in real terms in the final quarter, the gross domestic product deflator \u2014 the broadest measure of price changes in an economy \u2014 will reach minus 0.2% in 2025, according to the median forecast of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg.Although the numbers may be enough for authorities to say they met their economic growth target of around 5%, \u201cwe expect the data to show that the Chinese economy remains soft,\u201d Kristina Clifton, a senior economist and currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote. That \u201cwill likely reinforce expectations of policy support, keeping downward pressure on Chinese interest rates\u201d and the yuan.Adding to volatility in Chinese assets on Friday, China Vanke Co.\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Zhu Jiusheng was taken away by police, the Economic Observer reported, citing unidentified sources. A task force sent by the local government of Shenzhen, where the state-backed developer is based, has stepped in to run the company and it may be taken over or restructured, according to the report.Meantime, Asian chip stocks will be in focus after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.In currencies, the dollar was steady in early trading. The yen slipped, though has still climbed more than 1% against the greenback this week amid speculation the Bank of Japan could hike its key rate next week. Some 74% of economists forecast a rate increase at the meeting, according to the latest Bloomberg survey, rising from 52% in the previous poll.Treasuries were steady after rising Thursday as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC that officials could lower rates again in the first half of 2025 if inflation data continue to be favorable. He also wouldn\u2019t entirely rule out a cut in March. Swap trading implied a little bit more easing this year. Australian bonds edged higher Friday.\u201cThe December US inflation print was just what the doctor ordered to cure markets of their recent FOMC fear frenzy,\u201d said Damian McIntyre, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. \u201cWe expect to see inflation continue to fall on a year-over-year basis in the first few months of 2025.\u201dAs traders waded through corporate earnings, Thursday\u2019s US economic data was mixed. Homebuilders grew less upbeat about sales prospects, while retail sales figures pointed to a consumer that held up well in the holiday season.\u201cIn the coming weeks, the fourth-quarter earnings season will provide investors with an opportunity to shift some attention from macro to micro data,\u201d said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cWe continue to have an attractive view on US equities.\u201dIn commodities, oil was little changed after a 1.7% drop on Thursday, retreating from a five-month high as the market adjusts to new sanctions on Russian crude and digested mixed signals from President-elect Donald Trump on his intent to uphold the measures.

            "content": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors in Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc voted overwhelmingly to scrap UK bonus caps for investment bankers and traders at their annual general meetings this month. Shareholders haven\u2019t been hypnotized by money-mad rainmakers, nor are they falling over themselves to throw more of their share of profits at employees. Quite the opposite: They voted to claw back greater control of costs and risks by making pay more flexible and allowing more of it to be deferred for longer.\n\nAmong US banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has already told staff it will be getting rid of the bonus limit in the UK, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reviewing its policy, according to Bloomberg News. It\u2019s a fair bet that peers will follow suit, consigning the cap to history before long.\n\nWith investment banking fees recovering strongly this year, predictions of higher bonuses have logically followed, generating easy headlines about windfalls for overpaid bankers. Indeed, Britain\u2019s umbrella group for trade unions called on UK banks not to follow the lead set by Goldman Sachs while so many hard-pressed families struggle with a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple, and scrapping the cap is the right thing to do. It will be complicated for banks to change the structure of how they pay material risk-takers and convince some of them to sign up for deep cuts to basic salaries, because for some the upshot could be a drop in total income in the years ahead.\n\nLimiting bonuses in Europe and the UK was always a triumph of political posturing over practical impact. After the 2008 financial crisis, people wanted to see bankers punished for taking too much risk and leaving taxpayers with the bill, while everyone was looking for ways to make such a disaster less likely in future. Hitting the industry in the wallet seemed a quick way to quell public anger and end casino capitalism.\n\nHowever, plenty of non-politicians, including UK regulators, foresaw the obvious unintended consequence. Restricting bonuses to 100% of base salary (or 200% with direct shareholder assent) just meant fixed pay rose significantly. In Europe, average base salaries more than doubled and, in one infamous case, the highest-ranking Citigroup Inc. executive based in London, Paco Ybarra, saw his fixed salary balloon to more than five times that of his boss, Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser.\n\nRemember that a key aim of going after pay in the financial sector was to discourage excessive risk-taking and forestall another major economic crisis. The actual effect was precisely the opposite: Traders were guaranteed a much bigger slice of their income no matter what happened with their bets, paid immediately and in cash.\n\nA far better way to stop traders swinging for the fences when they\u2019re putting a bank\u2019s money on the line is to defer more of their rewards for longer. That way, executives, shareholders and regulators get to see the full consequence of bankers\u2019 actions before their compensation as been awarded, taxed \u2014 and spent.\n\nIn the US, some regulators are making a third attempt since 2011 to force larger banks to defer as much as 60% of bonuses for as long as four years, a much more effective way of mitigating risk. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little chance of this being adopted, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, because the proposal isn\u2019t backed by the Federal Reserve or the Securities and Exchanges Commission. It\u2019s being led by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whose reputation has been severely damaged by a deepening scandal over workplace misconduct.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see the bonus cap scrapped in Europe at some point, too. The bloc\u2019s biggest banks will be campaigning for that because they must obey European rules on pay in every market around the world \u2014 US and UK banks, in contrast, only satisfy requirements for employees based on the continent.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said on Bloomberg TV recently that the UK move would put the German lender at a competitive disadvantage outside Europe. The regulatory differences could make it harder for European investment banks to attract the top traders and dealmakers who expect to bring substantial revenue into their firms and get the rewards for doing so. At the same time, it could make it much easier to keep those bankers who are less senior or less certain about how much business they\u2019ll get credit for.\n\nBut von Moltke and other European bank CFOs will be left struggling with the higher base of fixed costs compared with US and UK peers. That\u2019s the real competitive disadvantage they\u2019ll worry about most.\n\nIn the UK, scrapping the bonus cap is one of the few real benefits of Brexit the government can claim, although it probably wouldn\u2019t be the most politically astute move. It at least gives banks another reason to resist the pull of moving individual bankers to Europe and so could protect Britain\u2019s income-tax take from the sector. But it\u2019s UK bank investors that are getting the best chance to take back control.\n\nMore from this writer at Bloomberg Opinion:\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nPaul J.

Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, Raytheon Technologies is one of the world's largest aerospace and defense manufacturers by revenue and market capitalization. The company is also one of the largest providers of intelligence services. Gregory J. Hayes is the chairman and CEO of the combined company.\n\nRaytheon Company was founded in 1922. The original location for the company was Cambridge, Massachusetts. Vannevar Bush, Laurence K. Marshall and Charles G. Smith originally started Raytheon as the American Appliance Company.\n\nRaytheon Manufacturing Company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company in 1925. After the name change, Raytheon Manufacturing Company began marketing its rectifier. During World War II, Raytheon designed and built magnetron tubes for microwave radar sets. It later went on to construct complete radar systems.\n\nRaytheon's Percy Spencer invented the microwave oven in 1945. While eating lunch, he discovered that the magnetron could rapidly heat food. Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics in 1959 and after the acquisition, the company changed its name to Raytheon Company.\n\nIn 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon's Patriot missile received great international exposure, increasing sales for the company outside the United States.

While no final decision has been reached on the incentives, the internal guidance so far is that the bonus award is likely to disappoint in coming weeks, they said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nA spokeswoman for HSBC said the board remuneration committee will make variable decisions in the first quarter \u201cbased on our full-year performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring our employees are rewarded fairly and to attracting and retaining talent in each of the markets we operate,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe deliberations over the awards come months after HSBC said its pay pool would be \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with the US$3.8 billion in bonuses it paid out in 2023.\n\nSince taking the helm in September, chief executive officer Georges Elhedery has kicked off a sweeping revamp of Europe\u2019s largest bank, arguing a new structure would provide the company with a \u201cclear competitive advantage and the greatest opportunity to grow.\u201d He\u2019s already announced the merger of commercial and investment banking outside of Hong Kong, axing layers of senior management.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.

That would represent a roughly 10 per cent cut in the bank\u2019s expense bill, which is estimated to be around US$32.6 billion for the year, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe bank is expected to provide details of the financial impact of its restructuring plans, including a one-time charge tied to that work, alongside its full-year results next month.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts said last month that HSBC\u2019s cost-cutting could be \u201cdialled up\u201d to provide a greater boost to profits. In particular, the analysts expect to see more cuts to the bank\u2019s US$19 billion annual wage bill, which makes up the bulk of its expenses.\n\nTop executives who have exited so far include Annabel Spring, global head of private banking, Celine Herweijer, group sustainability officer, Stephen Moss, head of the Middle East, North Africa and Turkiye, and Colin Bell, who ran the bank in Europe.

Secure financial solutions are essential to enabling smooth cross-border transactions as companies actively extend international markets. Along with this, the increasing reliance on e-commerce platforms allows businesses of all sizes to participate in global trade, further supporting market expansion. Moreover, governance policies and regulatory frameworks are playing an important role in elevating the market. International agreements, promotion programs, export credit agencies, etc., are examples of initiatives that offer financial guarantees, reduce risks, and promote involvement from companies throughout the globe. The exports through the foreign direct investment project were presented in November 2024 by the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) partnered with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission. This project, which is a component of the ITFC's Trade Connect Central Asia+ (TCCA+) Program, aimed to increase demand for trade finance solutions by elevating export growth among OIC member countries, thereby stimulating regional trade cooperation and assisting sustainable development.\n\nIn line with these advances, technological innovation is changing the trade finance scenario. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave KredX final approval to deploy its TReDS platform, DTX, in January 2025. This platform directly manages important trade financing matters by increasing MSMEs' liquidity, boosting transaction transparency, guaranteeing regulatory compliance, etc. DTX is anticipated to significantly increase transaction volumes and strengthen the trade finance ecosystem by combining domestic and international trade platforms. These developments, supported by innovation, collaborative initiatives, and government backing, underscore the dynamic growth trajectory of the trade finance market.\n\nGlobal Trade Finance Market Statistics, By Region\n\nThe market research report has also provided a comprehensive analysis of all the major regional markets, which include North America (the United States and Canada); Asia Pacific (China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia, and others); Europe (Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Russia, and others); Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and others); and the Middle East and Africa. According to the report, North America dominates the market due to strong financial institutions, developed digital infrastructure, active international trade, etc.\n\nNorth America Trade Finance Market Trends:\n\nNorth America is the largest market in the trade finance sector, and it is increasingly driven by blockchain technology and digitalization. For instance, the US's use of IBM's TradeLens technology has lessened processing time and simplified cross-border financing and logistics. Along with this, the region also places a strong emphasis on SME financing, with Canada implementing initiatives like Export Development Canada's trade credit insurance to shield exporters from payment risks. Furthermore, these developments lessen reliance on conventional manual procedures while promoting global trade.\n\nEurope Trade Finance Market Trends:\n\nEurope focuses on sustainable trade finance driven by green initiatives. Germany has led efforts by offering green trade finance products, such as the Deutsche Bank guarantees for renewable energy exports. Additionally, the European Investment Bank collaborates with other regional institutions to invest in eco-friendly projects. This shift aligns with Europe\u2019s climate goals and boosts export competitiveness, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles and sustainable manufacturing.\n\nAsia Pacific Trade Finance Market Trends:\n\nIn Asia Pacific, the market is driven by the surge in intraregional trade with the help of digital trade financing platforms. Consistent with this, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative has facilitated trade funding for infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia, including Vietnam\u2019s logistics growth. Additionally, India\u2019s Trade Receivables Discounting System platform has enhanced SME access to operating capital, eliminating delays in trade payments. This increase in digitization strengthens trade relations both inside and outside the region, further catalyzing industry growth.\n\nLatin America Trade Finance Market Trends:\n\nThe industry of trade finance in Latin America is driven by factors such as the digitalization of financial services, increased cross-border trade, government initiatives to support exports, etc. In parallel to this, emerging technologies like blockchain are enhancing transparency in transactions. Supporting this trend, financial associations are expanding credit facilities to small and medium enterprises to facilitate trade participation. Besides this, regional trade agreements and collaborations are fostering greater connectivity and opportunities for businesses across diverse industries.\n\nMiddle East and Africa Trade Finance Market Trends:\n\nClosing the trade finance gap is a top priority for the Middle East and Africa. Nigeria increased trade opportunities by securing USD 500 Million to finance agricultural exports through collaborations with the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation. Moreover, digital platforms are being adopted by regional banks to increase trade finance efficiency. Correspondingly, trade integration and financial access are further promoted throughout the MEA by initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area.\n\nTop Companies Leading in the Trade Finance Industry\n\nSome of the leading trade finance market companies include Asian Development Bank, Banco Santander SA, Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Euler Hermes, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered Bank, Wells Fargo & Co., among many others. For instance, in December 2022, Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group Inc. announced the completion of a USD 54.1 Million sustainable trade finance facility for Tata Power. It has extended this funding for the purchase of two solar power projects from TP Kirnali Limited (TPKL).\n\nGlobal Trade Finance Market Segmentation Coverage\n\nOn the basis of the finance type, the market has been bifurcated into structured trade finance, supply chain finance, and traditional trade finance, wherein supply chain finance represented the largest segment as it helps in saving funds, boosting productivity, and mitigating risks within complex global supply chains.\n\nBased on the offering, the market is categorized into letters of credit, bill of lading, export factoring, insurance, and others, amongst which letters of credit accounted for the largest market share as they provide a secure method for international trade transactions by ensuring that payment will be made to the seller upon the presentation of compliant shipping documents.\n\nOn the basis of the service provider, the market has been divided into banks and trade finance houses.

            "content": "QuantumScape Corporation is a U.S.-based technology development company focused on solid-state technology for the EV industry. Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme and Fritz Prinz, a trio from Stanford University, formed the company in 2010.\n\n\n\nThe company quickly gained major investors' attention. By 2012, it claimed investors like Bill Gates and Volkswagen. The company's solid-state battery technology piqued their interest as technology that will revolutionize the EV market by providing extended ranges and significantly reduced charge times at a lower cost to manufacturers.\n\n\n\nVolkswagen is the company's largest shareholder and has injected millions into the company over its lifespan. The first round came in 2012 but was followed by a $100 million investment in 2018 and another $200 million in 2020. The two now have a joint venture to produce commercial solid-state batteries, and that venture made significant progress in 2022. The technology has two key features: an anode-less architecture and a proprietary ceramic separator.\n\n\n\nQuantumScape went public in 2020 via a reverse merger with SPAC Kensington Capital Acquisition Company. The IPO listed the stock on the NYSE and raised $1 billion in capital for the company. The money funded operations and research that led to prototypes of commercially viable solid-state batteries for the EV market. The target is to increase the range of EVs by as much as 80%, which would give them more range than most ICE vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe company uses solid electrodes and electrolytes instead of the liquids and gels used by legacy batteries like lithium-ion. These batteries provide more than double the energy density of traditional batteries at lower costs and can charge to near full capacity in a matter of minutes. Solid state also increases the lifespan of the batteries and reduces capacity fade or the tendency for batteries to lose capacity over time. Another bonus is combustibility. While traditional batteries are prone to combustion, the solid-state separator is neither flammable nor combustible.\n\n\n\nThe company began shipping its 24-layer lithium-metal battery prototypes to OEMs in late 2022. The company believes the technology is suitable for various applications, including EVs and consumer electronics. At the time, there was still substantial work to be done before the widespread use of the batteries could begin, but the news marked a major milestone that could accelerate the advancement of the technology.\n\n\n\nAccording to the company's CEO, Singh, the \"E\" in ESG has always been central to the company's strategy. The mission should accelerate the shift to electrification and greener technologies by improving battery technology. Once perfected, this technology could be used across the consumer and industrial landscape, providing increased range and reducing the need for backup, carbon-based power sources.\n\nWritten by Jeffrey Neal Johnson",

Even so, surging exports and an improvement in home sales and retail spending probably provided enough of a spark to help meet Beijing\u2019s growth target of around 5% last year.\n\nA looming trade war with the US could make China\u2019s plight worse if exporters have to find domestic buyers in the face of obstacles abroad. The data on Friday, which will also give a snapshot of the troubled property market and retail sector, comes just days before Donald Trump returns to the White House threatening tariffs as high as 60% that could decimate trade with the world\u2019s No. 2 economy.\n\n\u201cStimulus, stimulus, stimulus, particularly on the fiscal side, is very much needed in China,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in other economies a big policy push is needed to permanently get out of disinflation. And that\u2019s something we think will gradually happen in China, but very gradually indeed.\u201d\n\nWhile growth is still expected to have expanded at a faster clip in real terms in the final quarter, the gross domestic product deflator \u2014 the broadest measure of price changes in an economy \u2014 will reach minus 0.2% in 2025, according to the median forecast of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg. That compares with 3.4% on average in the decade before the pandemic.\n\nDeflation persisted for the second straight year in 2024, official data due Friday is set to show, according to most economists. Some of the biggest Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are predicting it will linger through 2025 \u2014 marking a stretch unseen since the end of Mao Zedong\u2019s Great Leap Forward campaign, which plunged China into recession and caused a famine that killed tens of millions.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- China has failed to break a deflationary cycle and is now on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s, analysts say, exposing a key vulnerability likely masked by a growth upswing at the end of last year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut in a reflection of a persistent imbalance between domestic production and weak demand, growth in industrial output probably outpaced a rebound in retail sales. Property investment has been in contraction for over two years and almost certainly plunged again to end 2024.\n\n\u201cOne structural feature of China\u2019s economy is that many firms are willing and able to maintain, or even expand, output and capacity in circumstance of low or negative profitability,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cThings won\u2019t quickly change on this front.\u201d\n\nThe GDP deflator likely stayed in negative territory during the October-December period for the seventh straight quarter, matching the previous record set during the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s.\n\nThe gauge, which measures the difference between China\u2019s nominal and real GDP growth, is set to improve to 0.9% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027, Bloomberg\u2019s poll showed.\n\n\u201cA negative GDP deflator, or weak nominal GDP growth, will hurt the economy directly via weak corporate profits and weak fiscal revenue, and indirectly with weak income growth,\u201d said Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan.\n\nWhile the topic remains all but taboo among domestic analysts, fears of entrenched price declines have been on display in the Chinese bond market as yields slump to an all-time low.\n\nAnd behind closed doors around Beijing and in public, economists are saying China needs to tackle low inflation or put more focus on prices and nominal growth.\n\nDeflation can be a silent killer of commerce and consumption over the long haul. Even though cheaper goods may seem appealing, the danger is people could delay purchases because they expect prices to fall further.\n\nWeaker consumer spending would then erode income for businesses, which in turn would reduce hiring and investment \u2014 resulting in a vicious cycle.\n\nOfficials have yet to show the kind of determination economists say is needed to combat deflation, even though they are preparing more expansionary policies this year including a wider budget deficit ratio and more interest rate cuts.\n\nTop leaders only made a veiled acknowledgment of the problem last month when they pledged to keep prices \u201coverall stable\u201d in 2025 at an agenda-setting conference. Central bank Governor Pan Gongsheng called \u201clow prices\u201d a challenge in a speech this week.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\u201cDecember data will likely show the Chinese economy hitting the 5% growth goal right on target, but that momentum was soft toward the year end. There could be some speeding up in investment, reflecting front-loading ahead of the Lunar New Year in January and the government\u2019s growth measures.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Chang Shu, chief Asia economist, and David Qu, economist. For full analysis, click here\n\nWhile China has long set its annual inflation target at 3%, that\u2019s regarded more as a ceiling than a serious goal. Consumer inflation, which ended 2024 with a mere 0.2% gain from a year earlier, could lose its cyclical support from pork prices that rose throughout last year, according to Citigroup.\n\nA growing number of economists are calling on Beijing to set a binding target for inflation at 2%, and anchor its policies around achieving that aim. Such a practice, commonly adopted by advanced economies, would help shape the expectations of individuals and companies, Wu Ge, chief economist at Changjiang Securities, said at a public event last week.\n\nDeflationary pressure has been most pronounced in housing and manufacturing so far this year, while sectors like hotels and catering saw price gains \u2014 an indication of more resilient services demand. Economists at Natixis predict the services sector could suffer more downward price pressure in 2025 because of slower wage growth.\n\nGlobal commodities costs are also likely to be under strain, which would put a lid on producer prices in China after they declined for more than two years, according to BNP Paribas SA.\n\n\u201cIndustries that have undergone brutal price competition will likely see some exits by weaker players this year. This will help profit margins and selling prices recover,\u201d said Erica Tay, an economist with Maybank Investment Banking Group.\n\nBut \u201cas long as domestic demand stays soft, the price recovery will be gradual,\u201d she said.\n\n--With assistance from Cynthia Li.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, HSBC Holdings plc (LON:HSBA) shareholders have seen the share price rise 54% over three years, well in excess of the market decline (3.6%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 48%, including dividends.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for HSBC Holdings\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHSBC Holdings was able to grow its EPS at 32% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 15% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 7.58 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nLSE:HSBA Earnings Per Share Growth January 14th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for HSBC Holdings the TSR over the last 3 years was 90%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that HSBC Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 48% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand HSBC Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for HSBC Holdings (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.",

This long-term collaboration underscores the KTSP and HSBC\u2019s commitment to supporting Hong Kong\u2019s vibrant culture and mega-event economy.\n\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, commonly abbreviated as HSBC and formerly known as the HongkongBank, is the Hong Kong-based Asia-Pacific subsidiary of the HSBC Banking Group for which it was the parent entity until 1991. The largest bank in Hong Kong, the HSBC operates branches and offices throughout the Indo-Pacific Region and in other countries around the world.\n\nThe 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Sports Park is a multipurpose sports venue that is being built at the site of the former Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon, Hong Kong, as part of the Kai Tak Development. The sports park will be located on the North Western part of the old Kai Tak Airport where some of the parking stands used to be. With an area of around 28 hectares, the Kai Tak Sports Park anchors the redevelopment of the former airport site and offers a world-class destination for all interests.\n\n\u2018KAI TAK SPORTS PARK\u2019 further stated that the partnership was unveiled recently at the KTSP and HSBC Partnership Launch Ceremony held at the Kai Tak Stadium in KTSP with notable attendees including George TSOI Kin-Pan, Commissioner for Sports, Hong Kong, Luanne LIM, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HSBC Hong Kong, Gilbert HO, Co-CEO of Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited, Executive Director and Group Co-CEO of NWS Holdings Limited (a Hong Kong-based engineering and construction company that specializes in infrastructure, logistics and financial services) and John Sharkey, Project Director of Kai Tak Sports Park Limited. Through this long-term collaboration, the KTSP and the HSBC aspire to build a dynamic community and are committed to bringing more world-class cultural, sports and entertainment events to Hong Kong.\n\nStated Sharkey, \u201cAs the home venue for Hong Kong we sincerely thank the HSBC for becoming the Premier Founding Partner of the Kai Tak Sports Park. By leveraging Kai Tak Sports Park\u2019s world-class multipurpose facilities we will have international sports and entertainment events. This collaboration aims to develop a platform that boosts the City\u2019s reputation and economic activity in this sector transforming Hong Kong into an Event Capital by injecting continuous new momentum into our local economy.\u201d\n\nAdded LIM, \u201cI am proud that we are able to support such an incredible landmark. The KTSP not only reflects Hong Kong\u2019s success on the global stage but also serves as a vibrant hub for our community. I look forward to welcoming our international clients to the Cathay/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens (a Rugby Sevens tournament held annually in Hong Kong on a weekend in late March or early April) at the 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium in March. This partnership also aligns with our upcoming celebration of 160 years in Hong Kong. We are excited to partner with the KTSP to enhance Hong Kong\u2019s presence in international sports and entertainment.\u201d\n\nThe Rugby Sevens (commonly known as simply Sevens and originally known as seven-a-side rugby) is a variant of rugby union in which teams are made up of seven players playing seven-minute halves instead of the usual 15 players playing 40-minute halves. The Rugby Sevens is administered by World Rugby, the body responsible for rugby union worldwide.\n\n\n\n\u2018Championing Hong Kong\u2019 Partnership Programme\n\nThrough sponsorship and strategic collaboration the HSBC will support the KTSP in promoting community sports development and working together to build a healthier and more connected community for all. This program includes the construction of Hong Kong\u2019s first outdoor AirBadminton Court at the Kai Tak Mall, a variant that follows similar rules to traditional badminton but uses specially designed wind-resistant shuttlecocks.\n\nThe community program alignment between the KTSP and the HSBC brings opportunity for community activities such as rugby and AirBadminton competitions promoting sports for everyone and raising awareness of the benefit of a physically active lifestyle. The KTSP will further leverage Hong Kong\u2019s advantages as a Host City providing more citizens with the opportunity to experience the resilience of the Hong Kong athletes first-hand. At the same time, it will cultivate the next generation\u2019s involvement in sports allowing them to showcase their talents on the international stage.\n\nBoth the KTSP and the HSBC will leverage their strengths to collaborate in five key areas for creating unique experiences: Brand integrations, win-win business opportunities, marketing and communications, community engagement, and premium hospitality offerings. These efforts are designed to deliver an exceptional experience for all the guests. Additionally, the HSBC plans to establish a flagship branch and ATM services in Kowloon East at KTSP providing convenient access for the Kai Tak community as well as the local and the international visitors.\n\nThe major facilities of the KTSP are expected to be completed in phases by the end of 2024 with a grand opening planned for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.

            "content": "Watch BNN Bloomberg live.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration promises to usher in an era of upheaval in global commerce, forcing governments around the world to scramble in preparation for a tariff onslaught even before he\u2019s back in the White House.\n\nSoon after calls to congratulate the president-elect on his Nov. 5 victory, officials began quietly looking for ways to appease him while simultaneously mapping out ways to retaliate if needed.\n\nThe threat to China is longstanding, meaning its leaders have had ample time to prepare defenses and retaliatory strategies. But this time around, Trump and the trade hawks he\u2019s enlisted are broadening their scope in what threatens to be a more prolonged and unpredictable trade war than during his first presidency.\n\nMexico and Canada have borne much of the brunt of Trump\u2019s trade threats since election day, prompting leaders from both American neighbors to publicly warn of retaliation. Others are making preparations behind the scenes \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s officials have promised to buy more US goods, the European Union has bolstered its ability to counter tariffs, while Indian officials aim to negotiate their way through the coming storm.\n\n\u201cTrump 2.0 trade policy seems to be much more radical compared to 1.0,\u201d says Yeo Han-koo , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former South Korean trade minister. \u201cIt\u2019s like a prisoner\u2019s dilemma \u2014 the best scenario for all these countries is to band together and then resist, but there\u2019s a motivation for each country to race to get a better deal compared to your competitors.\u201d\n\nIf implemented, Trump\u2019s threats to increase levies on Chinese goods to 60% and to 20% for the rest of the world would transform the structure of global trade flows away from the US, according to Bloomberg Economics. Retaliation would exacerbate the shock.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum warned of the hit to US inflation in response to Trump\u2019s 25% tariff threats. The country has been quietly rolling out a strategy to reduce reliance on China. Developed over the last few months, the government\u2019s plan includes tapping major automakers about sourcing components elsewhere.\n\nLaw enforcement kicked off a country-wide \u201ccleaning operation\u201d with a raid on a Mexico City shopping complex filled with Chinese goods in November. The following week, Mexico announced its biggest-ever seizure of fentanyl pills, a drug Trump says is being smuggled into the US from its southern neighbor.\n\nMexico is set to scale up such efforts, carrying out searches for goods that entered the country without proper taxation. To that end, Mexico slapped 19% tariffs on goods imported through courier companies, a move that analysts said targets major e-retailers Temu and Shein.\n\n\u201cIf we coordinate on this, there won\u2019t be any tariffs,\u201d Sheinbaum said about working with the US in late November.\n\nIn Canada, outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to meet with Trump days after his 25% tariff threat. Following Trump\u2019s suggestion that its northern neighbor become America\u2019s 51st state, Trudeau shot back there\u2019s not a \u201csnowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of that happening.\n\nHow the country approaches Trump has been thrown in limbo with Trudeau\u2019s resignation. Behind the scenes, officials are examining export taxes on major commodities it sends to the US in a move that would drive up American prices.\n\nWhen Trump enacted levies on $200 billion in imports from China in 2018-2019, Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries as exports to the US more than doubled. Up to 16% of the increase in 2021 alone was a result of rerouting of goods to avoid US tariffs on China, according to a Harvard Business School white paper.\n\nNow, Vietnam \u2014 which has the fourth-biggest trade surplus with the US after China, Mexico and Canada \u2014 appears to be in Trump\u2019s sights. His trade adviser Peter Navarro called out the country by name in Project 2025, a right-wing policy blueprint.\n\nVietnam\u2019s leaders in recent months have made efforts to balance the relationship between China and the US. The country\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs has vowed to buy more aircraft, liquefied natural gas and other products while Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has emphasized the need to \u201cremove all remaining obstacles\u201d with the US.\n\nSimilarly, South Korea and Taiwan are considering plans to boost energy imports from the US to avoid Trump\u2019s ire.\n\nBalancing Act\n\nIncreased dependency on the US as a source of demand makes economies such as Vietnam more exposed should Trump decide to apply a universal tariff on all imports, by undercutting the business case to build new factories. Apart from China, economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand would be more exposed considering their high trade orientation, economists at Morgan Stanley led by Chetan Ahya wrote in a November note.\n\nSouth Korea was forced to revise down its growth outlook, partly as a result of the growing geopolitical tensions contributing to weaker demand for the country\u2019s exports. A top national security adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said the country should be prepared for the US following through on tariff threats, meeting with Trump\u2019s team during a visit to the US late last year.\n\nThen there\u2019s the blow from second-round consequences.\n\n\u201cIf Trump\u2019s tariffs lead to China\u2019s exports redirecting to the rest of Asia \u2014 and they\u2019re very competitive \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult for countries to compete,\u201d said Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia-ex Japan at Nomura Singapore Ltd. \u201cThat is something a lot of governments are thinking about.\u201d\n\nAmong those economies that are increasingly worried about unfair competition from China is the EU, which faces twin concerns of an influx of cheap Chinese goods \u2014 particularly electric vehicles \u2014 and a new wave of tariffs from the US. Officials there have already prepared a list of American goods it could target with tariffs in the event Trump follows through with his threats.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s first term, EU member states have agreed to a new set of trade powers that will allow the bloc to strike back at third countries that use economic restrictions for political retribution. The EU\u2019s new anti-coercion instrument strengthens trade defenses and enables the commission to impose tariffs or other punitive measures in response to such politically motivated restrictions.\n\nOfficials in Brazil appear less concerned of any US tariffs, believing the nation can ramp up sales to other markets including Asian countries in the case it\u2019s targeted. Indian officials are also allaying apprehensions for now, betting Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s good relations with Trump during his first presidency will continue and they have room to lower import duties for US goods as part of any forthcoming negotiations.\n\n\u201cEconomies are just stuck between a rock and a hard place in many ways,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult course to navigate to appease both US demands to decouple from China, but at the same time to remain economically engaged with China.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Ruchi Bhatia, Ditas Lopez, Francesca Stevens, Ntando Thukwana, Simone Iglesias, Maya Averbuch, Philip J.

Learn More .\n\nAs the name suggests, the FTSE 100 comprises 100 shares at any given time. Many UK investors will probably own at least a couple of them, if not all of them through a Footsie index tracker.\n\nWhen Warhammer maker Games Workshop joined the FTSE 100 just before Christmas, it became the 14th Footsie name in my 41-stock portfolio. In no particular order, here are the other 13.\n\nDividends shares\n\nOne great strength of the UK\u2019s blue-chip index is the dividend income on offer. It yields a very respectable 3.6%, but you don\u2019t have to rummage too long to unearth dividend stocks yielding far higher than the average.\n\nMy portfolio has four of these high-yielders in the shape of Legal & General, British American Tobacco, Aviva, and HSBC. Respectively, they yield 9.2%, 8.2%, 7.2%, and 6%.\n\nBeyond the income potential, I like HSBC\u2019s positioning in Asia, the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. And I want my portfolio to have long-term exposure to the UK\u2019s ageing population, which Aviva and Legal & General offer in spades. Meanwhile, British American Tobacco stock appears undervalued to me.\n\nNaturally, dividends aren\u2019t assured, and financial services stocks are exposed to the fluctuations of markets. British American Tobacco\u2019s having to manage a decline in the number of smokers worldwide while building up its non-cigarette business (vapes, pouches, heated tobacco, etc).\n\nNevertheless, I think this little basket of FTSE 100 high-yielders offers my portfolio solid dividend prospects and decent diversification.\n\nGrowthier names\n\nI also hold other dividend-paying stocks where, over time, I hope for a decent bit of share price growth on top. These include bottler Coca Cola HBC and Diageo, which yield 2.9% and 3.3% respectively.\n\nBetween them, they sell a number of timeless brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, and Guinness.\n\nI\u2019d put 2.6%-yielding defence giant BAE Systems in this bucket too. As EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in 2024: \u201cThe world is as dangerous as it has been for generations.\u201d\n\nBAE\u2019s helping European countries re-arm in an age of rising external threats. While an unpredictable Donald Trump administration adds uncertainty, I think BAE will do well moving forward.\n\nTwo turnaround stocks I hold are JD Sports Fashion and Rolls-Royce. But the former has just tanked after Christmas profits underwhelmed, so the turnaround may take a while. I\u2019ll remain patient.\n\nRounding out this category are diversified pharma giant AstraZeneca and plant hire firm Ashtead Group.\n\nInvestment trusts\n\nFinally, I hold a pair of FTSE 100 investment trusts in my portfolio. One is Pershing Square Holdings, which offers exposure to Bill Ackman\u2019s hedge fund. He has a tremendous record of beating the market.\n\nThe other is Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (LSE: SMT). The fund invests in innovative firms with high growth potential, including Amazon, Nvidia, and Instagram owner Meta Platforms.\n\nBut Scottish Mortgage also gives exposure to exciting private companies that I can\u2019t invest in myself. One is SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s extraordinary rocket company whose valuation has swelled to $350bn. Its Starlink internet service now has over 4.6m subscribers.\n\nDue to the trust\u2019s sole focus on growth companies, it can underperform badly during bear markets. But the portfolio\u2019s packed with innovators that I expect to be much larger in future, which should boost Scottish Mortgage\u2019s value over time.",

He also said China is likely to end its deflationary trend, which has lasted more than two years, as top policymakers roll out stimulus policies and crack down on industrial overcapacity. Many investors believe deflation in China is holding mainland-listed stocks back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably see 6 per cent profit growth from a pretty low base this year and that\u2019ll [give] confidence to lots of investors,\u201d Meng said. \u201cProducer prices will see an improvement and may proceed to zero or even [into] inflation. With such a backdrop, companies will have stronger pricing power, which will provide very big support for the profit margins of listed companies.\u201d\n\nDespite the benchmark CSI 300 Index\u2019s 5 per cent decline this year, UBS has joined HSBC Holdings and Goldman Sachs in saying mainland-listed stocks would post a gain for the year. That puts them at odds with many investors who are spooked by China\u2019s lingering deflation and the prospect of more tariffs from the incoming administration of president-elect Donald Trump in the US. Investor sentiment has also been hurt by a lack of clarity from Beijing on the implementation of future stimulus policies.\n\nMeng said China\u2019s pivot to looser fiscal and monetary policies, mentioned at two high-level meetings at the end of last year, would support stocks. UBS\u2019s macro team believes Beijing would raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit to the equivalent of 3 to 4 per cent of gross domestic product, while reducing borrowing costs by 30 to 40 basis points this year. The macro team said China would issue at least 2 trillion yuan (US$272.8 billion) worth of special government bonds to support growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of that, Meng said he expects the government would move to support factory-gate prices by reducing excessive capacity in some industries. China\u2019s producer prices fell 2.3 per cent in December, the 27th consecutive month of decline. Consumer inflation was flat.",

According to a report by Bloomberg, shares could be made available to the public as soon as mid-2025, with the company possibly reaching a valuation of around $2.5 billion.\n\nNo definitive decisions regarding the size and precise timeline of the IPO have been made, as deliberations continue. While Riyad Capital and JPMorgan representatives opted not to comment, these proposed moves reflect a robust IPO pipeline in Saudi Arabia. In 2024, firms raised over $4 billion in new share sales, and the projections for 2025 remain equally promising.\n\nRecently, the Saudi financial regulator authorized the IPO of another financial entity, Derayah Financial Co., in collaboration with HSBC Holdings Plc, aiming for a valuation of about $2 billion. Several other companies, including Ejada Systems Ltd. and Flynas, have lined up for public listings as well.\n\nThe Public Investment Fund (PIF), being Riyad Bank's largest shareholder, is orchestrating listings for several portfolio companies as part of its strategy to support Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's economic diversification plans. With a slew of IPOs anticipated, the Kingdom's financial landscape is bracing for transformative growth in the nearing years.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

The MSCI China Index tumbled into a bear market last week, and the CSI 300 gauge lost more than 5% in the first seven trading sessions of 2025, its worst such performance for any year since 2016.\n\nGoldman recommended investors buy government consumption proxies, emerging market exporters which will benefit from a weaker yuan, as well as select tech and infrastructure names. Meanwhile, shareholder returns \u201cshould continue to prevail on record-breaking cash distribution and falling domestic rates\u201d, they wrote.\n\nIn addition, the strategists also maintained an 'overweight' call on online retail, media and healthcare stocks, while upgrading consumer services shares to 'overweight'.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc is similarly optimistic, saying last week that it\u2019s positive on Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong given the \u201cfavorable policy rhetoric\u201d in mainland China and a better economic growth outlook.\n\nBack in November, Goldman predicted that Chinese shares could gain about 20% over the next 12 months, as authorities stepped up measures to support the struggling economy.

It will grow to $34.73 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. The projected growth during the forecast period can be attributed to several factors, including the shift towards remote work, increasing real estate prices, a rise in home renovation activities, growth in residential properties, and higher disposable income.\n\nKey trends expected in this period include technological advancements and fintech innovations, the adoption of cloud banking software by banks, improvements in the home equity borrowing process, and the use of data-driven tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate banks' decision-making processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increase in residential properties is expected to drive the growth of the home equity lending market in the future. Residential properties refer to real estate assets used for living accommodations, including single-family homes, apartments, and condominiums. The rise in residential properties can be attributed to factors such as infrastructure development, changes in zoning laws, proximity to workplaces, a growing preference for homeownership, and general inflation. Home equity lending benefits homeowners by allowing them to leverage the increased value of their property, providing funds for improvements, debt consolidation, or other financial needs, which in turn can enhance property value and overall marketability. For instance, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in March 2024, the number of private new house dwellings in Australia reached 30,992, reflecting a 3.7% increase from December and a 14.6% rise since March 2023. Additionally, private and other residential completions rose to 14,844 dwellings, a 5.6% increase compared to December 2023. Therefore, the growth in residential properties has fueled the expansion of the home equity lending market.\n\n\n\nLeading companies in the home equity lending market are focusing on adopting advanced solutions, such as real estate finance solutions utilizing eVault technology, to streamline the loan application process, enhance customer experience, and provide flexible financing options tailored to diverse borrower needs. eVault technology enhances the efficiency, security, and compliance of managing electronic loan documents, benefiting both lenders and borrowers by simplifying and securing the lending process. For example, in May 2022, Wolters Kluwer N.V., a Netherlands-based information services company, launched its OmniVault for Real Estate Finance solution. This platform ensures compliance with legal standards and offers a digitally sealed audit trail, improving the security and traceability of digital transactions. The innovative platform uses advanced eVault technology to facilitate digital home equity lending, particularly for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, along with conventional, government-backed, and jumbo first mortgages.\n\n\n\nIn September 2023, Cerberus Capital Management, a US-based investment firm, acquired Spring EQ for an undisclosed sum. This acquisition marked a strategic move by Cerberus Capital to expand its portfolio by incorporating Spring EQ's expertise in providing home equity financing solutions. Spring EQ is a US-based company specializing in home equity and purchase loans.\n\n\n\nMajor companies operating in the home equity lending market are Bank Of America Corporation, HSBC Holdings, Toronto-Dominion Bank, BMO Bank N.A., U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Inc., Discover Financial Services Inc., Citizens Financial Group Inc., M&T Bank Corporation, Regions Financial Corporation, Key Corp Limited, Rocket Mortgage LLC, Navy Federal Credit Union, HomeBridge Financial Services Inc., New American Funding Inc., Zillow Group, LoanDepot LLC, PenFed Credit Union, Simmons First National Corporation, Network Capital Funding Corporation, Spring EQ .\n\n\n\nThis report focuses on home equity lending market which is experiencing strong growth.

NFC chips are required in both devices for this technology to function. One-way communication involves a reader or powered device, such as a phone or credit card terminal, reading and writing data on the NFC chip. Two-way communication allows both devices to read and write data. Many retailers, including Target, Macy's, and Walgreens, use NFC-based contactless pay terminals for mobile payments. In 2021, over 40% of POS terminals installed globally were NFC-ready. Countries like the US, UK, China, Canada, Brazil, and India have high adoption rates for NFC-based contactless payments. The increasing demand for cashless transactions is driving the growth of the global NFC-based POS terminals market. Verifone's VX 520 countertop POS terminal is an example of an NFC-enabled device.

The PCI DSS in the US outlines security requirements for handling cardholder information. Regulations often set a limit on single contactless transactions, such as HDFC Bank's USD127 daily cap and ICICI Bank's USD254 daily limit.

That isn\u2019t how Singapore sees the utility of distributed ledgers.\n\nIt has taken a less glamorous view, which may nevertheless be more useful. The Asian financial centre has more than 1,200 asset management companies supervising S$146 billion (US$112 billion) in so-called collective investment schemes. And unlike equities, where dealing rooms in the city-state have recently had to cope with the arrival of a shorter settlement cycle in the US, the industry routinely takes a leisurely week or longer to move pension savings into mutual funds.\n\nThe Singaporean customers aren\u2019t to be blamed for this sluggishness. They put in their buy orders for funds on a mobile app on an online platform, just like they would with a stock. But that click only begins a back-and-forth of faxes and e-mails between asset managers and their distributors, fund administrators, trustees, and registrars.\n\nUnhappy with the status quo, the Monetary Authority of Singapore came up with a roadmap for transforming the island-nation\u2019s financial services industry by 2025. A specific plan was to digitalise the infrastructure. Marketnode, a joint venture of the city\u2019s stock exchange and Temasek Holdings, the investment firm behind US$288 billion of Singapore\u2019s state assets, was given the job of operating the new highway on which money and fund units can move faster.\n\nLast quarter, Fundnode, the platform, went live for cash orders, reducing their settlement time to two business days after the transaction, or T+2 in industry parlance. Before the end of the year, the savings parked with Singapore\u2019s state-run and privately operated pension programmes will also be able to move in and out of mutual funds with equal ease.\n\nThe experimentation with efficiency comes at a delicate time for Singapore\u2019s reputation as a financial centre. A record S$3 billion money-laundering scandal in which a group of criminals from China laundered proceeds from online gambling through at least 16 financial institutions has made both banks and authorities extra cautious about illicit flows.\n\nBT in your inbox Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nThe city\u2019s stance towards cryptocurrencies has also tightened, especially when it comes to protecting the local retail investor. When Singapore hosts its Formula One night race on Sep 22, there will be no crypto advertising along the track. It was banned two years ago, shortly before the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX empire.\n\nBut blockchains, especially those that are restricted to a small group of participants, can do much more than mint tokens for speculation. A big part of the effort in crunching fund settlements has been spent on replacing manual processes with smart contracts, or self-executing computer code. That has, in turn, required bringing scattered, unstructured data into a unified repository, the ledger everyone can track \u201cas a single source of truth\u201d, says Rehan Ahmed, Marketnode\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nIt\u2019s painstaking work, but with enormous potential. Sure, Singapore has 0.6 per cent of the world\u2019s millionaires. Still, the savings of six million people are a drop in the bucket of wealth that comes to it from the global rich. Overall, asset managers in the financial centre manage S$5.4 trillion, of which 77 per cent is sourced from outside, and 89 per cent is invested overseas. If the city-state can demonstrate a role for distributed ledgers in mutual funds, it can pitch the new platform to the wider asset management industry.\n\nEven that will be just the tip of the iceberg. As Ahmed explains, large private banks issue about 500 structured products in a day to their clients. Squeeze the 10-to-15-day settlement period, and high-net-worth individuals might be able to execute bespoke bets over shorter timeframes. An experiment under the Singapore monetary authority\u2019s Project Guardian, where HSBC Holdings acted as the issuer of structured products on Marketnode\u2019s platform, has resulted in a second product for the Singapore company. HSBC led the start-up\u2019s Series A financing round in May.\n\nHong Kong and Singapore, the two Asian financial hubs, are charting their independent pathways. Hong Kong is likely to put e-HKD, a paperless version of its cash, in the hands of individuals, while Singapore has decided to sit out the global craze for retail central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. It is, however, ahead in harnessing blockchain technology in the nuts and bolts of institutional finance. Temasek has cofounded another financial infrastructure startup, Partior. Its goal is to create a unified ledger that will cut counterparty risk from foreign-exchange trading.\n\nThere are also overlaps between the traditional rivals. Hong Kong wants to explore digital representations of everything from green bonds to electric-vehicle charging stations. Singapore isn\u2019t far behind. Last year, it began five new pilots to take advantage of what Citigroup calls the \u201ckiller use case\u201d of blockchain technology: a US$4 trillion market for tokenisation of financial and real-world assets by 2030.\n\nThe exotic part of the business will still be the wildly gyrating cryptocurrencies, or their calmer but still controversial cousins: stablecoins. In the engine room of finance, though, it\u2019s not the coins but the technology behind them that\u2019s coming into its own. Distributed ledgers and smart contracts are demonstrating their usefulness, even to those asset owners and intermediaries who don\u2019t want to be anywhere near Bitcoin. BLOOMBERG",

Bloomberg clarified that nothing is final, but the e-wallet is starting to make considerations.\n\nChina Bank Capital Corp. managing director Juan Paolo Colet said GCash might still be interested in listing here in the Philippines.\n\nHowever, Colet believes that the decision to hire overseas banks as partners means that GCash is eyeing foreign investors when it goes public.\n\n\u201cThe selection of foreign banks is not indicative of the listing venue, (but) what it tells us is that the IPO will be marketed primarily to foreign investors,\u201d Colet told The STAR.\n\nFurther, Colet sees GCash becoming more confident in its plan to go public, and predicts that the e-wallet will do the listing this year even as the market is muddled with risks.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Philippine IPO environment looks challenging, there appears to be strong appetite for a financial technology platform like GCash, so there is an opportunity for the company to do its IPO this year,\u201d Colet said.\n\nRegina Capital Development Corp. head of sales Luis Limlingan also thinks that GCash could be on its way to an IPO in 2025.\n\nLimlingan said the e-wallet might have tapped the said banks because they give the most confidence for what could become the biggest IPO in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cFor me, if there is a sizable number of investors and they get their desired price, GCash will list. Probably, the underwriters are still doing some bookbuilding,\u201d Limlingan told The STAR.\n\nLimlingan recalled that GCash has hinted at going public since 2021, and yet the e-wallet has yet to come up with a definite timeline on when it will actually do so.\n\nMoreover, he said GCash\u2019s owner Globe Telecom Inc. would experience fluctuations in its share prices as long as the e-wallet is unclear on its IPO schedule.\n\nIn 2024 GCash\u2019s parent Globe Fintech Innovations Inc. (Mynt) bolstered the e-wallet\u2019s valuation by picking up a new financier in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the largest banking network in Japan.\n\nThe entry of fresh investments raised GCash\u2019s worth to $5 billion, more than doubled its previous valuation of $2 billion. Earlier, Bloomberg has reported that GCash may be eyeing to generate as much as $1.5 billion in its IPO.",

Yet long periods of underperformance mean that many top blue-chips are still trading at dirt cheap prices.\n\nHere are two of my favourite FTSE 100 value shares today. Not only do they trade on rock-bottom price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, they also carry tremendous market-beating dividend yields.\n\nFTSE 100 share P/E ratio Dividend yield HSBC (LSE:HSBA) 7.7 times 6.5% Rio Tinto (LSE:RIO) 8.5 times 6.6%\n\nLet me explain why I think they\u2019re worth serious consideration.\n\nTop bank\n\nAsia-focused HSBC\u2019s tipped to endure a slight earnings drop in 2025. This reflects in part the ongoing threat posed by China\u2019s weak economy, and more specifically its slumping property sector.\n\nBut encouragingly, the bank\u2019s so far managed to effectively navigate the tough trading environment. In the third quarter of 2024, it beat broker forecasts to post revenues and profits growth of 5% and 10% respectively.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bet against HSBC beating full-year estimates for this year either, helped by ongoing efforts to accelerate cost cutting. According to Bloomberg, the bank\u2019s targeting \u00a33bn of savings through restructuring efforts that it aims to complete by June.\n\nI think HSBC shares could deliver great long-term returns as financial product demand surges across its emerging markets. It has the scale and the brand power to supercharge its earnings growth, and plans to split its operations between \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019 should help meet its goals.\n\nGreat miner\n\nRio Tinto\u2019s another Footsie share expected to post a slight earnings dip in 2025. This also reflects problems in China\u2019s commodities-hungry economy, allied with a broader slowdown of global growth.\n\nYet I believe it\u2019s a value stock for patient investors to consider. I hold it in my own Stocks and Shares ISA and plan to increase my holdings when I next have spare cash to invest.\n\nOver a longer time horizon, the outlook for major mining stocks like this remains compelling. Rio Tinto \u2014 which has a market-cap of \u00a359bn \u2014 has the strength to weather temporary weakness in metal prices.\n\nExpertise across a range of commodities including copper, iron ore and lithium means it\u2019s well-positioned to capitalise on demand growth when the market upturn eventually comes. Factors like global decarbonisation, emerging market urbanisation and the growing digital economy should all lift industrial metals consumption substantially from current levels.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a strong balance sheet gives Rio room to boost earnings growth through acquisitions and organic investment. Latest financials showed its net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio at just 0.4 times.",

            "content": "Friday, January 10, 2025\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (HOV) and Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. (PPIH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past six months (+6.6% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\n\n\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds is a concern for investors.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Alphabet have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+38.6% vs. +33%). The company is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex, generative AI solutions and core Google Cloud Platform products.\n\n\n\nGOOGL\u2019s strong AI portfolio is helping it attract new customers, win larger deals, and deepen product adoption among existing customers. Alphabet\u2019s expanding GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver.\n\n\n\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance search results continue to boost traffic on Google\u2019s search engine. GOOGL outperformed its industry in the trailing 12 months. However, increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\n\n\n\nCisco shares have narrowly outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past year (+21% vs. +20.2%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Its Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\n\n\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\n\n\n\nHowever, the company has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Hovnanian have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the past year (-27.6% vs. -4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $749 million is facing profitability issues due to declining margins and heavy reliance on incentives to drive affordability. Elevated land investments and regional concentration increase vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\n\n\nReliance on incentives heightens financial risks, while competition and external disruptions threaten growth and market position. Nevertheless, Hovnanian has demonstrated strong revenue growth and operational efficiency, capitalizing on resilient housing demand and effective sales strategies.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on expanding its community footprint and quick move-in homes positions it for sustained growth. Strategic land investments boost growth, while cost discipline sustains profitability. With a commitment to aligning growth initiatives with market trends, Hovnanian is well-positioned to deliver strong returns and shareholder value.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Hovnanian here >>>)\n\n\n\nPerma-Pipe International\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Steel - Pipe and Tube industry over the past year (+49.3% vs. +26.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $106.85 million has a backlog which grew 33% to over $100 million by November, reflecting strong demand in key markets like oil and gas and district energy. Geographic diversification, including $61 million in recent contracts across MENA and the Americas, reduces regional risks while positioning the company for growth in energy and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIts focus on high-growth markets aligns with robust infrastructure development, supported by proprietary technologies like the XTRU-THERM insulation system, bolstering market leadership. The company\u2019s tailored solutions cater to high-margin sectors, ensuring operational resilience.\n\n\n\nLong-term demand is underpinned by global steel pipe market growth, fueled by investments in infrastructure and urbanization. However, exposure to cyclical markets, intense competition, geopolitical risks and regulatory compliance costs present challenges.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Perma-Pipe International here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), The Charles Schwab Corp.

They raised their year-end estimate for the index to 8,800 from the previous forecast of 8,610.\n\nThe strategists also raised Hong Kong to 'overweight' from 'neutral', while downgrading India to 'neutral'. South Korean stocks were raised to 'neutral' from 'underweight'.\n\nTheir rating changes come as Chinese stocks are off to a weak start this year, amid concerns over rising geopolitical tensions stemming from Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and his vows to raise tariffs. The broader MSCI China Index is down 19% from an October peak, approaching a bear market.\n\nStill, lower interest rates, along with initiatives to boost tourism and revive the ailing local property sector, will support Hong Kong\u2019s stock market, HSBC strategists said.\n\n\u201cThe prospects for mainland China\u2019s economy have improved, and the recent shift in policy tone affirms the government\u2019s determination to stabilise the economy,\u201d they said. \u201cThis bodes well for the A-share market, and we think the Hong Kong market will be an extended beneficiary.\u201d\n\nWhile there are expectations for further stimulus, concerns remain over the strength of the country\u2019s economic recovery, with some market watchers sounding the alarm on a deflationary spiral similar to what Japan experienced in the 1990s.\n\nInvestors are now looking to the National People\u2019s Congress meeting in March for Beijing\u2019s 2025 growth target and detailed plans to boost consumption.\n\nIn January last year, HSBC forecast gains of about 24% for the HSCEI gauge in 2024. The index ended the year with a 26% advance.\n\n\u201cRecent policy initiatives suggest that the risk of an immediate drop in earnings growth has been averted,\u201d the strategists wrote in their current note. \u201cThis is critical for mitigating tail risks and restoring market confidence at a time when households are sitting on over US$20 trillion (RM90.13 trillion) of cash savings.\u201d\n\nHSBC\u2019s upbeat view stands in contrast with some of its peers such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which downgraded Hong Kong stocks to 'underweight' in November due to the weak property and retail sectors. Morgan Stanley is also bearish on Chinese shares given deflationary pressures and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nMeanwhile, HSBC also lowered its recommendation on India to 'neutral' from 'overweight', citing a domestic slowdown and elevated valuations that may limit returns this year.\n\nThe rally in the Nifty 50 Index has lost steam in recent months due to softer corporate earnings and a retreat of foreign funds. The Indian government this week lowered its economic growth projection for the fiscal year to the weakest since the pandemic.\n\nSouth Korean stocks were upgraded by HSBC to 'neutral' from 'underweight' as the recent sell-off provides a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d to raise exposure. The political change in the nation should have little impact on earnings, the HSBC strategists said.",

First-financing dollars more than doubled in 2024, but deals were down as $100M + mega-rounds accounted for 72% of all first-financing dollars. Many of these deals were venture-created, with an increasing focus on big exits with blank checks and deals in-licensing China assets. Most of the mega-rounds in 2024 were joined by crossover investors at cycle-high valuations, setting the stage for large M&A or an active public market for IPOs. For the year ahead, overall investment is expected to continue with strong support from VC, crossover, and growth investors, hitting $24 -26B .\n\nMedical Devices\n\nWhile there was a surge in first-financing deals and dollars in 2Q 2024, overall first-financing investment was down for the year, marked by early investor fear of finding a new Series B lead and a longer time to exit in private M&A, as Series A insider-round extensions spiked. Notably, the top 10% of all medical device deals attracted 60% of dollars, with an influx of large financings for both commercial scale-up and pivotal trials. Neurology, NIM, and Orthopedic indications led overall investments. 2025 may bring a first-financing comeback in dollars (larger rounds instead of more deals) and greater overall investment driven by pivotal trial funding and large commercial rounds.\n\nHealthtech\n\nEarly-stage investment in AI (artificial intelligence) applications continued to gain momentum, particularly within the clinical workflow subsector, although investments overall were down compared to 2023. Overall, Healthtech investment dollars grew from 2023 and have normalized to pre-2023 banking crisis levels, with continued investment in companies targeting underserved groups and in specialized care. Investment dollars dipped in 4Q 2024 relative to earlier quarters, partially driven by investors waiting to see what happens with potential IPOs in 2025, as high-growth companies have been waiting in the wings. The market may continue to normalize in 2025 for early to mid-stage companies amid further proliferation of AI solutions, particularly in clinical applications. All eyes are on IPOs as the market tracks early IPO performance and digests the new deregulatory policy positions in healthcare.\n\nDX/Tools\n\nOverall investment was up but top-heavy as the top 10% of deals secured 48% of all dollars. Most of the larger deals were commercial-stage revenue-ramping companies, with the top deals at significant revenues and commanding large valuations. Facing financing risk and a tough exit environment, the first-financing slowdown persisted, hitting a four-year low in 2024. Corporate investment did increase in first-financing as traditional VCs retreated, with the largest funded deals focusing on themes such as radiopharma, computational bio, and oncology-focused liquid biopsy. In 2025, first-financing is likely to remain stable, while AI-enabled deals might see a spike.\n\nThe HSBC Venture Healthcare Report was written and produced by HSBC Innovation Banking\u2019s Life Science and Healthcare Team, which serves the innovation economy by providing products and solutions to early and growth-stage companies.\n\n\u201cEven while investors are looking to decrease risk, the continued inflows to emerging sectors like AI are an encouraging sign for the year ahead,\u201d said Katherine Andersen, Head of Life Science and Healthcare, HSBC Innovation Banking, U.S. \u201cThis report builds on previous insights to assess the past year of investment activity and create data-driven predictions for the year ahead, underpinned by our team\u2019s dedicated experts.

            "content": "The government is pushing banks to lend more to small businesses but lending has slumped amid high interest rates and a property downturn. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n- Hong Kong banks are hoarding cash and liquidity despite calls by the government to help out struggling small businesses with funding to reignite the city\u2019s ailing economy.\n\nBanks in the city, including HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered, held an aggregate liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of more than 180 per cent in the second quarter, the highest ever and almost double the 100 per cent requirement.\n\nThe ratio \u2013 which gauges liquid assets held to meet short-term obligations \u2013 eased slightly to 178.4 per cent in September, according to the latest data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\n\nThe cash hoard has raised concerns with regulators, as the economy struggles to regain traction after the Covid-19 pandemic years and political upheaval.\n\nThe government, along with local banks, in August set up a task force to unleash small business funding and said it would \u201cmonitor\u201d the business strategies of lenders. On their end, banks say the cash positions are prudent given the sluggish economy and property downturn and that demand for loans is subdued after years of rising interest rates.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s currency is pegged to the US dollar, and its monetary policy follows the US central bank, which until 2024 had been raising rates.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are struggling a lot, a lot are struggling to get finance,\u201d said Mr Benjamin Quinlan, the chief executive of consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. \u201cThe economic profile of Hong Kong is not great. SMEs are critical to this city. Lending levels have been stagnant for the past five to six years.\u201d\n\nThe 16 participating banks have set aside about HK$370 billion (S$65 billion) in funds dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), according to a spokesperson for the regulator.\n\nIn each of the first three quarters of 2024 , banks provided less than HK$300 billion in loans to the city\u2019s wholesale and retail companies \u2013 a loose proxy for SMEs. That is down from as much as HK$500 billion a quarter in 2014.\n\nHang Seng Bank, which is controlled by HSBC, has the highest LCR by far among major lenders, clocking in above 300 per cent. The lender has been hit hard by the city\u2019s real estate slump, with impaired commercial real estate loans surging 12-fold in the first half of 2024 , according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIt is \u201cmore costly\u201d for banks to underwrite loans to SMEs and the risks of lending outweigh the returns, according to Mr Francis Chan, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nOther lenders with high ratios include Bank of East Asia at 247 per cent as at September 2024 and Bank of China (Hong Kong) at 231.8 per cent.\n\nA Bank of East Asia spokesman said the lender has been supportive of SMEs as it consistently keeps its LCR above regulatory requirements.\n\nHSBC does not publicly disclose the figure for its Hong Kong unit. A bank spokesman said historically, its liquidity metrics have been \u201cwell above\u201d the regulatory minimum, and the bank\u2019s strong position enables it to continue to support customers.\n\nStanChart is dedicated to meeting clients\u2019 financing needs, while its LCR reflects a prudent approach to liquidity management, according to a spokeswoman. Hong Kong remained its largest financing market, and loans and advances to customers in the city showed mild year-on-year growth during the third quarter of 2024, she said.\n\nProperty downturn\n\nThe excess liquidity is also due to the property downturn in China and Hong Kong commercial real estate. Many banks have \u201ctrimmed down\u201d their exposure to both, which were a \u201ckey part\u201d of their corporate lending, according to Mr Chan.\n\nHSBC, the biggest lender in the city, cut total China real estate exposure to US$9.4 billion (S$12.8 billion) as at the second quarter of 2024, down from US$21.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSome of that exposure was booked in Hong Kong. It also posted US$100 million of loan loss provisions for Hong Kong commercial real estate during the third quarter.\n\nIts subsidiary Hang Seng Bank saw its credit-impaired gross loans and advances to Hong Kong commercial real estate customers jump to HK$13.5 billion in the first half of 2024, from HK$1.1 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nRival StanChart reduced its exposure to China commercial real estate to US$2 billion as at September 2024, down by over 50 per cent since the end of 2021. Its commercial real estate risks are limited, a spokesperson said.\n\nLoans and advances to customers made up around 35 per cent of banks\u2019 overall assets in November, down from around 41 per cent in Nov 2021, representing a drop of about HK$1.11 trillion, according to HKMA data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a macro story that loan growth has been rather weak,\u201d said Mr Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, adding that there has been a \u201csharp decline\u201d in loans in Hong Kong in the last three years, with the real estate downturn and people borrowing less for mortgages while companies are less optimistic.

Meanwhile, 30-year gilt yields have soared to their highest point in over a quarter-century.\n\nIn today\u2019s auction, the DMO sold five-year gilts at an average yield of 4.49%, which is the return the Treasury offers to investors purchasing its debt.\n\nEconomists have cautioned that Chancellor Reeves is on the verge of breaching her fiscal rules and may be forced to implement another tax increase as bond yields continue to rise.\n\nCapital Economics highlighted that the rise in borrowing costs has depleted \u00a38.9 billion of the Chancellor\u2019s \u00a39.9 billion buffer, jeopardizing her ability to maintain a balanced budget by 2029/30 as mandated by her fiscal rules.\n\nEconomists Ruth Gregory and Alex Kerr commented, \u201cThere is a significant chance that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will determine that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on track to miss her primary fiscal rule when it updates its forecasts on March 26.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone reads this article found it useful, helpful?

Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nAMD data by YCharts.\n\nWith December's trading concluded, AMD stock closed out 2024 down roughly 18%. The chip specialist's share price fell in the final month of 2024 as analysts became more cautious about the stock and issued downward share-price and revenue-outlook targets.\n\nAnalysts became less bullish on AMD stock last month\n\nOn Dec. 9, Bank of America published coverage of AMD, downgrading the stock's rating from buy to neutral. The bank also lowered its one-year price target on the stock from $180 per share to $155 per share. Then, Truist published a note lowering its price target on Dec. 16. The investment company cuts its one-year price forecast from $180 per share to $155 per share and maintained a hold rating on the stock.\n\nThe next day, Wolfe Research published a a new report on the company and stated it expected AMD's 2025 revenue to come in roughly $3 billion below the average Wall Street estimate. According to Wolfe, AMD's progress in artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be weaker than anticipated.\n\nAs a result, the investment firm expects the company will only record $7 billion in AI revenue this year. With these dynamics in mind, Wolfe's analysts see the company having trouble heading into its anticipated quarterly report this month.\n\nFinally, Morgan Stanley published a note maintaining an equal-weight rating on the stock on Dec. 20. The investment company lowered its one-year price target on the stock from $169 per share to $158 per share, citing the potential for tough competition from Nvidia to limit the company's growth opportunities in the AI space.\n\nWhat's up with AMD stock in 2025?\n\nAfter a month of double-digit sell-offs, AMD stock started the new year with some rebound trading momentum. The company's share price had been up roughly 4% heading into the start of trading on Jan. 8, but fresh bearish coverage and investor consideration of macroeconomic risk factors have wiped out those gains. The chip-specialist's stock is now roughly flat in 2025's trading.\n\nBefore the market opened this morning, HSBC published new coverage on AMD and issued a rare double downgrade for its rating on the stock. The bank lowered its rating from buy to reduce and cut its one-year price target from $200 per share to $110 per share. HSBC's analysts cited AMD's lack of competitive strength against Nvidia as a key reason for the ratings downgrade and price cut.\n\nAMD is heading into 2025 with lowered expectations. Nvidia has continued to dominate the market for advanced processors for data centers, and some analysts are worried that AI won't become the powerful near-term catalyst for the business that had previously been expected. On the other hand, it's far too early to write off AMD -- and it's possible that recent pressures for the stock will help set the stage for an explosive comeback rally.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 891% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 172% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 6, 2025\n\nHSBC Holdings is an advertising partner of Motley Fool Money.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong banks are hoarding cash and liquidity despite calls by the government to help out struggling small businesses with funding to reignite the city\u2019s ailing economy.\n\nBanks in the city, including HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc, held an aggregate liquidity coverage ratio of more than 180% in the second quarter, the highest ever and almost double the 100% requirement. The ratio \u2014 which gages liquid assets held to meet short-term obligations \u2014 eased slightly to 178.4% in September, according to the latest data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe cash hoard has raised concern with regulators as the economy struggles to regain traction after the pandemic years and political upheaval. The government, along with local banks, in August set up a task force to unleash small business funding and said it would \u201cmonitor\u201d the business strategies of lenders.\n\nOn their end, banks say the cash positions are prudent given the sluggish economy and property downturn and that demand for loans is subdued after years of rising interest rates. Hong Kong\u2019s currency is pegged to the US dollar, and its monetary policy follows the US central bank, which until last year had been raising rates.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are struggling a lot, a lot are struggling to get finance,\u201d said Benjamin Quinlan, the chief executive officer of consulting firm Quinlan & Associates. \u201cThe economic profile of Hong Kong is not great. SMEs are critical to this city. Lending levels have been stagnant for the past five to six years.\u201d\n\nThe 16 participating banks have set aside about HK$370 billion ($48 billion) in funds dedicated to small and medium enterprises, according to a spokesperson for the regulator.\n\nIn each of the first three quarters of last year, banks provided less than HK$300 billion in loans to the city\u2019s whole sale and retail firms - a loose proxy for SMEs. That\u2019s down from as much as HK$500 billion a quarter in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe HKMA has been encouraging banks to strive to support the real economy including SMEs under the overarching principle of prudent risk management,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHang Seng Bank Ltd., which is controlled by HSBC, has the highest LCR by far among major lenders, clocking in above 300%. The lender has been hit hard by the city\u2019s real estate slump, with impaired commercial real estate loans surging 12-fold in the first half of last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nA spokeswoman for the lender said she was unable to comment.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cmore costly\u201d for banks to underwrite loans to small- and medium-enterprises and the risks of lending outweighs the returns, according to Francis Chan, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nOther lenders with high ratios included Bank of East Asia at 247% as of Sept. 2024 and Bank of China (Hong Kong) at 231.8%.\n\nA Bank of East Asia Ltd. spokesman said the lender has been supportive of small and medium enterprises as it consistently keeps its LCR above regulatory requirements.\n\nHSBC doesn\u2019t publicly disclose the figure for its Hong Kong unit. A bank spokesman said historically, its liquidity metrics have been \u201cwell above\u201d the regulatory minimum and the bank\u2019s strong position enables it to continue to support customers.\n\nStandard Chartered is dedicated to meeting clients financing needs, while its LCR reflects a prudent approach in liquidity management, according to a spokeswoman. Hong Kong remained its largest financing market and loans and advances to customers in the city showed mild year-on-year growth during the third quarter of 2024, she said.\n\nReal Estate\n\nThe excess liquidity is also due to the property downturn in China and Hong Kong commercial real estate. Many banks have \u201ctrimmed down\u201d their exposure to both, which were a \u201ckey part\u201d of their corporate lending, according to BI\u2019s Chan.\n\nHSBC, the biggest lender in the city, cut total mainland China real estate exposure to $9.4 billion as of second quarter 2024, down from $21.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2021. Some of that exposure was booked in Hong Kong. It also posted $100 million of loan loss provisions for Hong Kong commercial real estate during the third quarter.\n\nIts subsidiary Hang Seng Bank saw its credit impaired gross loans and advances to Hong Kong commercial real estate customers jump to HK$13.5 billion in first half of 2024, from HK$1.1 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nRival Standard Chartered Plc reduced its exposure to China commercial real estate to $2 billion as of Sept. 2024, down by over 50% since end 2021. Its commercial real estate risks are limited, the spokeswoman said.\n\nLoans and advances to customers made up around 35% of banks\u2019 overall assets in November, down from around 41% in Nov. 2021, representing a drop of about HK$1.11 trillion ($140 billion), according to HKMA data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a macro story that loan growth has been rather weak,\u201d said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA, adding that there has been a \u201csharp decline\u201d in loans in Hong Kong in the last three years, with a real estate downturn and people borrowing less for mortgages while companies are less optimistic.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Loan volumes in Asia Pacific excluding Japan fell 4.6% to $590 billion, the lowest annual tally since 2020, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The trend is expected to reverse, driven by a pick up in merger and acquisition activity and a favorable interest rate environment.\n\nBank Mandiri is paying a margin of 65 basis basis points over the risk-free benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the people said, adding that the transaction has been sent to a limited number of banks as the pricing is relatively thin.\n\nLast year, state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia\u2019s closed a $1 billion syndicated loan, offering its lowest-ever margin for a three-year tenor at 70 basis points above SOFR. While BRI\u2019s deal was thought to have been paying too low a return, 19 banks ended up funding the facility.\n\nBank Mandiri is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s Ratings and BBB by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings, on par with the sovereign.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

The Morningstar Europe NR index declined by a small 0.4%, but with differences between markets: Italy and France advanced by 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, while the UK market lost 2.1%. By country, Denmark was the hardest hit, losing a significant 11.1%.\n\nThe share price of Novo Nordisk NOVO B, which fell 17.6% in December after disappointing anti-obesity drug data, is the cause for the decline.\n\nThe slump in the Danish pharmaceutical giant, which is the European stock with the biggest market capitalization, was largely responsible for the Large Growth style losing 1.0% in December, compared with a rise of 0.9% for the Large Value style. It also explains why the healthcare sector was one of the worst sectors, down 3.7%.\n\nAnother large-cap growth company that had a very negative December was Spain\u2019s Inditex ITX, which lost 4.9%.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news in December for the growth segment. Technology companies SAP SE SAP and ASML Holding ASML managed to regain 5.1% and 3.1%, respectively, but one of the biggest risers within growth companies was French luxury company Hermes International SA RMS which gained a significant 12.5% last month.\n\nGerman Carmakers Recovered in December\n\nOn the Large Value side, December was the month of recovery for German automakers. BMW BMW and Volkswagen VOW were up 12.8% and 10.3%, respectively. It was also a good month for some of the big European banks such as HSBC Holdings HSBA, while Italian entities Intesa Sanpaolo ISP and UniCredit UCG each gained 6.5% and 5.9%, respectively.\n\nWithin this segment of the European market, some companies posted notable losses such as the two large London-listed basic materials companies, Rio Tinto RIO and Glencore GLEN, which gave up 3.8% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\nA Positive Year for Growth Stocks\n\n2024 highlights the large difference in performance between European value and growth companies. The Large Growth style, for example, gained 26.8% compared to a 12.0% rise for the Large Value style.\n\nThe only segment of our European Style Box to finish negative was Small Value, which ended the year down 0.8%.\n\nCyclical Consumption on the Rise and Real Estate on the Fall\n\nAt the sector level, the consumer cyclical sector, dominated by automakers and luxury companies, stood out in December with a 4.5% gain, followed by the technology sector, which posted a 4% gain.\n\nHowever, if we look at the returns for the year as a whole, it was the financial sector that appreciated the most with a rise of 30.0%.\n\nOn the opposite side, not only did the healthcare sector perform poorly in December (due to Novo Nordisk), with a fall of 3.7%, but the real estate sector declined also, losing 4.7% over the same period. This sector was one of the two that ended the year in negative territory (-0.6%). The other was the energy sector, which lost 1.2%.\n\nLarge Value Remains Undervalued, While Technology is Overvalued\n\nIn terms of valuations, the Large Value segment ended the year with a Price/Fair Value of 0.84, which means it is undervalued by 16%. In contrast, the Large Growth segment trades at a premium of 13%.\n\nBy sector, the only European sector to show an overvaluation is the technology sector, which trades at a 6% premium. At the end of December, the cheapest sectors were the communications sector (Price/Fair Value of 0.79) and real estate (Price/Fair Value of 0.80).\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

And while the corporate earnings calendar still remains quiet, things have picked up for economic data.\n\nWeak data from China did little to dampen mining stocks early on, despite the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index unexpectedly declining to 50.5 from a five-month high 51.5 in November (consensus: 51.7). The survey showed that new order growth eased on the back of \"softening external demand\".\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said it was \"somewhat perplexing\" to see mining stocks perform well on Thursday. \"China is a significant player in the global commodities market and negative economic data typically casts a dark cloud over the mining sector for fear that metals demand will weaken. The jump in mining shares [...] will have been influenced by a weaker pound against the US dollar,\" he said.\n\nIn the UK, the S&P Global manufacturing PMI for December was revised down to an 11-month low of 47.0, down from 48.0 in November and below the initial estimate of 47.3 released two weeks ago.\n\nThe S&P Global/HCOB eurozone manufacturing PMI for December was also revised down to 45.1 from 45.2, marking the 30th straight reading below 50.\n\nIn other news, Nationwide reported that UK house prices rose 4.7% year-on-year in December to \u00a3269,426, up 0.7% over the month to sit just below an all-time high recorded in summer 2022. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that the housing market \"ended 2024 on a strong footing\", but volatility is expected across the next few months due to upcoming changes to stamp duty, which will \"make it more difficult to discern the underlying strength of the market\".\n\nProducers track commodities higher\n\nFresnillo, Glencore, BP and Shell were among the best performers of the day as commodity prices rose.

Asia\u0092s largest retailer Fast Retailing is forecasting a record profit for the year ending August 2023, thanks to improving demand for its cheap casual apparel in Japan and a weaker yen bolstering profits brought back home from overseas. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co. and Seven & i Holdings are among the first to kick off this earnings season in Asia.\n\nFast Retailing\u2019s November-ending quarter may have seen operating profit growth soften as warmer autumn-winter temperatures dented sales, even with the backdrop for consumer spending in Japan looking promising.\n\nSeven & i, operator of the 7-Eleven chain, may disappoint investors with operating profit declining for the third consecutive quarter. That\u2019s despite a growth in customer traffic due to domestic campaigns, and a recovery in in-store same store sales internationally, according to Macquarie analysts.\n\nThe founding family of the Japanese convenience store giant is seeking to fend off a takeover bid from Canada\u2019s Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. Seven & i unveiled a plan to jettison its underperforming businesses in October to focus on its convenience store operations.\n\nIn South Korea, Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s operating profit is projected to recover thanks to the chip segment, where profit has probably tripled on robust demand in high-bandwidth memory used in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nIndian software services bellwether Tata Consultancy Services likely saw profit growth accelerating to a six-quarter high. Commentary on 2025 budgets will be closely watched as some analysts believe US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promised corporate tax cuts should allow for more tech spending, at odds with another view that \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies will discourage outsourcing projects.\n\nHighlights to look out for:\n\nWednesday: Samsung\u2019s (005930 KS) fourth-quarter operating profit likely rose on the back of AI-related demand for memory chips. In line with Micron\u2019s disclosures, Samsung\u2019s average selling prices for DRAM may have slightly improved, while that for NAND may have faced erosion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The Korean won\u2019s depreciation could be a tailwind for component sales, buffering margin deterioration, but upside may be limited for smartphones and TVs due to rising component costs, HSBC said.\n\nThursday: Seven & i (3382 JP) may report a double-digit decline in third-quarter operating profit, as growth in superstore operations was offset by profit slipping across the rest of its segments, consensus show.\n\nFast Retailing (9983 JP) is projected to show operating profit growth slowed as higher temperatures eroded sales of winter clothing in October. Higher store rents may limit margin expansion through 2025, analysts at BI wrote in a report. Prospects in mainland China, which accounts for nearly 20% of revenue, have also weakened after Chief Executive Officer Tadashi Yanai reiterated in November that the company doesn\u2019t source cotton from Xinjiang, spurring calls for boycott of Uniqlo products on Chinese social media.\n\nTata Consultancy Services (TCS IN) may see profit growth accelerating to a six-quarter high. TCS has been hiring more over the last two quarters in anticipation of a comeback in tech spending from its overseas clients. Depreciation in the Indian rupee may translate to higher revenue.\n\nFriday: Yaskawa\u2019s (6506 JP) third-quarter operating income likely turned positive for the first time in six quarters thanks to a recovery in the robotics business. Orders are set to grow 10%, Macquarie said. Analysts are keen on Yaskawa steadily shifting resources to the Americas for market share expansion, countering slow demand recovery in its main market China, according to SMBC Nikko.\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nASX-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a great tool for Aussies to utilise for international diversification beyond ASX shares. Another benefit is the income that ETFs can provide.\n\nSome of the ASX's biggest companies are known as ASX dividend shares, including BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), and ANZ Group Holdings Ltd (ASX: ANZ).\n\nHowever, a strong rally of ASX bank shares in 2024 has lowered the overall dividend yield. At the end of November 2024, the dividend yield of the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (ASX: VAS) \u2014 a fund that tracks the S&P/ASX 300 Index (ASX: XKO) \u2014 was 3.4%.\n\nThere are other share markets out there that can also be good income options. Let's look at two geographic-based ASX ETFs that offer comparable and pleasing dividend income.\n\nBetashares FTSE 100 ETF (ASX: F100)\n\nThe purpose of this ASX ETF is to provide exposure to a portfolio of 100 blue-chip companies on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nI'd describe a good number of these businesses as global companies, such as Astrazeneca, Shell, HSBC, Unilever, Relx, BP, British American Tobacco and Diageo. While they are listed in London, they generate earnings from across the world.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the F100 ETF is that it trades on a pleasingly low price/earnings (P/E) ratio, enabling a good dividend yield. According to BetaShares, the F100 ETF had a forward P/E ratio of 11.5x at the end of November 2024, compared to 21.8x for the VAS ETF.\n\nAccording to BetaShares, the 12-month distribution yield from the F100 ETF was 3.5% at the end of November 2024.\n\nBetashares India Quality ETF (ASX: IIND)\n\nI believe getting exposure to the Indian economy could be a smart move for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Australian Treasury projects that the Indian economy will see an average annual growth rate of 6% over the next two decades thanks to improving productivity.\n\nNot every Indian business is going to be high-quality, just like on the ASX or any other share market. So, this fund is focused on owning just the high-quality Indian companies.\n\nCompanies must rank well on three factors to make it into the portfolio: high profitability, low leverage, and high earnings stability. When you put those factors together, it's not surprising to me that the IIND ETF has returned an average of 10.1% per year since August 2019 \u2013 a solid return.\n\nAccording to BetaShares, this fund's forward P/E ratio was 24x as of 29 November 2024, reflecting the expected growth potential of holdings like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Hindustan Unilever.\n\nDespite the higher earnings valuation, this ASX ETF still offered a 12-month distribution yield of 3.4% at 29 November 2024.",

            "content": "New Delhi, Jan. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global Trade finance market is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 21,181.13 billion by 2033 from US$ 10,880.50 million in 2024 at a CAGR of 7.83% during the forecast period 2025\u20132033.\n\nTrade finance is the engine behind global trade, ensuring the seamless flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. In 2024, its importance has only grown as businesses increasingly rely on innovative financial instruments to mitigate risks and unlock new opportunities in global markets. It is estimated that the majority of global merchandise exports, particularly in emerging markets, are supported by some form of trade finance. This highlights how integral these mechanisms are for both SMEs and multinational corporations (MNCs). By bridging the gap between buyers and sellers, trade finance not only facilitates payments but also ensures trust in complex cross-border transactions.\n\nDownload Sample Copy @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/trade-finance-market\n\nHowever, the trade finance market remains a paradox of progress and challenges. While digital tools such as blockchain and AI-based compliance systems have significantly expedited transaction times, around 60% of global trade documentation is still paper-based. This inefficiency persists despite the fact that digital trade finance solutions have reduced error rates and compliance discrepancies by over a quarter in pilot programs. Furthermore, SMEs, which account for a significant portion of global trade, continue to face barriers in accessing trade finance due to rigid risk assessment frameworks. As international trade expands, trade finance systems are increasingly required to manage not just financial risk but also align with sustainability goals, regulatory frameworks, and geopolitical complexities. This duality\u2014rapid innovation and lingering inefficiencies\u2014makes trade finance both a challenge and an opportunity for global commerce.\n\nKey Findings in Global Trade Finance Market\n\nMarket Forecast (2033) US$ 21,181.13 billion CAGR 7.83% Largest Region (2024) Asia Pacific (42.79%) By Offerings Type Letter of Credit (38.49%) By Application International (67.55%) By Providers Banks (64.87%) By Trade Type Export Finance (54.68%) By Operational Method Traditional (71.61%) By End User Large Enterprises (61.93%) By Industry Manufacturing (45.22%) Top Drivers Emerging crypto-based clearance solutions rapidly accelerate instantaneous global settlement processes.\n\nGrowing decentralized finance platforms reshape institutional involvement in cross-border investments.\n\nIncreasing AI-powered trading algorithms enhance speed, precision, and trade predictability. Top Trends Surging sustainability-linked derivatives gain popularity among ESG-conscious market participants globally.\n\nAdvanced blockchain-based custody systems streamline multi-asset holdings across international exchanges.\n\nGrowing tokenization of tangible assets diversifies trading avenues beyond securities. Top Challenges Regulatory fragmentation complicates unified compliance for cross-border digital trading activities.\n\nHeightened cybersecurity vulnerabilities threaten proprietary system integrity within multinational institutions.\n\nVolatile geopolitics disrupt payment infrastructures and hamper trade facilitation worldwide.\n\nBridging the Gap: Exploring the Key Providers in Trade Finance\n\nThe trade finance market ecosystem is no longer dominated solely by traditional banks. While leading financial institutions such as HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and Barclays remain central to the market, the rise of FinTech companies and multilateral financial institutions (MFIs) has diversified the landscape in 2024. These banks, with their vast global networks, continue to process the majority of trade finance transactions, leveraging their scale and deep capital reserves to provide services such as letters of credit and supply chain financing. For example, HSBC has proven particularly dominant in Asia-Pacific, where its real-time trade platforms and integration of foreign exchange services provide unmatched value to exporters and importers. Similarly, JPMorgan\u2019s innovative use of blockchain and AI technologies has set new benchmarks for efficiency, reducing transaction times while ensuring compliance with global regulations.\n\nAt the same time, FinTech innovators in the global trade finance market are carving out a niche by offering automated platforms that cater to underserved segments, particularly SMEs. These platforms streamline trade finance processes, slashing approval times by up to 40% and enabling smaller businesses to access liquidity quickly. Meanwhile, MFIs such as the World Bank and regional development banks are playing a vital role in addressing financing gaps in emerging economies by underwriting guarantees and providing capacity-building programs. By collaborating with both traditional banks and FinTech firms, MFIs ensure that trade finance becomes more inclusive and accessible. The interplay between these providers has created a dynamic ecosystem, where innovation and collaboration are essential to meeting the evolving demands of global trade.\n\nNavigating Risk and Opportunity: Understanding Trade Finance Instruments\n\nTrade finance encompasses a wide range of instruments that enable businesses to navigate the complexities of international trade. In 2024, the two most prominent instruments\u2014documentary credits such as letters of credit and open account transactions\u2014continue to dominate global trade finance market. Letter of credit with higher market share of nearly 39% remain indispensable for high-risk markets, offering a secure payment mechanism for exporters and importers alike. Despite the rise of more flexible options, letters of credit still account for millions of transactions annually, thanks to their unparalleled ability to mitigate risk. On the other hand, open account transactions have become the preferred method in developed economies, representing over 70% of cross-border commerce due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn addition to these traditional instruments, new trade finance solutions are reshaping the trade finance market landscape. Supply chain financing, for instance, has seen rapid adoption, particularly in industries with complex value chains such as automotive and electronics. Similarly, invoice discounting and factoring have gained traction among SMEs, helping them bridge cashflow gaps and manage working capital more effectively. Even asset-backed financing models are emerging as viable options for high-value exports such as machinery and infrastructure projects. These diverse instruments reflect the adaptability of trade finance, enabling businesses to manage liquidity, reduce payment risks, and expand into new markets. However, the use of these instruments also underscores the importance of trust, collaboration, and regulatory alignment in ensuring their smooth operation.\n\nFrom Manual Labor to Automation: The Digital Transformation of Trade Finance\n\nThe trade finance market has entered a new era of digital transformation, driven by the need for efficiency and compliance in an increasingly complex global trade environment. While manual processes once dominated the sector, advancements in technology are revolutionizing how transactions are conducted. Automated trade platforms, powered by AI and machine learning, have reduced processing times for letters of credit and other instruments by up to 70%. These tools also address long-standing inefficiencies, such as document compliance errors, which have historically delayed international transactions. For example, AI-powered document-checking solutions can now identify and rectify discrepancies in trade documents with far greater accuracy than manual methods.\n\nHowever, the road to digitization is not without its hurdles in the trade finance market. Despite the evident benefits, only a fraction of global customs authorities fully accept electronic documents, creating bottlenecks in the end-to-end trade process. Furthermore, legacy systems still dominate many banks, limiting their ability to adopt cutting-edge technologies. Blockchain, hailed as a game-changer for trade finance, has yet to achieve widespread adoption due to regulatory uncertainty and interoperability challenges. Nonetheless, progress is being made: major blockchain consortia involving global banks have grown significantly in size, and smart contracts are increasingly being piloted to automate payment triggers. As 2024 unfolds, the industry stands at a crossroads, where the adoption of digital tools will determine its ability to meet the demands of a fast-paced, interconnected world.\n\nAsk For Customization @ https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/trade-finance-market\n\nGreen Finance is Poised to Change the Face of Trade Finance Market in Years to Come\n\nThe future of trade finance market is being shaped by two powerful forces: sustainability and technological innovation. In 2024, green finance has emerged as a critical trend, with banks and investors prioritizing projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Green trade finance instruments, tailored for industries such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, are gaining traction, reflecting the growing demand for environmentally conscious financing solutions. Banks are also integrating ESG metrics into their trade finance portfolios, ensuring that their lending practices align with global sustainability goals. This shift is not just a moral imperative but an economic one, as businesses increasingly view ESG compliance as a competitive differentiator.\n\nOn the technological front, blockchain and smart contracts are poised to redefine the trade finance market landscape. By enabling real-time updates and automated payment triggers, these technologies promise to enhance transparency and efficiency while reducing fraud. Similarly, AI-driven platforms are transforming risk assessment processes, making it easier for SMEs to access trade finance. However, the successful adoption of these innovations will depend on global regulatory harmonization. Efforts by organizations such as the G20 to align trade finance regulations across borders are critical in ensuring that new technologies can be deployed at scale. By embracing sustainability and innovation, the trade finance industry has the potential to unlock new levels of efficiency, inclusivity, and resilience, paving the way for a more sustainable and interconnected global economy.\n\nDominant Triad: HSBC, JPMORGAN, and BARCLAYS Shaping Global Trade Finance Market\n\nHSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Barclays Bank stand atop the trade finance market landscape with collective market share of over 27.5% in 2024 due to their expansive international footprint, advanced digital infrastructures, and robust capital reserves. Their ability to support a broad range of instruments\u2014from letters of credit to complex supply chain financing\u2014positions them as first-choice providers for corporates and SMEs alike. Each institution\u2019s global presence also ensures local expertise, making their offerings highly attractive across developed and emerging markets.\n\nHSBC, for example, processes one of the highest volumes of trade finance transactions in the Asia-Pacific region, supported by a dynamic suite of e-platforms that integrates financing, foreign exchange, and real-time shipment tracking. JPMorgan is recognized for its sophisticated digital solutions, particularly in the realm of blockchain pilots and AI-based document verification, slashing processing times while reinforcing compliance. Meanwhile, Barclays has capitalized on strong partnerships with FinTech firms in the trade finance market, focusing on supply chain finance programs that cater to Europe\u2019s industrial base. All three banks operate with stringent due diligence protocols that minimize fraud and money laundering risks, contributing to their leadership status.\n\nCollectively, their global contribution to trade finance spans standardization efforts, technology investments, and product innovation. Recent data from the ICC ranks them among the top three in terms of client satisfaction and transaction volume, highlighting their consistent performance in moving trillions of dollars across borders. Through consolidated expertise, these institutions demonstrate how scale, innovation, and a keen focus on customer needs can set an elevated benchmark, driving the entire market toward higher efficiency and trust.\n\nGlobal Trade Finance Market Key Players:\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nBarclays Bank\n\nWells Fargo & Co.\n\nBanco Santander SA\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nBank of America Corp.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland\n\nBNP Paribas SA\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nCitigroup Inc.\n\nMitsubishi Ufj Financial Group Inc.\n\nCredit Agricole Group\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nAllianz Trade\n\nHSBC Holdings Plc\n\nHSBC Holdings Plc\n\nOther Prominent Players\n\nKey Segmentation:\n\nBy Offering Type\n\nTrade Credit\n\nLetter of Credit\n\nCash Advance\n\nPurchase Order (PO) Finance\n\nReceivables Discounting\n\nTerm Loans\n\nBill of Lading\n\nInsurance\n\nOthers\n\nBy Trade Type\n\nExport Finance\n\nImport Finance\n\nBy Operational Model\n\nTraditional\n\nDigital\n\nBy Provider\n\nBanks\n\nTrade Finance Houses\n\nInsurance Companies\n\nOthers\n\nBy Application\n\nDomestic\n\nInternational\n\nBy End User\n\nSMEs\n\nLarge Enterprises\n\nBy Industry\n\nManufacturing\n\nRetail and E-Commerce\n\nConstruction\n\nOthers\n\nBy Region\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nMiddle East & Africa\n\nSouth America\n\nInquire more about this report before purchase: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/inquire-before-purchase/trade-finance-market\n\nAbout Astute Analytica\n\nAstute Analytica is a global analytics and advisory company which has built a solid reputation in a short period, thanks to the tangible outcomes we have delivered to our clients.

            "content": "The Hang Seng Index (HSI), a key barometer of Hong Kong\u2019s stock market, has recently shown signs of recovery after a challenging few years. As of December 31, 2024, the HSI closed at approximately 20,090.46, reflecting a 1.1% increase driven largely by buying interest from mainland Chinese investors. This resurgence is significant, considering the index has struggled with volatility and declines in previous years. The HSI encompasses 48 blue-chip companies and serves as a critical indicator of the economic health of Hong Kong, which maintains close ties with mainland China. Understanding the current dynamics of the HSI involves analyzing its recent performance, expected target prices, and the factors influencing these trends.\n\nCurrent Performance and Price Analysis\n\nAs of now, the Hang Seng Index is trading around 20,090, with a slight decrease of 0.04% from the previous day. The index opened at 20,083.44 and has fluctuated between a day high of 20,184.88 and a day low of 20,009.95. Over the past week, the index has gained approximately 1.87%, while it has seen an impressive 19.67% increase year-to-date. This upward trend is particularly notable given that the index had faced several years of losses prior to this year.\n\nHang Seng Index Expected Target Price\n\nMarket analysts are cautiously optimistic about the HSI\u2019s trajectory heading into 2025. The expected target price for the index varies among analysts but generally hovers around 21,000 to 22,000 by mid-2025 if current trends continue. This projection hinges on several factors including economic recovery in China and potential policy support from the Hong Kong government.\n\nFactors Affecting the Hang Seng Index\n\nSeveral key factors are influencing the current state and future outlook of the Hang Seng Index:\n\nMainland Chinese Investment: Increased buying from mainland investors has been pivotal in lifting the HSI. Economic Policies: Anticipated support measures from Hong Kong\u2019s government could bolster market confidence. Global Economic Conditions: Changes in global markets and economic indicators also play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment.\n\nHang Seng Index Technical Analysis\n\nFrom a technical perspective, indicators suggest a bullish outlook for the HSI. The moving averages are currently rated as bullish, with many technical indicators showing strong buy signals. This suggests that momentum may continue to favor upward movement in the near term.\n\nHang Seng Index Fundamental Analysis\n\nFundamentally, the HSI reflects broader economic conditions in Hong Kong and its relationship with China. Major constituents such as HSBC Holdings, Alibaba, Tencent, AIA Group, and China Construction Bank dominate the index and significantly influence its performance. As these companies report earnings and adjust their strategies in response to market conditions, their impact on the HSI will be closely monitored.\n\nMarket Capitalization Insights\n\nThe Hang Seng Index represents about 65% of the total market capitalization of companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx). With 82 constituent stocks as of December 2023, it provides a comprehensive view of market performance in Hong Kong.\n\nRecent News Highlights\n\nRecent news surrounding the HSI includes reports of increased trading volumes and investor interest as confidence returns to the market. Notably, derivatives trading has hit record highs amid ongoing volatility, indicating that traders are actively seeking opportunities within this dynamic environment.",

            "content": "High-profile designer moves show how much luxury is hurting By\n\nBloomberg Published\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\nFashion people are obsessed with designer moves. Investors should be too. Earlier this month, named , the creative director of SA\u2019s , as its new top designer in an unprecedented round of musical chairs that has also seen leave and Kim Jones exit , both owned by SE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee catwalk Chanel - Spring-Summer2025 - Womenswear - France - Paris - \u00a9Launchmetrics/spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch high-level creative moves are indicative of the distress in the luxury sector, with demand this year expected to be the weakest since the financial crisis, excluding the Covid-19 disruption five years ago, according to .\n\n\n\nCompanies are trying to find ways to reconnect with customers after price hikes, and one strategy is to bring in buzzy new designers who can inspire well-heeled shoppers to open their Louis Vuitton wallets once more. But top creatives must be the right fit with the brand and importantly, not overshadow the label on the bag or shoe.\n\nThe roots of the current creative schism lie in the bling boom-and-bust of the past five years. As consumers \u2014 particularly in the US \u2014 had little else to spend their money on from late 2020 to mid 2022, they turned to watches and handbags. When they began to tighten their belts in 2023, Chinese consumers, finally freed from stringent lockdowns, took their place.\n\n\n\nThose waves of demand meant brands could push up prices. Erwan Rambourg, an analyst at Holdings Plc, estimates that since 2019, the average price of iconic products in Europe has risen by 54%.\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there was little need to innovate. Along with the belief that luxury consumers would continue to pay ever higher prices, a kind of creative complacency set in too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee catwalk Gucci - Spring-Summer2025 - Womenswear - Italie - Milan - \u00a9Launchmetrics/spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for the past year or so, demand has contracted. This is where the appeal of a new lead designer comes in. One way to excite shoppers is by unveiling a revolutionary look, rather than cutting and pasting the classics. creative talent can be the catalyst for a slew of must-have products.\n\n\n\nWhile top designers are highly paid \u2014 although this is rarely disclosed \u2014 if he or she can achieve this transformation, the payoff for the label can be enormous. Jean-Jacques Guiony, outgoing chief financial officer of LVMH, told investors in October that translating the creativity of its teams into commercial success was one of the most cost-effective growth drivers.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the best example of how a talented individual can reignite a tired brand comes from Kering\u2019s Gucci, under former creative director . A decade ago, his maximalism turbo-charged sales, helping to more than double Gucci\u2019s revenue to \u20ac10.5 billion ($10.9 billion) in 2022, when he left.\n\n\n\nBut a new creative director can\u2019t fix everything. Their vision is crucial in setting the overall direction, but how their products are merchandized \u2014 which pieces find their way into stores \u2014 and communicated to customers in advertising and marketing are also crucial.\n\n\n\nNor is a new designer\u2019s influence instantaneous. It can take about 18 months for he or she to reach their full potential, assembling a team, going through the archives and developing their collections. With a radically new aesthetic, old stock must be cleared, weighing on margins. That may not be such a problem right now, as the luxury market is likely to remain rocky for the next year or so. But a designer must also be a good fit with a house\u2019s overall ethos and the story it weaves around this, Daniel Langer, chief executive officer of consultancy firm Equite and executive professor of luxury strategy at Pepperdine University, told me.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, no designer should be bigger than the name on the store\u2019s door. \u201cA smart brand beyond niche should not have star designers but a star team,\u201d Flavio Cereda, portfolio manager for the Luxury Brands Fund at GAM Holding AG, said.\n\n\n\nTake International SCA: Although Nadege Vanhee is creative director for the house\u2019s women\u2019s ready-to-wear range, it is still best known for its iconic bags. This may be one reason why Chanel has picked Blazy, a relatively young designer, rather than one of the industry\u2019s heavy hitters like Slimane.\n\n\n\nSo which brands and designers should investors be watching particularly in 2025?\n\n\n\nChanel under Blazy is the obvious example. Although Chanel is owned by billionaire brothers Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, its fortunes have implications for listed peers, including Hermes and LVMH\u2019s . The privately held house has been one of the most aggressive on prices since 2019, with a large 2.55 flap bag up 91%, according to Rambourg\u2019s analysis. It needs to reenergize and prove to customers that its double C logo is still worth the money. No wonder Bruno Pavlovsky, the head of Chanel\u2019s fashion division, told The Business of Fashion that Chanel was \u201cready to let itself be transported.\u201d\n\n\n\nKering\u2019s Bottega Veneta has appointed Louise Trotter, creative director of , to succeed Blazy. His departure is a blow to the French conglomerate, which is trying to revive Gucci. Bottega Veneta was the only one of its luxury houses to increase sales in the third quarter. Now, it too is in creative transition. But as Mario Ortelli, CEO of luxury advisory firm Ortelli & Co., told me: \u201cWhen Chanel calls, it is like Real Madrid calling. No one can resist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee catwalk Carven - Spring-Summer2025 - Womenswear - France - Paris - \u00a9Launchmetrics/spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\nTrotter won plaudits at and Carven, but she has primarily worked in premium brands, with a focus on clothing. Bottega Veneta is pure luxury, with a heavy emphasis on accessories. It piles more pressure on Kering to fix its other houses led by Gucci.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Celine has a good chance of thriving after Slimane. He set the tone, introducing menswear and embellishing bags with the double-C Triomphe logo. New designer Michael Rider, formerly at Corp., should be able to continue in this vein while adapting the aesthetic, much in the way that has done since succeeding Slimane at Yves in 2016.\n\n\n\nAnd of course, investors will be wondering where the next creative rupture might come.\n\n\n\nGroup Plc\u2019s pivot away from trying to become Britain\u2019s answer to LVMH and toward a combination of Ralph Lauren and SpA raises questions over whether , the designer appointed by former CEO , will remain. Given that Gucci has struggled to lift sales under Sabato de Sarno, the spotlight has also naturally turned to his tenure.\n\n\n\nAssuming the typical stint of a designer is five to seven years, then , creative director of womenswear at Dior since 2016, is also worth watching. Sales at the house are slowing after spectacular growth, while LVMH is undergoing a series of management changes as CEO installs the next generation of leaders. Chanel\u2019s outfit change could have implications here too.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile , Dior\u2019s former creative director, has left Maison , owned by privately held OTB Group. Where might he turn up?\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the biggest signal for investors will be when the designer merry-go-round stops spinning quite so quickly. That would indicate that the sector is stabilizing after its annus horribilis.\n\n\n\nFor while luxury and sport are moving ever closer \u2014 with LVMH\u2019s sponsorship of the Paris for example \u2014 creative directors that resemble football coaches, moving on when results disappoint, are a bad look for an industry that prides itself on thinking long-term.",

The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets.\n\nLindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk.\n\nThat said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK\u2019s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives.\n\nIn recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield . In this article, we are going to take a look at where HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJanus Henderson\u2019s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish\u2019s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA financial specialist advising a corporate client at the trading desk of a high-stakes bank.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC)\n\nDividend Yield as of December 29: 6.19%\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) is a financial services company, based in London. The company serves millions of customers through its different businesses. HSBC's stock has experienced a significant increase, driven by its ambitious restructuring initiatives and strong third-quarter results, which have positioned the bank for sustained growth. Through these strategic efforts, HSBC is not only optimizing its operations but also laying the groundwork for future expansion. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 22%.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC), although a globally diversified company, derives a significant portion of its revenue from Asia, which accounts for about half of its total earnings. The rest of its income comes from various global markets, primarily through services like commercial banking and wealth management. Recently, the company has made efforts to deepen its focus on the Asian region.\n\nFor the third quarter, HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) reported revenue of $17 billion, reflecting a $1.1 billion increase from the same period last year and a $0.3 billion rise from the previous quarter, indicating positive business momentum. In addition, the bank announced $4.8 billion in shareholder returns, which includes a third interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed by the time of the full-year results in February. Given its steady performance in Q3 and its relatively low price-to-earnings ratio, the stock appears undervalued and poised for growth.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC), one of the best FTSE dividend stocks, has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders since 1997. It declared its third interim dividend of $0.10 in October, payable to shareholders on record on December 19. The stock has a dividend yield of 6.19%, as of December 29.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) was included in 14 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, the same as in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. The stakes owned by these funds have a total value of over $98 million.\n\nOverall HSBC ranks 2nd on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of HSBC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HSBC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Both men will now be able to use the title \u201cSir.\u201d\n\nThe highest award in this year\u2019s list went to Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, known for works such as The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go. He was made a Companion of Honour, an award limited to 65 holders at any one time.\n\nThe honors, awarded twice yearly, are given in the name of the monarch and recommended by a panel that considers suggestions from government departments and political parties as well as from members of the public. The full list published late Monday covers the whole spectrum of British society, recognizing politicians, civil servants, academics and charity workers.\n\nKhan was joined in receiving a knighthood by the Tory former West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street, former Conservative Party deputy chairman Ranil Jayawardena, who served in Liz Truss\u2019s short-lived cabinet, three times Schools Minister Nick Gibb, and former Housing Minister Marcus Jones.\n\nThere were damehoods for Emily Thornberry, who served in Keir Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet while in opposition but was not named to the prime minister\u2019s top team when Labour swept to power earlier this year, and for Patricia Hewitt, who served in then-Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s cabinet in the early 2000s.\n\nKen McCallum, director-general of the UK\u2019s domestic intelligence service, MI5, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, while Tamara Finkelstein \u2014 a senior civil servant who missed out on the top job of Cabinet Secretary earlier this year \u2014 was made a Dame Commander in the same order.\n\nNetwork Rail CEO Andrew Haines and M&G Plc chairman Edward Braham also won knighthoods, while there were lesser awards for a host of names well-known in the City of London. Catherine La Torre, former CEO of the government-backed investment fund British Patient Capital, UK Infrastructure Bank CEO John Flint, and British Business Bank CEO Louis Taylor were named Commanders of the Order of the British Empire. TechUK\u2019s Julian David and TheCityUK\u2019s Miles Celic were made Officers of the Order of the British Empire, a rank lower.\n\nCBEs also went to Poppy Gustafsson, the co-founder of cyber security firm Darktrace and Starmer\u2019s investment minister, London Stock Exchange Group Chairman Donald Robert, former UK president of advertising giant WPP Karen Blackett, former Climate Change Committee CEO Christopher Stark, and the Oscar-nominated actress Carey Mulligan, known for her roles in Promising Young Woman and The Great Gatsby.\n\nAs well as Southgate \u2014 who stepped down as England manager this summer after guiding the team to the European Championship finals \u2014 there were honors for former West Ham United manager David Moyes and the broadcaster and former Formula 1 racing driver Martin Brundle. A host of Olympic and Paralympic medalists were recognized, including the athletes Dina Asher-Smith, Keely Hodgkinson, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Hannah Cockroft, the cyclist Tom Pidcock, the rower Helen Glover and the swimmer Duncan Scott.\n\nWell-known broadcasters featured on the honors list, with Stephen Fry awarded a knighthood for his services to mental health and gardening presenter Alan Titchmarsh given a CBE. Several people involved in the campaign to bring justice to sub-postmasters wrongfully accused of theft and fraud were also recognized, as were two people involved in the inquiry into the decades-old infected blood scandal.\n\nJacqueline Wilson, best known for children\u2019s novels such as the Tracy Beaker series, and Leszek Borysiewicz, former vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, were named Knights Grand Cross \u2014 the highest class in the Order of the British Empire.\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Full-time workers seldom have the time, and part-time workers seldom have the cash.\n\nSo how can the average person bring in extra income with just a few quid a day and minimal time?\n\nThere are a few options, but my favourite is investing in reliable companies with a proven track record of paying dividends. Such companies regularly reward shareholders by paying out a percentage of their holdings in cash or shares.\n\nThe beauty of this method is that it requires minimal cash and time to get started. All it takes is an investment account and a few quid a day.\n\nFor UK residents, investing via a Stocks and Shares ISA is the most tax-efficient option, with a \u00a320,000 a year tax-free allowance.\n\nPlease note that tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each client and may be subject to change in future.

Readers are responsible for carrying out their own due diligence and for obtaining professional advice before making any investment decisions.\n\nThe benefits and risks\n\nThe key benefit of investing in dividends is the simplicity. A bit of research reveals top dividend-paying companies and from there, it\u2019s a simple matter of choosing how much.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to go all in on day one. Even as little as \u00a35 is a good start. This way, first-time investors can get a feel for what works without staking too much.\n\nThen there are the risks.\n\nStock prices go up and down, so even if a company pays decent dividends, there\u2019s a chance of losing money. There are ways to gauge which companies are likely to perform better but there\u2019s no guarantee.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it\u2019s best to pick several stocks from a variety of sectors to avoid a single point of failure.\n\nWhat to look for in a dividend stock\n\nMany companies pay a dividend but not all are considered dividend stocks. True \u2018dividend stocks\u2019 are those that pay consistently and have a high yield.\n\nThe yield is the percentage returned per year. For example, a 5% yield on a \u00a31,000 investment would return \u00a350 a year.\n\nBut dividends alone don\u2019t mean the company is reliable. It\u2019s also important to assess the business by gauging the viability of its products, its position in the industry, and its accounts.\n\nApplying the above concepts\n\nA passive income portfolio may consist of popular FTSE 100 stocks like HSBC, Legal & General, Tesco and BT Group. These are all well-established companies with a track record of paying higher-than-average dividends.\n\nBut one stock I like at the moment is Aviva (LSE: AV.). The massive insurance firm recently secured a deal to acquire struggling motor insurer Direct Line for a 22% discount. If it can revive the firm, the purchase could pay off in spades.\n\nLately, the shares have been on a bit of a downer but they\u2019re still up 6.5% this year. That means it\u2019s outperformed major competitor Prudential, down 25%.\n\nDividend-wise, it\u2019s impressive, with a 7.4% yield and a 73% payout ratio.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s made several cuts over the past 20 years during weak economic periods. That adds a risk that more cuts could happen if things go south.\n\nBut with the new acquisition, analysts forecast growth in the coming year. I believe the combination of growth and dividends could make it an excellent addition to a dividend portfolio.\n\nThat\u2019s why I recently bought the shares and plan to buy more next year.",
