A ReRAM crossbar array chip, integrated into the Back End of Line (BEOL) of CMOS technology, is leveraged to establish dense coupling elements between oscillator neurons, allowing phase-encoded analog information to be processed in-memory. We also realize an ONN architecture design with the coupling ReRAM array. To validate the architecture experimentally, we present a conductive metal oxide (CMO)/HfOx ReRAM array chip integrated with a 2-by-2 ring oscillator-based network. The system successfully retrieves patterns through correct binary phase locking. This proof of concept underscores the potential of ReRAM technology for large-scale, integrated ONNs.\u201d\n\nFind the technical paper here.

The test used over 4,600 two-qubit gates\u2014a measure of circuit depth\u2014without degrading into random noise. According to the researchers, this is the largest instance of such a problem to yield useful results on real hardware.\n\nThe authors write: \u201cIn the case of Quantinuum H2-1, the experiments of 50 and 56 qubits are already above the capabilities of exact simulation in HPC systems and the results are still meaningful.\u201d\n\nAddressing Bottlenecks\n\nThe study aimed to assess how today\u2019s quantum computers perform as circuits scale in both width and depth \u2014 two key bottlenecks for running useful quantum algorithms. They tested 19 quantum processing units (QPUs) from five vendors: IBM, IonQ, Quantinuum, Rigetti and IQM.\n\nAt the center of the test was a protocol called linear-ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA), a simplified version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Unlike variational approaches that tune parameters, LR-QAOA uses fixed, linearly ramped gate schedules. It was chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and the fact that it could be implemented across many hardware platforms.\n\nThe benchmark asked each system to solve versions of the MaxCut problem, which involves dividing a graph into two groups to maximize the weight of edges between them. MaxCut is considered difficult for classical machines at scale, making it a suitable candidate to probe quantum performance.\n\nResearchers ran LR-QAOA on problems defined over three types of graph layouts: a linear chain of qubits, each chip\u2019s native layout, and a fully connected graph, which requires more gate operations. In each case, they measured how far the quantum computer\u2019s answers were from the best-known solution, using a metric called the approximation ratio. If the result stayed better than a random sampler, the system was considered to have passed the test.\n\nThe Quantinuum H2-1 passed the test at 56 qubits, running three layers of LR-QAOA involving 4,620 two-qubit gates.\n\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, this is the largest implementation of QAOA to solve an FC combinatorial optimization problem on real quantum hardware that is certified to give a better result over random guessing,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nSpeaking on the findings, Chris Langer, a Fellow, a key inventor and architect for the Quantinuum hardware, and advisor to the CEO, writes in a company blog post that the firm is focused on benchmarks and improving performance to set new standards.\n\n\u201cWe take benchmarking seriously at Quantinuum. We lead in nearly every industry benchmark, from best-in-class gate fidelities to a 4000x lead in quantum volume, delivering top performance to our customers,\u201d Langer writes. \u201cOur Quantum Charged-coupled Device (QCCD) architecture has been the foundation of our success, delivering consistent performance gains year-over-year. Unlike other architectures, QCCD offers all-to-all connectivity, world-record fidelities, and advanced features like real-time decoding. Altogether, it\u2019s clear we have superior performance metrics across the board.\u201d\n\nIBM Shows Strength in Depth\n\nWhile Quantinuum demonstrated coherence at larger scales, IBM showed strength in pushing depth. The team ran a 100-qubit problem on IBM\u2019s ibm fez chip using up to 10,000 layers of LR-QAOA\u2014nearly a million two-qubit gates. Though the system eventually thermalized \u2014 a process where qubits lose their quantum coherence and settle into lower-energy, non-informative states \u2014 some coherent information persisted until around 300 layers.\n\nThe QPU time that was committed to obtain 1,000 samples running the p = 10,000 LR-QAOA circuit was 21 seconds, according to the researchers. Just a note: This refers to aggregate QPU execution time, not including queuing or classical processing overhead. However, the researchers added that this as the largest experiment by gate count to date.\n\nIBM\u2019s newer Heron-generation devices consistently outperformed older Eagle chips in both depth and width tests. Fractional gates\u2014custom gate implementations introduced on Heron devices\u2014reduced the number of required two-qubit operations by half, allowing longer circuits with less error buildup.\n\nFor example, ibm fez achieved an approximation ratio of 0.808 on a 100-qubit chain problem using fractional gates. In comparison, older IBM chips often failed to maintain coherence beyond 20 qubits or 100 layers.\n\nStill, the study\u2019s authors caution that benchmarks like these should not be viewed as absolute measures of superiority. Performance varied depending on circuit structure, device layout, and problem instance. The authors observed that IBM\u2019s ibm marrakesh had stronger results than ibm fez for small problem sizes, but fez held up better as circuit size increased.\n\nModality Tradeoffs\n\nThe benchmarking protocol also offers insight into architectural tradeoffs. Trapped ion systems like Quantinuum and IonQ showed high fidelity and full connectivity between qubits, which made them suitable for fully connected problems. But they are currently limited by slow gate times and lower total gate counts.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in a hypothetical 25-qubit FC problem with p=100 and 1,000 shots, ionq aria 2 would require 18,000 seconds based solely on the 2-qubit gate time, while ibm fez would need 0.51 seconds. This disparity emerges from the 2-qubit gate time and the inability to execute these gates in parallel in trapped ion QPUs,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nSuperconducting qubits, used by IBM, IQM, and Rigetti, run much faster but face challenges scaling depth due to noise accumulation.\n\nReliable, Scalable Benchmarking Tool\n\nBeyond comparing systems, the authors suggest that LR-QAOA could serve as a reliable and scalable benchmarking tool for the industry. Existing metrics such as quantum volume (QV) or error per layered gate (EPLG) can miss platform-specific issues like crosstalk or routing limitations.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Different candidate benchmarks to capture essential aspects of performance should be proposed,\u201d they write, adding that there is a need for practical, reproducible tests as hardware continues to evolve.\n\nThe protocol\u2019s simplicity \u2014 using fixed parameters and requiring no optimization loops \u2014 also made it easy to deploy across platforms. Even with as few as seven samples on Quantinuum\u2019s H2-1, researchers could distinguish meaningful results from random outputs, offering a way to test high-cost platforms efficiently.\n\nStill, the benchmark is not without limits. Performance depends on fixed schedule parameters, which were set using heuristics rather than optimal tuning. And while the study avoided artificially enhancing results through methods like warm starts or postprocessing, it acknowledged that such techniques could mask hardware deficiencies if not fairly accounted for.\n\nLooking ahead, the team says next steps include refining schedule parameters, improving circuit routing strategies, and extending tests to other optimization problems. But the broader message remains: as quantum systems grow, reliable, scalable, and transparent benchmarks will be essential for tracking progress\u2014and understanding what useful quantum computing really looks like.\n\nFor a deep dive into the technical aspects of the study, the full paper is available on arXiv. Researchers use pre-print servers, such as arXiv, to receive immediate feedback on their work, however, it\u2019s not yet undergone official peer review, a key step of the scientific method.\n\nThe research team included: J.

            "content": "Vodafone Idea has awarded IBM and Kyndryl a multi-year, bifurcated IT outsourcing deal after renegotiating the terms, chief technology officer Jagbir Singh has told Moneycontrol. Singh didn\u2019t share the deal size but sources put its combined value between $500 million and $600 million.The new agreement comes at a significantly lower value than the previous $800 million deal with IBM, which ended in April 2024. The move is an effort by the cash-strapped telecom to cuts costs.\u201cInstead of providing the contract to one vendor, we have gone with whoever is the expert in the space,\u201d Singh said.The latest deal significantly reduces reliance on IBM, as the US tech giant will now handle only key areas such as application development and management, he said.Kyndryl, which, too, is US-based, has been awarded key processes related to managed infrastructure, including maintaining servers, storage, and firewalls. Vodafone Idea has also awarded contracts to other smaller vendors to ensure vendor diversity.The telecom company has chosen to involve more vendors to reduce overall operating costs and work with specialised firms in specific areas rather than renewing the entire agreement with IBM alone, he said.The goal of bringing in new vendors is to engage specialised providers who can deliver better results at lower costs\u2014 a strategy it has also employed to secure the best deals for its 4G and 5G network contracts.The moves are slated to unlock cost and operational efficiencies and boost Vi's productivity, Singh said.This cost reduction aligns with Vodafone Idea\u2019s ongoing financial challenges as it seeks government support to manage its AGR and spectrum dues.\u201cFor the infrastructure part, like maintaining servers, storage, and firewalls, we have given that part to Kyndrl and the applications part to IBM,\u201d Singh said.\u201cSeparately, we have awarded the testing part to another vendor. Instead of providing the contract to one vendor, we have gone with whoever is the expert in the space.\u201dThe telecom operator has brought digital development and network-managed services in-house to leverage talent and save capex and opex.To further cut operating expenditure (OPEX), the company has taken many processes in house.\u201cWe have given a lot of house-on-in-house expertise to the company. So, all are my responsibilities, whether IT, network, or digital. For digital, most of the development is in-house. Besides, managed services for the network are being taken care of in-house,\u201d Singh said.The Vodafone Idea's in-house network and IT team is also focused on automation.The firm is also training its employees on cloud, IP/MPLS, AI tools, and machine learning. \u201cWhile we haven't increased the manpower or laid off employees, we have increased the scope of the manpower employed by doing automation\u2026we are saving money on the network integration part by doing it ourselves,\u201d Singh said.The IT outsourcing deals are critical for Vodafone Idea, which aims to enhance its infrastructure to support its expanding 4G network and prepare for the planned 5G rollout in the top 100 cities within its 17 priority markets.The tech outsourcing deal's renewal follows a mega $3.6-billion deal with Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung to secure 4G and 5G network equipment over three years.The network and IT outsourcing deals are part of the company\u2019s three-year capex plan of $6.6 billion, which is directed towards expanding the 4G population coverage from 1.03 billion to 1.2 billion, launching 5G in critical markets and expanding capacity in line with data growth.",

            "content": "AWS Vs. Azure Vs. GCP Vs. Oracle Vs. IBM Customer Spending Face-Off: Report From how much customers are spending per month on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud to how many cloud clients are leveraging MSPs, CRN breaks down the most important takeaways from Flexera\u2019s new 2025 State of the Cloud report that partners should know about.\n\nTop Public Cloud Providers Similar to global market share, the top five public cloud providers being used are AWS, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft Azure and Oracle. AWS is the top public cloud provider being used by respondents for running workloads at 79 percent. Microsoft placed in second with 77 percent of respondents running workloads on Azure. Approximately 46 percent of respondents use Google\u2019s GCP to run workloads on. About 27 percent use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to run workloads on, while 17 percent leverage the IBM Cloud. Most respondents use AWS for running significant workloads at 53 percent, while Azure is the most used cloud platform for client\u2019s running some workloads on at 31 percent. Google Cloud is seeing the highest number of respondents experiment on its platform at 20 percent.\n\nSpending Per Month On AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle And IBM Similar to 2024, AWS and Azure are nearly tied across all spending tiers\u2014although Azure has a slight edge for those spending $1 million or more monthly. For those spending less than $50,000 monthly, Google Cloud Platform is the leader. Breaking down each public cloud company and the amount respondents spend per month: For Azure, 50 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 19 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For AWS, 48 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 17 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For GCP, 44 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 7 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For Oracle, 29 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 3 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For IBM, 24 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 3 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million.\n\nEnterprise Spending On AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, And IBM Flexera broke down respondents for how much they spend on public cloud into two categories: enterprises and SMBs (next slide). Looking specifically at what enterprises spend per month on public cloud, enterprise respondents slightly lean more toward Azure usage compared to AWS in terms of leadership. For Azure, 22 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 47 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For AWS, 21 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 44 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For GCP, 8 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 43 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For Oracle, 3 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 32 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For IBM, 3 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 26 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month.\n\nSMB Spending On AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, And IBM Looking at the results from small-medium businesses (SMBs), respondents slightly lean more toward AWS compared to Azure in terms of leadership. Google Cloud Platform is in third place, with Flexera pointing out that 2 percent of SMBs are now spending $1 million or more per month on GCP compared to zero percent in 2024. Here\u2019s a breakdown on how much SMBs are spending per month on the top five public cloud platforms. For AWS, 67 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on AWS, while 6 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For Azure, 62 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on Azure, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $2 million. For GCP, 49 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on Google Cloud, while 3 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For Oracle, 15 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on OCI, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For IBM, 15 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on IBM Cloud, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $2 million. No SMBs reported spending over $5 million per month on any cloud provider.\n\nNearly All Respondents Using Cloud Provider Discounts Cloud provider discounts from AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are a critical way customers can help with costs. Approximately 96 percent of all respondents are using at least one of the cloud provider discount options. The most frequently used discount is the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, at 45 percent, which is a common contractual vehicle for organizations that use Microsoft products and services. The second highest used discount at 44 percent is the Google Committed Use discounts for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In third place is the AWS Reserved Instances discount which 42 percent of respondents leverage, followed by AWS\u2019 Enterprise Discount Program (EDP) at 40 percent. Bespoke negotiated discounts are more common with Oracle at 35 percent, and IBM at 27 percent than with other providers. \u201cThis is most likely due to existing contractual relationships with these providers for other services that are leveraged to obtain cloud consumption discounts,\u201d Flexera said. The average number of public clouds used is 2.4, and the average number of discount options used across all cloud providers is 3.9. \u201cThis is good to see, but there\u2019s still room for additional discounts to be used for most organizations,\u201d Flexera said.\n\nAnnual Public Cloud Spend Flexera saw an increase in public cloud spending in 2025 compared to 2024. For example, 33 percent of customers report spending over $12 million per year, up from 29 percent in 2024. \u201cThis supports the idea that as cloud costs rise, more workloads are moved to\u2014or born in\u2014 the cloud,\u201d said Flexera. Breaking down the overall numbers: Approximately 33 percent spend between $12 million to over $60 million annually. About 41 percent spend between $1.2 to $12 million annually. Around 24 percent spend $1.2 million annually or lower. Looking at enterprise respondents, about 55 percent spend over $6 million per year, while 44 percent spend between $600,000 to $6 million. In terms of SMB respondents, 81 percent spend $2.4 million or less annually on public cloud, while 17 percent spend over $2.4 million annually.\n\nHybrid Cloud Vs. Public And Private Some other key findings in Flexera\u2019s report include that 70 percent of respondents have embraced hybrid cloud strategies by using at least one public and one private cloud. The remaining 30 percent either use only public cloud or private cloud. Large enterprises make use of multi-cloud tools more than smaller organizations, regardless of the tool type. \u201cOrganizations seem to have found their steady state\u2014that is, the mix of clouds that meets their current needs. For the most part, that involves at least one public and one private cloud,\u201d said Flexera.",

Alignments like the collaboration with Datavault AI Inc. in IBM's Partner Plus program and several key strategic partnerships, such as those with Finastra, NVIDIA, and the Basque Government, may have fueled investor confidence. Despite IBM's mixed earnings results, where revenue slightly increased but net income fell, its prospects for growth through technological advancements in AI and quantum computing appear promising. Market conditions featuring recovering indexes further augmented IBM's favorable pricing environment during the period.\n\nNYSE:IBM Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, IBM has delivered an impressive total shareholder return of 184.22%, reflecting its stock price increase coupled with cash dividends. This robust performance stands out, especially considering IBM's returns over the past year surpassed both the US market and the US IT industry, which returned 8.1% and 8.9%, respectively.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to this long-term success. The launch of IBM's z17 mainframe and the development of generative AI have strengthened its leadership in key technology areas. Moreover, consistent quarterly cash dividends, reaching US$1.67 per share by early 2025, have supported shareholder returns. Recent strategic alliances, including collaborations with Datavault AI and Finastra, have bolstered IBM's market position. Furthermore, IBM's investment in expanding its software portfolio through global platforms like AWS has widened its market reach considerably. Analysts, however, have pointed to challenges such as geopolitical tensions and the strong U.S. dollar, which could pose risks to future growth.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "The survey identified four distinct groups emerging in the utilities industry based on their grid modernization strategies:\n\n\u00b7 Pioneering integrators represent 14% of the total that is surveyed and are the most advanced in grid modernization. They excel in capabilities such as simulating grid performance, orchestrating bidirectional networks, and setting integration standards, which clearly distinguish their adaptability to modern energy demands. They are less advanced in using self-monitoring assets to limit outage and asset damage and in integrating advanced metering infrastructure 2.0 (AMI) with automated outage management customer communication systems.\n\n\u00b7 Energy optimizers comprise 21% of the total that is surveyed and prioritize the management and optimization of energy usage through advanced technologies. They display a strong commitment to demand response, with a solid understanding of integrating advanced metering infrastructure. Nevertheless, they are also less advanced in implementing bidirectional networks, reflecting a gap in their technological sophistication.\n\n\u00b7 Power connectors constitute the largest group, 35% of the total that is surveyed. They excel in establishing connectivity and operational functionality within energy networks, and they exhibit a strength in linking DERs with grid systems. Yet they require enhancements in their digital and automation infrastructure. Their integration of smart assets signals a slower adoption pace in embracing the communication and data management aspects of smart grids.\n\n\u00b7 Moderate achievers represent 29% of the total of those surveyed and show that solid progress with meeting demand flexibility, but their peers are outpacing them in the adoption and integration of advanced energy technologies.\n\nBy identifying with the group most like them, and understanding the respective behaviors, strategies, and actions, utilities can make better-informed decisions and tailor strategies accordingly.\n\nDespite this patchwork landscape, there are three key objectives to pursue to become future-ready.\n\n1. Increase resilience and reliability\n\nBuilding grid resilience requires a comprehensive approach to strengthen its ability to prevent, detect and recover from failures or disruptions. Key tactics include grid self-control and optimization, interconnectivity and integration, and flexible load management with tools such as dynamic pricing or demand response. Investments in predictive analytics and Volt/VAR optimization (VVO), for example, are proving vital for grid stability and efficiency. Interconnectivity, supported by Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) and fault detection, are enabling leaps forward in real-time monitoring and control. Finally, dynamic pricing and demand response programs are effective in regulating energy use. Notably, 82% of pioneering integrators use real-time pricing, compared to just half of their peers.\n\n2. Accelerate the clean energy transition\n\nTo accelerate the clean energy transition, meanwhile, utilities must be able to manage renewable intermittency. A range of technologies are emerging to tackle variability. Flexible generation management, for example, adjusts to fluctuations by using quick-response sources and energy storage for stability. Large-scale renewables integration also requires enhanced grid capacity, real-time data analysis and continuous monitoring. Integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) is helping boost grid flexibility, with about 60% of utilities adopting standardized interconnection. Blockchain technology is also emerging to enable energy trading at distribution level.\n\n3. Improve operational excellence\n\nUnderlying operational excellence is key to optimizing grid efficiency, asset usage, and overall system performance. Strategic planning and demand modelling tools play an important role in managing grid congestion. Incorporating climate and weather forecasts, meanwhile, enhances the management of renewable energy resources. Continuous asset monitoring, automation and maintenance are crucial for maintaining grid infrastructure, with real-time tracking and automated alerts preventing costly failures. According to this survey, nearly two-thirds of utilities are already creating asset failure forecasts to evaluate failures\u2019 impact on network performance.",

IBM is laying off around 9,000 employees in 2025, primarily in the United States, with significant cuts in the Cloud Classic division. Insiders suggest this is part of an ongoing workforce restructuring that includes shifting roles offshore, particularly to India.\n\nTech giant IBM is in the process of cutting around 9,000 jobs in the United States this year \u2014 a move that could result in a significant shift of roles to India, according to a report by The Register. The layoffs are affecting several divisions in the US, including IBM\u2019s Cloud Classic unit, which was built on its SoftLayer infrastructure acquisition, sources said. Around a quarter of that team is believed to be impacted. But while job losses are mounting in the West, there is growing evidence that India could benefit from this restructuring.\n\nInsiders said IBM has been steadily shifting roles to India over the past few years, and this round of downsizing is no different. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move as many roles to India as possible,\u201d one source told The Register. Another laid-off US employee also pointed out that IBM currently has far more job openings in India than in the US. Even CEO Arvind Krishna has publicly spoken in the past about IBM\u2019s strategy to refocus its workforce towards India, where talent is abundant and operating costs are lower. \u201cThis is not even inside information anymore,\u201d a source was quoted as saying.\n\nIf these transitions play out as expected, Indian tech workers \u2014 particularly those with cloud, infrastructure, sales, and consulting experience \u2014 may see more job opportunities open up. Roles that are being phased out in the West may be created or expanded in India, where IBM already has a large presence in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Chennai.\n\nThis comes at a time when global IT firms are increasingly adopting a \"global delivery model,\" where teams in India handle core operations, development, support, and back-office functions. Indian IT professionals with skills in AI, cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud, cybersecurity, and internal enterprise systems may find themselves in greater demand as IBM reshuffles its workforce.",

The broader market index rose 0.64%, blue-chip stocks gained 0.85%, and the NASDAQ Composite, still in correction territory, closed 0.31% higher.\n\nEarly Tuesday, stocks began to decline again as investors focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting starting today. The key announcement for traders will come Wednesday when the Fed announces its interest rate decision, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Since September, the Fed has cut interest rates three times and still, the broader market entered a correction.\n\nDespite uncertainty from President Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies and geopolitical strategies, some analysts remain optimistic about AI\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe retain our view that there is more to go in stocks, and we keep our conviction in the long-term opportunities in stocks linked to both the artificial intelligence and power and resources transformational innovations,\u201d UBS chief investment office said in a note Monday, according to CNBC.\n\nAmid turbulence and uncertainty on Wall Street, looking at recent insider trades can provide valuable insights, as executives often have a deeper understanding of their companies. For example, when a CEO or CFO buys company stock, it may indicate strong confidence in the business\u2019s future.\n\nHowever, insider selling doesn\u2019t always signal a lack of confidence. It could be due to personal financial needs or a desire to diversify investments. These sales are often made through pre-arranged plans, like 10b5-1 plans, to avoid any appearance of improper timing.\n\nWhile insider activity can be informative, it\u2019s important to consider it alongside the company\u2019s financial health, market trends, and industry developments.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener to analyze recent trading activities in several popular stocks. For each stock, we noted the number of insiders who recently acquired shares and the company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Insiders Buying: 1\n\nMarket Capitalization: $234.57 billion\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and internationally.

Now it is moving directly into the fray of shareholder activism by using its financial muscle in the boardroom debates of blue-chip U.S. companies.\n\nHeritage is blazing an important trail, armed with the resources to counter universities that have not been shy about asserting their leftist influence over corporations and asset managers on issues like supporting the anti-Israel boycott, divest and sanction (the BDS movement).\n\nHeritage is now using its voting shares to place proposals on the ballots of corporate America. Heritage and its legal partner, Alliance Defending Freedom, emerged victorious this month in a challenge against IBM in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates markets.\n\nThe SEC ruled IBM shareholders can vote on a resolution filed by Heritage requiring IBM\u2019s board of directors to issue a report about the effects of the company\u2019s DEI policies at IBM\u2019s annual shareholder meeting April 29.\n\nTroublingly, IBM\u2019s chief executive was caught on camera bragging about embracing race-based quotas in hiring, leading to a lawsuit from the Missouri attorney general due to a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cAmericans have woken up to the reality that their pensions, savings, and investments are being used to push corporate agendas that don\u2019t align with their values,\u201d said John Backiel, Heritage\u2019s vice president of finance and accounting. \u201cA growing number of forward-thinking companies have already rolled back their DEI policies, and the sooner the rest follow suit, the better.\u201d\n\nADF is also helping Heritage place shareholder proposals at Airbnb and CVS.\n\nAt Airbnb, Heritage is calling for resistance to antisemitic demands for divestment from Israel.\n\nJerry Bowyer of Bowyer Research noted in his Substack that \u201cAirbnb has previously taken down listings in Israel, and more recently faced calls from external activists to do so since October 7.\u201d\n\nAmong many of Heritage\u2019s partners is the State Financial Officers Foundation, where I previously served as an economic research fellow and where Boyer served on the national advisory board. In fact, it was a series of Innovation Prizes awarded from the storied policy leader that spurred activity by SFOF and ADF and others on the issues.\n\nThe State Financial Officers Foundation is a coalition of 28 state financial leaders. During the heat of the Biden administration, the group brought its market force to bear\u2014roughly $3 trillion in public assets under management\u2014to force banks and other financial institutions to quit targeting conservatives and imposing far-left ideologies on taxpayers.\n\n\u201cHeritage is the first big political nonprofit over the wall on corporate engagement, and they\u2019re an excellent example of the willingness it\u2019s going to take to build the push for political neutrality nationwide,\u201d Bowyer continued. \u201cEvery conservative and faith-based nonprofit, whether in D.C. or elsewhere should be using their financial leverage in similar ways. It\u2019s our hope that many will follow Heritage\u2019s example here\u2014and we can\u2019t wait to be a part of that process.\u201d\n\nWhile I don\u2019t like to see partisan battles playing out in corporate boardrooms, I am looking forward to organizations like Heritage holding corporations accountable for when they veer off into leftist ideology.\n\nCustomers are best served by companies that remain focused on creating value and serving them rather than weaponizing business for political ends and forcing shoppers to embrace world views unaligned with their values.\n\nCarrie Sheffield is a senior policy analyst for the Center for Economic Opportunity at Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Every other day there are reports of a company announcing or planning job cuts as part of a restructuring move or simple cost-cutting. Now, it has emerged that US tech giant IBM too could soon be announcing such a measure.\n\nOften nicknamed ' Big Blue ', IBM ( International Business Machines Corporation), is a multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. The firm is known for its IT services, consulting, and technology solutions.\n\nIBM Employee Layoffs 2025\n\nThe American tech major could be planning to sack thousands at various locations around the US, according to a report in The Register. IBM insiders believe that the company is laying off several people, including a quarter of staff at its Cloud Classic operation.\n\nThe Big Blue is learnt to be planning to issue thousands of pink slips. \"Concrete numbers are being kept private. It is in the thousands,\" The Register reported, citing a source. However, there has been no official word from the Big Blue.\n\nWorth mentioning here is that IBM CFO James Kavanaugh had in January said, \"We expect workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with prior years.\"\n\nThe Register estimates that the latest round of job cuts at the Big Blue could be around 9,000. However, it is hard to gauge if these layoffs are a specific round of layoffs, trimming teams on older products, or the ongoing process of shedding staff. The report added that the employees in Raleigh, North Carolina; New York City and State; Dallas, Texas, and California, have been let go.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech giant's revenue for the October-December 2024 period rose 1 per cent to $17.6 billion while its software revenue increased by 10 per cent. IBM's consulting revenue declined by 2 per cent while infrastructure revenue fell by 8 per cent.\n\nEnd of article",

            "content": "AI cloud platform CoreWeave has applied to go public. The company, which specializes in offering GPU infrastructure for AI workloads, is aiming for a valuation of up to 26 billion dollars in the planned IPO.\n\nCoreWeave wants to issue 49 million shares at a price between 47 and 55 dollars each. At the highest price, this would value the company at 26 billion dollars. According to Bloomberg, the company had originally aimed for a capital injection of 4 billion dollars at a valuation of 35 billion dollars. Despite this downward adjustment, the IPO has already been oversubscribed: there is more demand for shares than supply.\n\nImpressive infrastructure\n\nThe cloud provider manages more than 250,000 Nvidia graphics cards in 32 data centers worldwide. CoreWeave is one of the few providers that supply the Blackwell B200, Nvidia\u2019s newest and most powerful AI accelerator. It also offers workstation-grade Nvidia cards optimized for rendering tasks.\n\nThe company claims that its platform delivers better performance for AI workloads than the large public clouds. According to the IPO application, Llama 3.1 can be trained on the CoreWeave platform with 3.1 million fewer GPU hours than with an unnamed competitor. The company also promises to significantly speed up LLMs loading on Nvidia chips.\n\nProprietary software innovations\n\nCoreWeave has developed several proprietary software tools for its platform. One of these, SUNK, is designed to help companies make their cloud-based AI environments more efficient.\n\nCompanies often use Kubernetes for their inference workloads and another open-source tool, Slurm, for AI training. These two tools usually have to be deployed on separate server clusters. SUNK makes it possible to run Slurm on Kubernetes, eliminating customers needing to maintain two separate server clusters.\n\nImpressive customer base\n\nCoreWeave\u2019s functionality has helped the company to close deals with several large tech companies. Its customers include OpenAI, Meta, IBM and Microsoft. Last year, Microsoft accounted for 62 percent of the 1.9 billion dollars in revenue that CoreWeave generated.\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT, the company has experienced explosive sales growth. Sales increased by 737 percent in 2024 and even 1,346 percent (!) the year before. CoreWeave is investing heavily to maintain this growth: the loss widened from 594 million dollars in 2023 to 594 million dollars last year.\n\nFuture plans\n\nIn its IPO application, CoreWeave indicates that it intends to maintain revenue growth by expanding its international presence. The company also plans to launch industry-specific solutions for sectors such as banking, where it expects increasing demand for AI. \u201cAlthough it is still early days, we are already seeing strong interest from these industries,\u201d the application states.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan to improve its financial performance could also include changes to its data center strategy. CoreWeave currently leases most of its cloud facilities. The IPO application states that it \u201cmay make investments\u201d to take more ownership interests in its data centers. It hopes that \u201cthis will give us more control and responsibility over the delivery time of new construction projects, and give us more control over our data center costs.\u201d Reducing infrastructure costs could help the company move closer to profitability.\n\nCoreWeave will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol CRWV.\n\nAlso read: A storm has formed around CoreWeave",

            "content": "Open this photo in gallery: Spanish soccer club Sevilla FC now uses an AI tool to help process the thousands of reports it receives from scouts around the world.CRISTINA QUICLER/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSevilla FC has a new tool in its recruitment tool belt.\n\nThe Spanish soccer club \u2013 like most major sports franchises \u2013 typically dedicates teams to pore over scouting reports to help make player decisions. In 2023, Sevilla FC began working with IBM to develop an AI-based app that could analyze 300,000 scouting reports and in minutes offer recruiters answers to questions that used to require hundreds of man-hours.\n\nThe end result? Scout Advisor, which went live last year.\n\n\u201cSevilla FC had a long-term reputation of being this amazing football club for scouting,\u201d says Dave McCann, former president of IBM Canada and now managing partner of IBM Consulting Europe, Middle East and Africa. \u201cThis allows them to leverage their existing recruiters but make them far more efficient by using generative AI technology, natural language processing, and essentially digesting all this unstructured data to totally change the game with how they evaluate players.\u201d\n\nMcCann emphasizes the technology does not replace human scouts, who have long been part of the team\u2019s success, but rather empowers them to make better use of reports and data they collect.\n\n\u201cSevilla FC knows exactly what sort of players they want to scout and recruit, and they don\u2019t talk publicly about what those attributes are because that\u2019s their secret sauce,\u201d he says. \u201cThis solution has also taken a ton of bias out of the recruiting process because they apply the same standards to the thousands of players they\u2019re looking at.\u201d\n\nSevilla FC may be one of the earliest adopters, but McCann says it won\u2019t be long before the same tools are used by professional teams in the Ottawa native\u2019s home country.\n\n\u201cThe pace of generative AI and technology adoption in sporting clubs is accelerating significantly, and I think we\u2019ll see that acceleration continue faster in the next 12 to 18 months. It\u2019s definitely fair to say that we\u2019re going to start seeing this become much more common in the next season or two.\u201d\n\nProfessional sports teams invest significant resources in selecting their rosters, and new technologies such as gen AI promise an edge when it comes to evaluating player potential.\n\n\u201cIn terms of recruitment and scouting, there\u2019s indication that the teams want to go in that direction and are interested in having tools to help them do that,\u201d says John Zelek, a systems design engineering professor and co-director of the Vision and Image Processing (VIP) Lab at the University of Waterloo. \u201cWe have a project with the Baltimore Orioles, and they\u2019ve been telling us as well that they would like to have more tools so they can better scout players.\u201d\n\nOne of the key challenges professional sports leagues face on this side of the world, Zelek says, is the relatively minimal use of technology in the minor leagues, which often leaves recruiters with insufficient data to draw from.\n\n\u201cThey have lots of stats in terms of how many goals or assists for hockey, or batting average for baseball, but not to the extent of the data that they\u2019re collecting at the (highest) professional level.\u201d\n\nBuilding that database requires scouts to regularly attend games around the world and log the data manually or pore through hours of game tape to isolate a single player, even in arenas that have automated video capturing technology.\n\n\u201cIdentifying a unique player in the course of a hockey game through a single camera is very difficult \u2013 it is an unsolved problem,\u201d says University of Waterloo systems design engineering professor and co-director of VIP Lab, David Clausi. \u201cFollowing a player through a hockey game, through their substitutions, knowing when they come on the ice and when they leave the ice, that doesn\u2019t exist through video.\u201d\n\nClausi adds that such capabilities are available using multiple cameras, sensors, and other technologies widely used in professional leagues, but not at the junior level. At least not yet.\n\nThe other major challenge professional teams will need to contend with before AI can play a bigger role in recruitment is that most don\u2019t know which attributes best determine a player\u2019s likelihood of future success.\n\nMany of the most successful players are drafted in the first or second rounds, but many future stars are not, suggesting even the best recruiters don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re looking for. That, Clausi suggests, may prove to be the most significant opportunity for recruiters that results from the AI revolution, though it will take time.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be an evolution with regards to the metrics themselves, and the evaluative methods,\u201d Clausi says. \u201cIf you had a pool of video from the past half dozen years that you could work with to establish metrics, then you could see how those metrics correlate with success in the NHL. That\u2019s the only way you validate the nature of your algorithms.\u201d",

            "content": "Whilst AI can feel very futuristic, its roots are more historical than you might expect. IBM\u2019s research into artificial intelligence goes back to the 1950s, and Jonathan Adashek, senior vice president, marketing and communications, sees this latest wave of innovation as a transformative moment in time.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI has really proven to be a game changer \u2013 it's like the Netscape moment, where people really embraced the internet,\u201d he tells LBB.\n\nOne of the biggest and most celebrated uses of AI in marketing is its ability to personalise content, but Jonathan says he \u201cdisagrees completely\u201d with the idea that is what the technology should be used for.\n\n\u201cContent with AI needs to be personalised, and it must be relevant \u2013 because if it's not relevant, people don't pay attention to it.\n\n\u201cWe've all gotten that personalised letter in the mail that makes you wonder why you got it. You have no desire to go on this vacation, to adopt a penguin, or do whatever it says to. We get rid of it. It's not relevant. So, we've got to make sure that we're delivering personalised and relevant content to people.\"\n\nCreativity is increasingly influenced by AI, but Jonathan says \u201cAI's role in creativity is huge,\u201d and the tech is \u201cnot replacing creativity, but enhancing it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he points to IBM's campaign for The Masters in 2023 as an example of leveraging the tech to make the most of a creative idea.\n\n\u201cWhen Firefly first came out, I went to Adobe and asked, 'Can we use this to create an ad for The Masters, even though it's in beta?\u2019 They had just introduced it at their Summit. They said, 'Okay', and in a matter of minutes, we had 2,000 selects. What we chose for a digital ad had 26 times the engagement. It was our highest performing digital ad of the year, and it was created with Firefly AI.\u201d\n\nThis, he says, is the true potential of AI for creatives. \u201cThey can be more creative. They can actually be practitioners of what they're experts in.\u201d\n\nFor brands embracing the trend of returning to craft (think +61\u2019s dominos or stop-motion puppets, or Leo Australia\u2019s Bundy Bear), Jonathan argues AI still has a role to play. \u201cIt\u2019s going to augment what people are doing, it\u2019s going to enable people to be more creative -- it's not going to replace people.\u201d\n\nInstead, he says the real risk lies in avoiding AI altogether. \u201cWhere people are going to get replaced is when they're not using AI, and their neighbour in the office is using it. They're going to lose out to the person who can be more effective, more efficient, more creative because they've got that set of tools that are helping them.\u201d\n\nBeyond content creation, AI presents an opportunity to refine business strategies. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge, huge opportunity in using AI to make our journey more effective, more seamless, and more engaging for people along the way \u2013 whether you\u2019re the person doing the work or you're creating content to provide to your clients.\u201d\n\nAnd if you can be more creative, faster, and more efficient? Well, that\u2019s just good for business.\n\n\u201cPeople have to look past the creative and the content, and look at how it can impact the rest of your business in the marketing space. Say you\u2019ve got $100, how do you spend $100 in a way that is going to bring me the most return? That is where people have to start looking now.\"\n\nJonathan dismisses the idea that hesitancy to adopt AI is due to fatigue in the topic as a whole. \u201cI think the bigger thing is that people are hesitant to use it because they're not sure how to get started. It's not that they're resistant, they're trying to figure out how to begin, how do I do something meaningful here?\u201d\n\nIBM was founded in 1911, and ethics have \u201cbeen at the foundation of our company since the very beginning,\u201d Jonathan says.\n\n\u201cWe're a 113-year-old company, and when you have that age, you develop some principles that go with it that make you who you are. We've not strayed away from those, and that has helped us.\n\n\u201cTrust was the foundation on which IBM was built from the beginning, so we've had an AI ethics board for many, many years that looks at the applications of AI. We've got a governance which helps manage the various confluence of models, making sure that we're meeting regulations properly.\"\n\n",

The IBM Classic Cloud IaaS portfolio, among others, may lose a quarter of its total workforce.\n\nBig Blue is once again cutting back on its activities and will be laying off many employees, The Register reports based on sources. Although the exact number of layoffs is not yet known, it is said to be in the thousands.\n\nThis group would have to report to an IBM office at least three times a week by the end of April of this year. According to the sources speaking to The Register, the affected employees would be strictly monitored by their managers.\n\nIBM layoffs\n\nIt is not known whether this really is a new round of layoffs or whether the teams working on older products are being downsized. It is also possible that the potential new layoffs are part of recent rounds of layoffs that Big Blue is carrying out as part of its Resource Actions (layoff) processes through Return-to-Office measures and internal Co-Location requirements.\n\nThe layoffs are said to affect the Raleigh, North Carolina, New York City and State, Dallas, Texas and California locations.\n\nClassic Cloud portfolio hit hard\n\nAccording to sources, the layoffs would now also affect the company\u2019s Classic Cloud IaaS portfolio. This portfolio, which builds on that of the acquired SoftLayer, would be a target for staff reductions at IBM. Approximately 10 percent of the workforce would be sent packing.\n\nTeams within this portfolio that are likely to be affected are involved in consulting, cloud infrastructure offerings and sales activities, among other things.\n\nAt the higher corporate level, teams that deal with social responsibility and employees who report to the IBM CIO and work on internal systems would be affected.\n\nThe activities of IBM\u2019s Classic Cloud would also be transferred en masse to India.\n\nLegacy products under attack\n\nIBM seems to be planning to make more cuts to its legacy product workforce. During its annual investor day, it recently announced that it will no longer publish the results of its Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Security products and services. This means that employees in these areas can also expect layoffs in the near future.\n\nLast week, layoffs were announced for Big Blue\u2019s marketing and communications department.\n\nAlso read: British government approves IBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp",

IBM watsonx.governance will allow enterprises to monitor and govern NIM microservices across any hosting environment.\n\nAI-focused IBM Consulting capabilities, with Nvidia providing AI integration services via Nvidia Blueprints, optimizing compute-intensive AI workloads across hybrid cloud environments using Red Hat OpenShift and Nvidia AI.\n\nNvidia H200 GPU instance availability on IBM Cloud.\n\nStorage Scale support for Nvidia\u2019s AI Data Platform reference design.\n\nVincent Hsu\n\nIBM Fellow, VP, and CTO Vincent Hsu wrote about CAS, saying it is based on work by IBM Research and Nvidia. Because IBM now has \u201cembedded compute, data pipelines, and vector database capabilities within the storage system, CAS reduces data movement and latency to increase efficiency.\u201d\n\nStorage Scale can obtain data from many sources. It has \u201cglobal data abstraction services engineered to provide connectivity from multiple data sources and multiple locations to bring data into your AI factory from IBM and third-party storage environments.\u201d\n\nCAS can, using AI-Q and NeMo Retriever, \u201cextract information from text, charts, graphs and even images.\u201d It is able to \u201cwatch folders on other storage systems or in the cloud to identify changes as they occur, automatically run pre-built pipelines, and update just the changes to the vector database, ensuring that data is current for AI applications efficiently using Nvidia accelerated computing.\u201d\n\nIBM Storage Scale will respond to queries using extracted and augmented data, accelerating communications between GPUs and storage via BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-X networking.\n\nCAS can detect changes in multiple unstructured data stores, convert the modified data into vectors, and feed it to AI models to improve RAG responses to user or AI assistant requests. Or as Hsu put it: \u201dBy applying innovative natural language processing techniques, we\u2019ve developed ways to much more efficiently extract the semantic meaning from all kinds of content, making it easier to update AI tools to improve the quality of their answers.\u201d\n\nNvidia Storage Networking Technology VP Rob Davis said: \u201cAI agents need to rapidly access, fetch and process data at scale, and today, these steps occur in separate silos. The integration of IBM\u2019s content-aware storage with Nvidia AI orchestrates data and compute across an optimized network fabric to overcome silos with an intelligent, scalable system that drives near real-time inference for responsive AI reasoning.\u201d\n\nStorage Scale content-awareness facilities will be embedded in the next update of IBM Fusion generally available in the second quarter. Interested parties can learn more by registering here for the webinar \u201cAI First Storage \u2013 Enhancing AI Results with Content-Aware Storage,\u201d scheduled for April 8, 2025, at 1100 Eastern Time.",

This drop follows the announcement by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that certain government consulting contracts would be canceled, affecting consulting stocks.\n\nCurrently, IBM (IBM, Financial) is trading at $243.32. Despite the recent drop, the stock remains close to its 52-week high of $266.45, indicating strong market performance over the past year. The company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 37.96, which is relatively high, suggesting that the market may have priced in strong future growth expectations.\n\nAccording to the GF Value evaluation, IBM is considered \"Significantly Overvalued\" with a GF Value estimate of $148.19. This highlights a potential overvaluation in the market compared to its intrinsic value.\n\nIBM's financial health shows a mixed scenario. While the operating margin is expanding, yielding a favorable sign for profitability, the company's revenue growth has slowed, and its dividend yield is close to a 10-year low. However, a strong Altman Z-score of 3.47 reflects solid financial stability.\n\nWith insider buying activities registered, albeit minimal, and a robust roster of business partners including 95% of Fortune 500 companies, IBM continues to maintain a diversified business model. The company's consistent dividend track record since 1994 remains an attractive feature for income-seeking investors.\n\nInvestors should remain cautious of IBM's valuation while considering the current market conditions and the potential impacts of government contract cancellations on the consulting sector. Continuous monitoring of the stock valuation and strategic assessment of its business operations are recommended for potential investors in IBM (IBM, Financial).",

At NVIDIA\u2019s GTC 2025, the session \u201cAI Promise to Profits: Maximize Business ROI with Accelerated Computing\u201d (Session S74483) shared some solid insights on how businesses can tap into the potential of AI using hybrid cloud architecture and better infrastructure. Hillery Hunter, CTO of IBM Infrastructure, Briana Frank, VP of IBM Cloud PaaS and Platform Product Management and Design, and Chandra Ravi, Senior Director of Distributed Systems Engineering at Visa, led the discussion. They talked about how businesses can boost ROI by improving efficiency, managing data better, and keeping things secure with good governance. Key points included making the most of GPU resources, weighing the pros and cons of open-source vs. proprietary AI models, and dealing with AI ethics. The session also looked at how AI is making an impact in areas like customer support and HR, with a focus on saving costs and speeding up AI adoption while keeping everything compliant and secure.\n\nKeys to Business Outcomes with AI\n\nFor AI to make a real impact on business results, companies need to create a hybrid platform that strikes the right balance between flexibility and customization. When choosing AI models, businesses face a choice between open-source models, which allow more flexibility, and proprietary models, which are fine-tuned for specific tasks. But often, smaller, more specialized models can actually deliver better results than large, general models, providing more precise outcomes.\n\nThe real power of AI comes in how it\u2019s customized. Companies need to integrate their data into AI frameworks while ensuring proper governance. This helps keep models accurate, reduces bias, and ensures everything aligns with the company\u2019s goals. Without solid governance, AI projects can suffer from inefficiency, inaccuracies, or even security risks.\n\nInfrastructure\u2019s Role in Realizing AI Outcomes\n\nFor AI to work well at scale, scalability is key. To get the best performance, making good use of GPUs is essential. Creating a direct link between GPU memory and storage can speed up the process of training AI models, helping businesses get better results faster.\n\nManaging large datasets is also crucial. Known as data fusion, this process allows businesses to handle both structured and unstructured data more effectively. AI solutions need to be able to process and analyze these different kinds of data to draw meaningful insights. A flexible infrastructure makes it easier to use AI across various IT setups.\n\nThe Benefits of a Hybrid Cloud Approach\n\nHybrid cloud solutions provide businesses with the flexibility they need while keeping security and data sovereignty in check. Since AI often works with sensitive data, it\u2019s important to manage where and how that data is stored. Hybrid cloud frameworks offer a good balance between performance and compliance, making it easier and safer to adopt AI.\n\nUsing a hybrid cloud approach can speed up AI productivity, lower operational costs, and still maintain strong performance. Tools like OpenShift AI and RHEL AI create a solid foundation for deploying AI solutions across different environments. This means companies can deploy AI models at scale without sacrificing security or performance.\n\nRed Hat AI InstructLab: Simplifying AI for Enterprises\n\nRed Hat AI InstructLab helps align large language models (LLMs) with the specific needs of businesses. Adopting AI can be tricky, especially when it comes to security and the risk of \u201ccatastrophic forgetting,\u201d where models lose what they\u2019ve learned over time. InstructLab helps by ensuring businesses have full control over their data and models, addressing these risks.\n\nAs a service, InstructLab ensures security, availability, and continuous updates, making it easier to train and deploy AI models. This allows companies to scale AI securely and efficiently.\n\nA Practical Use Case: AI for Marathon Running Performance\n\nTo show what InstructLab can do, a practical experiment was done focusing on marathon running performance. The study explored how LLMs could grasp specialized terms related to running, shoes, and individual training data. The AI model was trained with running-related terminology, generating synthetic data to personalize its recommendations. For instance, it could suggest the best shoes for tempo runs based on a person\u2019s performance, demonstrating how AI can go beyond generic answers to provide tailored advice.\n\nModel Alignment: The Key to Personalized AI\n\nThe process of model alignment separates basic AI models from more specialized ones. General AI models provide broad, generic answers, while aligned models offer specific, context-aware responses. For example, an aligned model could recommend running shoes based on a runner\u2019s performance, whereas a general model would just list all available options.\n\nSynthetic Data Generation (SDG) plays an important role in this. By generating and validating training examples, SDG helps refine the AI model\u2019s understanding of specific areas. This allows businesses to fine-tune their AI even when real-world data is scarce or difficult to gather.\n\nIBM Consulting: Helping Businesses Navigate AI Adoption\n\nAs AI continues to change industries, many businesses look to consulting services for help with integrating AI into their operations. AI adoption comes with challenges, like workforce training, strategy development, and deployment. Many companies turn to experts for advice on how to tackle these challenges and make the most out of AI.\n\nConsulting services offer support from strategy development to governance management and model deployment. As AI projects keep growing, the need for expert guidance in these areas will only increase.\n\nLooking Ahead: AI Innovations and Future Plans\n\nThere are plenty of exciting AI innovations lined up for future events, aimed at helping businesses drive AI-powered transformation. These advancements are focused on scaling infrastructure, adopting hybrid cloud architectures, and fine-tuning model alignment to achieve real business results.\n\nResearch and development efforts in AI will continue pushing boundaries, ensuring that AI keeps evolving and making an impact across industries.\n\nAI as a Business Accelerator\n\nThe right mix of hybrid cloud solutions, scalable infrastructure, and model alignment is key to unlocking AI\u2019s full potential. These technologies let businesses use AI effectively while keeping data secure and under control.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, companies that strategically implement these technologies will be in a stronger position to innovate and improve business outcomes. By focusing on AI\u2019s technical strengths and aligning it with their specific needs, businesses can harness its transformative power to improve their operations.\n\nAuthor Bernice Lottering",

            "content": "Market Overview\n\nThe stock market closed with losses across the board. Major indices ended the session with declines ranging from 0.6% to 1.7%. Despite the downturn, gains from the previous two sessions for the S&P 500 (-1.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (-1.7%) have not been fully erased. Currently, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are still up by 1.7% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to Thursday's close.\n\nMega Cap Stocks Performance\n\nTesla (TSLA, Financial): $225.31, down $12.70, or 5.3%\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA, Financial): $115.52, down $4.00, or 3.4%\n\nMeta Platforms (META): $582.36, down $22.54, or 3.7%\n\nAlphabet (GOOG): $162.67, down $3.90, or 2.3%\n\nInvestors were digesting headlines related to NVIDIA amid its GTC event, but the news had little impact on its shares. Meanwhile, Alphabet announced a $32 billion cash acquisition of Wiz, Inc., a cloud security platform company.\n\nGeopolitical Factors\n\nGeopolitical tensions contributed to today's market downturn, though commodities and Treasuries did not reflect this unrest. Treasuries, typically a safe haven during such times, saw the 10-year yield drop three basis points to 4.28%, and the 2-year yield drop one basis point to 4.04%. Oil prices, which often rise with Middle East tensions due to supply concerns, saw WTI crude oil futures fall 1.2% to $66.78 per barrel.\n\nPresident Trump's call with Russian President Putin received a muted response from stocks and bonds. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the leaders agreed on a ceasefire and peace negotiations.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nToday's economic data was mixed. February housing starts increased to 1.501 million, surpassing the consensus of 1.385 million, with a notable 18.3% rise in the South region. Building permits were at 1.456 million, slightly above the consensus of 1.450 million.\n\nFebruary export prices rose 0.1%, and import prices increased 0.4%. Industrial production saw a 0.7% increase, with a significant 8.5% jump in motor vehicles and parts, likely due to tariff frontrunning. Motor vehicle assemblies rose 11.5% month-over-month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.35 million.\n\nUpcoming Data\n\n7:00 ET: Weekly MBA Mortgage Index (prior 11.2%)\n\n10:30 ET: Weekly crude oil inventories (prior +1.45 million)\n\n16:00 ET: January Net Long-Term TIC Flows (prior $72.0 billion)\n\nMarch FOMC decision at 2:00 ET\n\nInternational Markets\n\nEuropean markets showed gains with the DAX up 1.0%, FTSE up 0.3%, and CAC up 0.5%. In Asia, the Nikkei rose 1.2%, Hang Seng increased 2.5%, and Shanghai inched up 0.1%.\n\nGuru Stock Picks\n\nCarl Icahn has made the following transactions:\n\nAdd in CVI by 0.13%\n\nToday's News\n\nIBM (IBM, Financial) announced new collaborations with NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial) to enhance its AI capabilities, planning integrations based on NVIDIA's AI Data Platform. This partnership aims to scale generative AI workloads and introduce new consulting capabilities, leveraging open technologies for improved data management and security. In response, NVIDIA shares saw a slight increase of 0.12% in after-hours trading, while IBM shares rose by 0.10%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, Financial) made headlines with its all-cash $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity startup Wiz, marking its largest acquisition to date. The deal is set to bolster Google Cloud's security offerings, with Wiz continuing to operate across major cloud platforms. Following the announcement, shares of cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) saw minor declines, while Alphabet shares increased slightly in premarket trading.\n\nNvidia (NVDA, Financial) CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI at the company's GTC event, emphasizing the need for increased computing power with the rise of agentic AI. Despite the positive outlook, Nvidia shares dropped 3% amid broader market declines in semiconductor stocks, including AMD (AMD) and Micron Technology (MU).\n\nBYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF) introduced its Super e-Platform, enabling electric vehicles to charge at speeds comparable to gasoline refueling, providing up to 400 kilometers of range in just five minutes. This innovation aims to alleviate range anxiety and strengthen BYD's position in the EV market.\n\nRegenxbio (RGNX, Financial) surged ~11% after Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT, Financial) disclosed a mortality linked to its gene therapy product. This development could accelerate the enrollment for Regenxbio's AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial, potentially leading to an accelerated approval for its DMD candidate.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) regained its position as the most shorted S&P 500 stock, with short interest rising to 21.34% of its shares. Despite recent volatility, SMCI's shares have risen significantly this year, making it one of the top performers in the index.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM, Financial) saw its stock slump after Walmart (WMT) announced Klarna as its exclusive provider for installment loans, impacting Affirm's integration volumes. However, analysts suggest the decline is overdone, with potential for Affirm to recoup losses through other offerings.\n\nPfizer (PFE) is planning to sell its remaining 7.3% stake in Haleon (HLN, Financial), continuing its divestment from the consumer healthcare company it co-founded with GSK. This move follows Pfizer's previous sale of shares in January.\n\nMedtronic (MDT, Financial) faced a serious product recall by the FDA for its Pipeline Vantage 027 embolization devices, used to treat intracranial aneurysms. The recall was prompted by reports of device failures leading to serious health risks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) shares fell 4% despite announcing that its Llama AI models have surpassed 1 billion downloads.

            "content": "The future of Google's parent company's looks murkier than ever.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG -0.63%) (GOOGL -0.72%) is often considered a reliable blue chip tech stock. It owns Google, the world's most widely used search engine; Android, the largest mobile operating system; Chrome, which dominates the web browser market; and YouTube, the top streaming video platform with over 2.7 billion monthly active users. It also provides a broad range of market-leading cloud-based productivity and infrastructure services.\n\nOver the past decade, Alphabet's stock rallied nearly 480% as its digital advertising and cloud businesses expanded. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% as its EPS increased at a CAGR of 23%.\n\nBut today, Alphabet's core advertising business, which generated 76% of its revenue in 2024, faces three existential challenges. First, generative artificial (AI) platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT are changing how people search for information. Second, short video platforms like ByteDance's TikTok and Meta Platforms' Reels are pulling advertisers and viewers away from YouTube's longer-format videos. Lastly, U.S. antitrust regulators are pressing Alphabet to sell Chrome or Android.\n\nSome investors might be wondering if Alphabet is doomed to become the next IBM, which lost the PC and enterprise software markets to its nimbler competitors over the past four decades. But is that a fair comparison, or is it just a bearish hyperbole which overlooks the actual differences between Alphabet and IBM?\n\nIBM's biggest mistakes\n\nIBM dominated the personal computing market in the 1980s and early 1990s, but it didn't actually own the IP to any of the off-the-shelf components in its PCs. As a result, other PC makers produced cheaper \"IBM PC clones\" with the same hardware. IBM tried to differentiate itself from those clones with its own operating system, OS/2, but that effort flopped as Microsoft Windows became the dominant OS for IBM PC clones.\n\nThose failures forced IBM to back away from the PC market, and it eventually sold its ThinkPad PC business to Lenovo in 2005. It also sold its server business to Lenovo in 2014. That retreat shows how a company's core growth engine can wither if its moat dries up and it fails to keep up with its nimbler competitors.\n\nBy the late 2000s and early 2010s, IBM was struggling to expand its aging enterprise software and IT services divisions against cloud-based competitors like Microsoft and Amazon, and Google. But instead of aggressively investing in new cloud services and transforming its on-premise software and services into cloud-based ones, IBM focused on divesting its weaker units, cutting costs, and buying back more shares to boost its EPS.\n\nBy the time IBM tried to expand its cloud business by acquiring SoftLayer in 2013, it had already far fallen behind Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Its fortunes didn't improve until 2020, when its cloud chief Arvind Krishna took the helm as its new CEO, divested its struggling infrastructure services business, and leveraged its acquisition of RedHat (in 2019) to expand its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses.\n\nIs Alphabet headed down the same road?\n\nThe bears expect Alphabet to face the same fate as IBM as generative AI platforms intercept more search queries and reduce the effectiveness of its search engine and targeted ads. Google is trying to catch up with its own generative AI platform, Gemini, but it could still end up as the OS/2 of the AI market if it falls behind ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot.\n\nMoreover, Android is still an open-source OS which can be modified by anyone. That makes it easy for companies like Amazon to launch their own forked versions of Android (Fire OS) and build their own app-driven ecosystems. Google's cloud platform business is still growing, but it ranks a distant third in the cloud race behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube -- which drives a lot of its advertising growth -- doesn't have a meaningful moat against TikTok or Reels. Its top creators can easily cross-post their content to those rival platforms, and they'll likely shuffle toward the one which gives them the biggest cut of their ad revenues. YouTube is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its subscriptions business, but that strategic shift strongly suggests the growth of its advertising business will cool off over the next few years.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) could further erode Google's defenses by forcing it to sell Chrome, which gathers data from its users for its core advertising business; and Android, which locks 2.5 billion users into its Google-powered apps.\n\nLike the old IBM, Alphabet is trying to offset that pressure by pruning its workforce, cutting costs, and buying back 11% of its shares over the past five years. However, its future could remain murky if it fails to keep pace with the shift toward AI services.\n\nAlphabet isn't becoming the old IBM (yet)\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss Alphabet as the next IBM, but it's still growing a lot faster than Big Blue. Its expansion efforts have been undeniably clumsy, but they could still bear fruit over the next few years. I'd keep a close eye on its recent challenges, but I wouldn't rule out a surprising comeback once it finally gets its act together.",

(WBNG) -- According to the project\u2019s construction company, Endicott\u2019s IBM demolitions are more than halfway done.\n\nThe President of Gorick Construction, Alfred Gorick Jr., told 12 News that IBM demolitions have been in the works for years. It wasn\u2019t until last year that the property owners decided to complete the demolition after receiving grant funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our eightieth year in business here, and it\u2019s nice to be able to support the local economy and support the local drive to clean up light in the area and present new opportunities for development,\u201d Gorick Jr. stated.\n\nGorick Construction said there are minimal, if any, safety hazards to the public. Its employees wear respirators, and the hydraulic equipment is used to avoid implosions. The entire demolition site is also fenced off.\n\nThe construction company\u2019s main concern is squatters, but there is a check each day.\n\n\u201cWith buildings that big, inherently there could be squatters in there, so every day we certainly go through the building, make sure nobody\u2019s still in there,\u201d Gormick Jr. added. \u201cWe have the police who\u2019ve worked with us too; Endicott police have been great working with us, trying to make sure people aren\u2019t in there to be in harm\u2019s danger.\u201d\n\nThe construction company also said they\u2019re trying to make the project as green as possible. Since the buildings are condemned, Gorick Jr. said it\u2019s slightly more complicated. However, they recycle as many materials as possible.\n\nConstruction is anticipated to be finished around the end of May.\n\nCopyright 2025 WBNG. All rights reserved.",

Thanks to software solutions like IBM Sterling Order Management, many organizations are already seeing the benefits of operationalizing technology in the form of simplified and more efficient operations.\n\nMeeting Customer Demand Thanks to Revolutionary Inventory Visibility\n\nIn any given calendar year, customer\u2019s priorities are constantly evolving. Therefore, it can be difficult for retailers to predict buying patterns and accurately prepare to fulfill their orders. Take Advance Auto Parts (AAP), for example. They manage a catalog of 2 million unique parts at any given time. With the capacity to stock fewer than 20,000 SKUs at each store, AAP faced challenges in efficiently fulfilling customer orders.\n\nTo improve customer order fulfilment, AAP leveraged OneRail and IBM\u2019s solutions, helping them gain visibility into inventory across multiple locations, and enabling dynamic selection of inventory in real-time.\n\n\"Partnering with another company that's customer-centric is really important. IBM and OneRail sit shoulder to shoulder with you to figure out how to best serve your customer,\u201d said Advance Auto Parts EVP & CFO Ryan Grimsland.\n\nBy implementing this technology, AAP improved their ability to meet demand with precision while reducing inefficiencies. The result was a 98% on-time delivery rate, a 12% reduction in transportation costs, and a 27% sales increase for their 30-minute delivery segment.\n\nImproving omni channel Order Fulfillment\n\nWhen it comes to fulfilling customer orders, coordinating efforts across different channels and locations can also be difficult. This was the case for Tiendas Del Sol \u2013 Woolworth, the Mexican retail with stores across 70+ cities in the country. As the company navigates evolving consumer demands, they sought tools to help adapt their service accordingly. In turn, they decided to leverage IBM Sterling Order Management and Perfaware\u2019s technology to optimize their order processing capacity with more agile and accurate inventory management.\n\n\u201cOur customers are our reason for being, so we are leveraging our operation to deliver a better experience with Del Sol - Woolworth,\u201d said Rommel Flores, E-commerce Deputy Director at Del Sol - Woolworth. \u201cAnd through this technology, we can now provide customers with seamless integration between digital and physical channels, delivering greater accuracy in product availability and facilitating processes such as returns.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Del Sol- Woolworth used the tools to modernize their operations in the areas of omnichannel, after-sales and logistics. When it comes to omnichannel order fulfillment, they managed to use IBM\u2019s technology to gather timely data around out of stock products. This resulted in a significant reduction in orders cancelled due to out of stock merchandise going from 10% to less than 1%.\n\nEmbedding Innovative AI capabilities to Empower Customer Service Representatives\n\nFor many retailers, call centers are crucial for their operations. However, it can be difficult for Customer Service Representatives (CSR) to balance providing fast and personalized service. To help our clients overcome this challenge, IBM recently released a new AI-infused IBM Sterling Next Generation Call Center solution as part of IBM Sterling Order Management System (OMS) to support CSRs. The solution plugs into IBM watsonx.ai, our AI development studio, allowing businesses to equip an AI assistant with a comprehensive knowledge base that will help CSRs automate certain manual processes such as applying a coupon retroactively to a customers\u2019 order or summarizing their interaction history, and can lead to more timely issue resolution.\n\nAdopting generative AI (Gen AI) in this manner can empower organizations with the tools they need to enhance both customer and CSR experiences, streamline operations, maintain cost efficiency, and more.\n\nSupporting Retailers in 2025 and Beyond\n\nAs the retail industry continues to evolve this new year, so will customer needs and the strategies businesses must take to fulfill them. At IBM, we are looking forward to continue finding innovative ways for technology solutions, like IBM Sterling, to aid retailers in this ever-changing journey.\n\nLooking for the next step?

Backed by the Saudi government, Riyadh Air expects its first flight to take off in 2025, and aims to connect passengers to over 100 destinations around the world by 2030. Its inaugural flight is planned for late 2025.\n\nIBM and its consulting subsidiary, IBM Consulting, were quickly onboarded as its lead digital partner, and over the course of their collaboration to date, the partnership was expanded into other areas such as customer experience and travel experience.\n\nThe latest scope added into the agreement will see IBM help Riyadh Air embed AI within its decision-making and operations, supporting its ambition to become a truly digital-native airline.\n\n\u201cOur vision is to deliver a seamless, world-class travel experience.

            "content": "Melinda French Gates, one of America\u2019s richest women, owes much of her success to a pivotal piece of advice she received early on. At the start of her career, she was offered a job at IBM, only to be urged by her hiring manager to turn it down in favor of a tiny startup in Seattle\u2014Microsoft.\n\nA life-changing decision\n\nIn a candid interview, French Gates recalled how a female hiring manager at IBM suggested she reject their offer and pursue an opportunity at a small company, Microsoft.\n\nAt the time, Microsoft was just starting to gain traction, and the idea of leaving a stable job offer for an unknown company seemed like a huge risk. Yet, French Gates followed the advice, and the rest is history.\n\nThe decision was not an easy one. At the time, IBM was one of the most powerful companies in the world, and leaving such an established organization was a difficult prospect.\n\nBut the IBM hiring manager, who was clearly looking out for French Gates\u2019 long-term success, encouraged her to take a leap of faith, even though it was against IBM\u2019s own interests.\n\n\u201cIf they give you an offer, you should take it,\u201d the hiring manager said. French Gates was taken aback by this advice, but she took it to heart and followed through.\n\nThe journey to success at Microsoft\n\nFrench Gates joined Microsoft, where she quickly rose through the ranks over a nine-year period. She played a key role in the company\u2019s development, becoming the general manager of information products at the tech giant.\n\nDuring her time at Microsoft, she helped the company transition from a small business into one of the most influential companies in the world. Her contributions were integral to Microsoft\u2019s growth, and she became a significant player in the company\u2019s success.\n\nIn reflecting on her career at Microsoft, French Gates recognizes that taking a chance on the company, despite its small size and uncertainty at the time, was a major turning point in her life.\n\nNow worth $15.2 billion, French Gates is not only one of the richest women in America but also a powerful figure in both the tech world and philanthropy.\n\nThe value of taking risks\n\nFor French Gates, the decision to leave IBM and take a chance on a growing company was not easy. It meant uprooting her life and moving to the West Coast, where she didn\u2019t know anyone and had no guarantees of success. But what made it worth the risk was the excitement of joining a company that was pioneering in a way that few others were.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing,\u201d she said, recalling the moment she made the decision. \u201cI was like, \u2018I want to be part of that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis decision, though risky, ultimately paid off in ways she could never have imagined. From a promising start at a small company to becoming a critical part of a global tech leader, French Gates\u2019 story illustrates the value of taking bold steps in your career, even when the future seems uncertain.\n\nThe advice that women need to hear\n\nToday, French Gates encourages others, particularly women, to embrace career pivots and take risks. She frequently reminds women that the path to success is not always straightforward.\n\n\u201cYou can pivot careers. You can change. You can go over here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this.\u201d\n\nFrench Gates\u2019 advice is particularly powerful for women, who often face different challenges and barriers in male-dominated industries. By taking that first step into the unknown, women can achieve remarkable success, just as French Gates did.",

She is survived by her mother, Beverly, her brothers Greg (Kelly) and Steve (Wendy) and nieces and nephews: Lauren, Zach, Nicole, Jack, Kate, Emily, Mitch and Sam. She was preceded in death by her beloved father, Howard J.

She attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she earned two master's degrees. Teaching was her passion, and she taught in the history department at UW. She continued her life-long love of learning until her passing.\n\n\n\nAndrea was diagnosed with IBM, a debilitating muscle disease that affected her entire body, but more primarily her respiratory system and her mobility. She depended upon tube feedings and a ventilator to assist her in staying alive. She entered home hospice in December 2024 and we are very grateful for Park Nicollet hospice. We are also very grateful to Pastor Jeff Lindsay for his many visits and to dear care givers, Tommie, Erin and Gina. Special thanks to Erin for her wonderful care. She dearly loved each of them. Also, thanks to her many Bethel friends and friends from Intervarsity Christian Fellowship at UW. Many of them were with her that final week. She was so grateful for their friendship.\n\n\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held in the summer. Per her request, memorials will be given to the Myositis Association for research of this dreadful disease.",

The deployment builds on the organizations\u2019 partnership, which began in 2023 as part of the BasQ initiative to further establish the Basque Country as a leading technology hub. Since the initial announcement, the parties have agreed to update the original plan to install an IBM Quantum System One, to now deploy IBM\u2019s most advanced modular quantum computer, IBM Quantum System Two, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2025.\n\nBasQ\u2019s IBM Quantum System Two, to be managed by IBM, will be powered by an IBM Quantum Heron, the company\u2019s most performant quantum processor to date, engineered to expand to multiple processors in the future. IBM Heron is capable of executing utility-scale algorithms beyond the capabilities of brute-force, classical simulation methods, including leveraging Qiskit software to accurately run certain classes of quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gate operations.\n\nThis installation dedicated to Spain\u2019s quantum innovators across academia, research labs, and industries represents IBM\u2019s continued effort to expand Europe\u2019s quantum ecosystem. Members of the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center will have access to these capabilities and resources to help build a quantum workforce, promote economic development, and develop new, useful algorithms to, in turn, help accomplish the Basque Country Government\u2019s IKUR 2030 vision for quantum technologies. These efforts in algorithm development would be directly applied toward accomplishing IKUR 2030 goals, such as research into modeling new materials, research into how quantum computing can be used as part of the initiative\u2019s broader sustainability efforts.\n\n\u201cWith this scientific infrastructure, the Basque Country will be positioned as a global reference hub in quantum computing. This technology will help progress in the digital transformation and provide us with a state-of-the-art scientific infrastructure that will strengthen the scientific, technological and innovation ecosystem that must facilitate this transformation. The IBM Quantum System Two will be a key tool for the Basque Network for Science, Technology and Innovation to generate cutting-edge knowledge in the Basque Country, to implement highly specialized higher education programs at our universities, and to be prepared for the impact of quantum computing in the coming years by both the Basque public sector and the industry. The arrival of this computer will be a great opportunity for the Basque Country\u2019s economic and social development and will enable us to cooperate with other regions, countries and actors in the development and impact of this technology,\u201d said the President of the Basque Country Government, Mr. Imanol Pradales.\n\n\u201cThe IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center\u2019s dedicated IBM Quantum System Two will give Spain\u2019s quantum community of researchers, developers, and industry experts unparalleled access to our most performant, most advanced quantum technologies\u2014including the tools to develop algorithms that will help drive the entire quantum ecosystem toward achieving a quantum advantage within the next two years,\u201d said Jay Gambetta, Vice President, IBM Quantum.\n\nAbout the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center\n\nThe IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center was announced in 2023 to promote the use of advanced technology across all the Basque Country Government and the General Deputations (Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa), further elevating research institutions by expanding international research collaborations, performing world-class fundamental scientific research, and increasing the quantum-trained talent in the region. The center will provide computational infrastructure for researchers from the Basque Government and its partners to help researchers meet these goals.\n\nIBM and the Basque Government are also collaborating to develop workforce programs aimed at building and establishing world-class talent in the Basque Country and across Spain. The IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center programs are driving internal and external awareness, education, and skill building through the development of immersive and integrated learning programs.\n\nSOURCE: IBM",

            "content": "Quantum computing and AI: Here's everything IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said at SXSW in Austin\n\nArtificial intelligence is not the only hot tech topic at South by Southwest Conference and Festival this year.\n\nOne of technology's most buzzworthy emergent fields, quantum computing, was a top conversation for IBM CEO Arvind Krishna's keynote at SXSW on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDuring his talk, Krishna discussed the geopolitics, international workforce, leveraging quantum computing for the future and how governments are investing in one of tech's most talked about sectors.\n\n\"I'm incredibly excited about quantum,\" Krishna said. \"There are some who go out there and posit this is 1,520 years (away). I'll tell you; it's going to surprise you before this decade is up. That gives us only four more years, just to be clear, and I think that we're going to see surprising things about quantum in the next four years.\"\n\nHere's everything we took away from Krishna's Tuesday keynote:\n\nWhat is quantum computing and how is it different from AI?\n\nQuantum computing has made waves over recent months.\n\nBig Tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have each made announcements related to the emerging field. But what is quantum computing and how is it different from AI?\n\nQuantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that traditional computers, and even some supercomputers, cannot process or manage. \"Quantum\" enables faster calculations and allows computers to explore multiple possibilities simultaneously.\n\nAI, on the other hand, allows computers to perform tasks or answer questions previously requiring human intelligence.\n\nKrishna compared traditional computing, and even complex AI, to high school algebra. Quantum computing, on the other hand, goes beyond college level math and computing courses.\n\n\"Even AI, which has got really complicated linear algebra inside it, the core of it will come back to high school algebra,\" Krishna said. \"Where people in college normally lose computing is when it becomes probabilistic. ... It becomes very complicated math and becomes almost impossible to solve. Normal supercomputers can't do it. Quantum does it inherently by actually trying to leverage what our quantum properties are.\"\n\nKrishna explained that quantum computing involves exploring all possible answers and probabilities to find a solution, rather than solving for a specific variable like x or y. He described AI and quantum computing as \"completely complementary\" to each other.\n\nFor example, Krishna explained that when a person drinks coffee, AI can identify that the caffeine molecule provides them with energy. AI can describe the structure of the molecule, including the number of electrons it has, but it cannot explain why caffeine molecules give people energy while other, similar molecules do not.\n\nThat's where quantum computing comes in.\n\n\"That is what quantum is going to do,\" Krishna said. \"Once we get down to that level of subatomic knowledge, it tells us how nature behaves. Once we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that isn't the existing knowledge. That's why I believe the two complement each other as opposed to compete with each other.\"\n\nGeopolitics and the AI trade\n\nKrishna said the biggest concerns that keep him up at night are finding the right talent for his company and the current state of geopolitics.\n\n\"Geopolitics kind of stayed out of our way for about 80 years, more or less, and now geopolitics is back,\" Krishna said. \"That doesn't mean that globalism is dead, but we have to worry about the geopolitics.\"\n\nIBM, like many major tech companies, has offices around the world and works closely with various governments, universities and other companies as part of its business. He said a large part of what's going to be affected by geopolitics are the supply chain; international workforce and talent acquisition; and getting nations across the world up to speed on the systems and technology, like AI and quantum, to make it accessible worldwide.\n\nKrishna brought out Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to discuss how IBM is working with the state of Illinois and Illinois higher education institutions to advance quantum research.\n\nIBM announced in December that in collaboration with Illinois, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, they are establishing the National Quantum Algorithm Center in the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, or IQMP, in Chicago.\n\nThe center will be fueled by IBM's quantum computer, IBM Quantum System Two, which is set to be deployed in Chicago this year. IBM has entered other partnerships with governments and universities worldwide, including in Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"I knew that if we're going to, as a state, if we're going to leap ahead, we've got to be in the arena that's a little bit ahead of everybody else,\" said Pritzker, who led Illinois' $200 million investment in quantum research and development in 2020. \"And so Illinois is, and I believe we will continue to be.\"\n\nKrishna said a big piece of his company's success comes from finding the right talent, and that often means international talent and finding people from outside the U.S. to bring in to the company.\n\nPritzker, who joined Krishna on stage briefly Tuesday, said finding the right workforce means having the immigration policies necessary to aid that.\n\n\"We want people to come here and bring their talent with them and apply that talent, and we want to develop our own talent as well,\" Pritzker said. \"But you can't develop it as well if you're not bringing the best people from across the world for our people to learn from too. So we should be an international talent hub, and we should have policies that go along with.\"\n\nKrishna said IBM pulls most of its talent from higher education institutions worldwide, and the existence of remote work capabilities and policies allow IBM to hire form a global talent pool despite immigration difficulties into the U.S.\n\nHe said: \"There is enough noise on both sides of the aisle that you do want to preserve that talent, that we will come to some policies that will let that set go. That is different than wide scale, national level immigration policy.\"\n\nBefore discussing the global economy, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, Krishna addressed the recent declines in AI-related stocks, which include companies involved in microchip production, software, power and data center construction.\n\nThe AI trade has had a rough 2025, seeing tumbling stocks in recent weeks and days. These dips are in part thanks to recent AI controversy, government policies and the emergence of surprising, cheaper tech, like DeepSeek.\n\nKrishna said he's not worried.\n\n\"Short answer, yes, we're going to be OK,\" Krishna said. \"A bit more context, if you just look at the overall demographics \u2014 unemployment, productivity, the strength of the US economy \u2014 that tells me we're going to be fine in the medium and (long) term. Could there be a little bit of short-term uncertainty? Perhaps. Markets don't like uncertainty. That leads to what we observed yesterday and today, but I think we're going to be completely fine in the medium and long term.\"\n\nFuture of AI and quantum\n\nIBM, the largest industrial researcher in the world, is working with governments and universities around the work to research and develop quantum computers, with a goal of building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer by 2029. IBM's 2029 goals also include making quantum systems with 200 qubits capable of running 100 million gates available to users.\n\nAI has many public use cases that are tangibly seen every day, whereas quantum computing doesn't.\n\nKrishna said quantum computing's technology, industrywide, isn't quite ready for a marketing or public use campaign to show off its powers to the lives of everyday people.\n\nDespite this, quantum has made news over recent months.\n\nGoogle announced its quantum chip \"Willow\" in December. Microsoft announced its new quantum chip \"Majorana 1\" in February, making waves as the company said its new semiconductor is based on a new state of matter. Less than two weeks later, Amazon announced \"Ocelot.\"\n\n\"So, our efforts, whether in Chicago or working with the federal government or with universities or around the world, is to make people do problems on quantum that actually show the public benefit and the use cases once those are big enough so you can do them. Today they're small, so they're not that interesting,\" Krishna said. \"If they get big enough, that'll define a moment. That'll take the world by storm. Then we can begin the marketing, not before that.\"",

            "content": "Facing legal challenges and White House pressure, IBM has ditched a corporate policy which considered diversity hiring when calculating executive pay.\n\nIn its latest annual report, released this week, the large Triangle employer and owner of the Raleigh software giant Red Hat also stopped using the word \u201cdiversity\u201d after using the word multiple times in recent yearly reports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to underscore that diversity is not a metric for compensation,\u201d IBM spokesperson Sarah Minkel told The News & Observer in an email Tuesday.\n\nIn early 2021, months removed from the murder of George Floyd and a summer of social justice protests, IBM began sharing overviews of its \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\u201d That year, the global technology company also added \u201ca diversity modifier\u201d which influenced executive compensation, crediting managers whose hiring efforts better reflected the diversity of their communities.\n\nBut in its 2024 annual report, IBM doesn\u2019t use \u201cdiversity\u201d at all. There is no \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d subsection nor mention of the \u201cdiversity modifier.\u201d It is the first time IBM didn\u2019t include \u201cdiversity\u201d in its annual report since 2016.\n\nIBM isn\u2019t alone in pivoting from diversity, equity and inclusion language and practice. Since President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Meta, Target and Walmart are among the corporations to have reserved DEI initiatives.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order ending \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility mandates\u201d in the federal government. \u201cWe\u2019ve ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government,\u201d the president said during his March 4 joint address to Congress. \u201cAnd, indeed, the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.\u201d\n\nLike many large tech companies, IBM counts the U.S. government as a client. According to its website, the company has federal contracts with the federal General Services Administration, National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Army.\n\nHeadquartered in New York State\u2019s Westchester County, IBM maintains a significant presence in the Triangle. An early tenant of Research Triangle Park, it today is the seventh-largest employer in Durham County (the company declined to share its local headcount). IBM\u2019s Triangle ties deepened in 2019 when it acquired the prominent Raleigh open source software provider Red Hat.\n\nAn aerial view of the Red Hat building in downtown Raleigh Thursday, Feb. 16, 2023.\n\nDiversity hiring policies at Red Hat and its parent have come under attack over the past two years. In December 2023, the law firm America First Legal filed a federal civil rights complaint against IBM, the day after a leaked video from 2021 showed IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and Red Hat CEO Paul Cormier describing their efforts to achieving a more racially diverse staff.\n\nAmerica First Legal was headed by Stephen Miller, a Duke University graduate who now serves as Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy. Then in May, the law firm represented a white former Red Hat employee who sued the Triangle software company, alleging its goals to achieve a more racial and gender diverse workforce contributed to his 2023 layoff. This case is ongoing.\n\nAccording to the claim, Red Hat aims to have women make up 30% of its global staff and people of color comprise 30% of its U.S. workforce by 2028. According to demographic data on the company\u2019s website, 72.6% of Red Hat\u2019s U.S. staff is white.\n\n\u2018Just throwing DEI away\u2019\n\nIn December, the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation filed a shareholder resolution challenging IBM\u2019s diversity policies. \u201cIBM ought to be recruiting employees without regard to race, gender, religious beliefs or political affiliation, and empowering its many managers/executives to make decisions regarding recruitment and promotion in the same nondiscriminatory manner,\u201d the resolution read.\n\nAs recently as Jan. 29, The Heritage Foundation demanded \u201cgreater transparency\u201d from IBM regarding its DEI initiatives.\n\n\u201cIBM has a longstanding commitment to equal opportunity and fostering an inclusive culture,\u201d Minkel said. \u201cDiscrimination of any kind has absolutely no place at IBM.\u201d\n\nPolitical momentum has swung against corporate diversity initiatives since IBM introduced its compensation diversity modifier in 2021. Some DEI proponents don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll swing back.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of companies are just throwing DEI away,\u201d said Yvonne Jackson, founder of the Chapel Hill-based corporate culture consulting firm SocialEDG.\n\nAvoiding this precise three-letter term does not bother Jackson, who said \u201cDEI\u201d has \u201cbeen sullied.\u201d But she argued something important is lost when employers don\u2019t acknowledge their workers\u2019 differences.\n\n\u201cThe more that their identity essentially is totally ignored, that\u2019s going to have an impact on your company,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd down the line, what does that impact? It impacts money.\u201d\n\nNC Reality Check is an N&O series holding those in power accountable and shining a light on public issues that affect the Triangle or North Carolina.

IBM\u2019s Arvind Krishna disagrees, arguing AI will assist and empower developers without taking their jobs.\n\nThese opposing views amplify concerns regarding AI\u2019s impact on the entire job market, igniting discussions on how to prepare.\n\nAnthropic vs. IBM: The debate over AI\u2019s role in coding\n\nThe Anthropic CEO points to Claude Code and GitHub Copilot as evidence that developers will soon only supervise AI-generated code.\n\nIBM\u2019s CEO argues that artificial intelligence will only handle 20-30% of coding tasks and will complement human programmers rather than replace them. He compares this to past technological advancement that improved efficiency without eliminating jobs.\n\nIf Amodei\u2019s prediction holds true, the software industry could face a seismic shift, potentially leading to fewer entry-level coding roles and a surge in demand for AI oversight and architecture specialists. On the other hand, if Krishna is right, programmers will work substantially faster while concentrating on complex development AI software can\u2019t tackle alone.\n\nAI threatens more than just coding jobs\n\nProgramming isn\u2019t the only profession facing AI disruption, as data entry positions, translation services, and basic accounting roles are being replaced by automation. These jobs share a common vulnerability: they involve predictable patterns and structured information that current AI models can process at a fraction of human cost.\n\nWhile workforce fears grow about AI taking jobs, some professions stand on firmer ground through their reliance on distinctly human capabilities. For example, social workers and healthcare workers are still safe from AI because their roles demand emotional intelligence, ethical judgement, and the ability to form meaningful connections, qualities that even advanced AI systems can\u2019t easily replicate.\n\nDefending your job against AI takeover\n\nMastering AI remains the most effective defense against job displacement, as those who control the technology hold greater value in the workforce.

The deployment builds on the organizations' partnership, which began in 2023 as part of the BasQ initiative to further establish the Basque Country as a leading technology hub. Since the initial announcement, the parties have agreed to update the original plan to install an IBM Quantum System One, to now deploy IBM's most advanced modular quantum computer, IBM Quantum System Two, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2025.\n\nRepresentatives* from IBM, the Basque Government, and the Basque Foundation for Science in the Basque Country of Spain at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, in front of the first IBM Quantum System Two, to announce plans to install Europe\u2019s first IBM Quantum System Two at the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center by the end of 2025. (Credit: IBM)\n\nBasQ's IBM Quantum System Two, to be managed by IBM, will be powered by an IBM Quantum Heron, the company's most performant quantum processor to date, engineered to expand to multiple processors in the future. IBM Heron is capable of executing utility-scale algorithms beyond the capabilities of brute-force, classical simulation methods, including leveraging Qiskit software to accurately run certain classes of quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gate operations.\n\nThis installation dedicated to Spain's quantum innovators across academia, research labs, and industries represents IBM's continued effort to expand Europe's quantum ecosystem. Members of the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center will have access to these capabilities and resources to help build a quantum workforce, promote economic development, and develop new, useful algorithms to, in turn, help accomplish the Basque Country Government's IKUR 2030 vision for quantum technologies. These efforts in algorithm development would be directly applied toward accomplishing IKUR 2030 goals, such as research into modeling new materials, research into how quantum computing can be used as part of the initiative's broader sustainability efforts.\n\n\"With this scientific infrastructure, the Basque Country will be positioned as a global reference hub in quantum computing. This technology will help progress in the digital transformation and provide us with a state-of-the-art scientific infrastructure that will strengthen the scientific, technological and innovation ecosystem that must facilitate this transformation. The IBM Quantum System Two will be a key tool for the Basque Network for Science, Technology and Innovation to generate cutting-edge knowledge in the Basque Country, to implement highly specialized higher education programs at our universities, and to be prepared for the impact of quantum computing in the coming years by both the Basque public sector and the industry. The arrival of this computer will be a great opportunity for the Basque Country's economic and social development and will enable us to cooperate with other regions, countries and actors in the development and impact of this technology,\" said the President of the Basque Country Government, Mr. Imanol Pradales.\n\n\"The IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center's dedicated IBM Quantum System Two will give Spain's quantum community of researchers, developers, and industry experts unparalleled access to our most performant, most advanced quantum technologies\u2014including the tools to develop algorithms that will help drive the entire quantum ecosystem toward achieving a quantum advantage within the next two years,\" said Jay Gambetta, Vice President, IBM Quantum.\n\nAbout the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center\n\nThe IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center was announced in 2023 to promote the use of advanced technology across all the Basque Country Government and the General Deputations (Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa), further elevating research institutions by expanding international research collaborations, performing world-class fundamental scientific research, and increasing the quantum-trained talent in the region. The center will provide computational infrastructure for researchers from the Basque Government and its partners to help researchers meet these goals.\n\nIBM and the Basque Government are also collaborating to develop workforce programs aimed at building and establishing world-class talent in the Basque Country and across Spain.

These developments may have positively influenced investor sentiment, potentially contributing to IBM's share price increase of 7.48% in the last quarter.\n\nClick to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings in International Business Machines' financial health report.\n\nNYSE:IBM Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nInterested In Other Possibilities? Rare earth metals are an input to most high-tech devices, military and defence systems and electric vehicles. The global race is on to secure supply of these critical minerals. Beat the pack to uncover the best rare earth metal stocks of the very few that mine this essential strategic resource.\n\nOver the past five years, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has experienced a substantial total shareholder return of 217.29%. This performance reflects both market-driven dynamics and several pivotal corporate developments. Notably, IBM's strategic alliances, such as the expanded collaboration with Juniper Networks in February 2025 to optimize IT networks using AI, played a significant role in the company's growth. Additionally, IBM launched Granite 3.2 in late February 2025, enhancing enterprise applications, which likely bolstered investor confidence. The steady increase in dividends, including the recent quarterly declaration of US$1.67 per share in January 2025, further underscores IBM's commitment to shareholder value.\n\nIBM's financial performance demonstrated a complex landscape. Despite the recent Q4 2024 financial results showing a decline in net income to US$2.92 billion compared to the previous year, its robust return on equity at 21.96% implies efficient profit generation. Comparative to the US IT industry, IBM outperformed, achieving a higher one-year return than the industry\u2019s 4.2% performance, indicating significant relative resilience.

The deployment builds on the organizations' partnership, which began in 2023 as part of the BasQ initiative to further establish the Basque Country as a leading technology hub. Since the initial announcement, the parties have agreed to update the original plan to install an IBM Quantum System One, to now deploy IBM's most advanced modular quantum computer, IBM Quantum System Two, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2025.\n\nBasQ's IBM Quantum System Two, to be managed by IBM, will be powered by an IBM Quantum Heron, the company's most performant quantum processor to date, engineered to expand to multiple processors in the future. IBM Heron is capable of executing utility-scale algorithms beyond the capabilities of brute-force, classical simulation methods, including leveraging Qiskit software to accurately run certain classes of quantum circuits with up to 5,000 two-qubit gate operations.\n\nThis installation dedicated to Spain's quantum innovators across academia, research labs, and industries represents IBM's continued effort to expand Europe's quantum ecosystem. Members of the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center will have access to these capabilities and resources to help build a quantum workforce, promote economic development, and develop new, useful algorithms to, in turn, help accomplish the Basque Country Government's IKUR 2030 vision for quantum technologies. These efforts in algorithm development would be directly applied toward accomplishing IKUR 2030 goals, such as research into modeling new materials, research into how quantum computing can be used as part of the initiative's broader sustainability efforts.\n\n\"With this scientific infrastructure, the Basque Country will be positioned as a global reference hub in quantum computing. This technology will help progress in the digital transformation and provide us with a state-of-the-art scientific infrastructure that will strengthen the scientific, technological and innovation ecosystem that must facilitate this transformation. The IBM Quantum System Two will be a key tool for the Basque Network for Science, Technology and Innovation to generate cutting-edge knowledge in the Basque Country, to implement highly specialized higher education programs at our universities, and to be prepared for the impact of quantum computing in the coming years by both the Basque public sector and the industry. The arrival of this computer will be a great opportunity for the Basque Country's economic and social development and will enable us to cooperate with other regions, countries and actors in the development and impact of this technology,\" said the President of the Basque Country Government, Mr. Imanol Pradales.\n\n\"The IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center's dedicated IBM Quantum System Two will give Spain's quantum community of researchers, developers, and industry experts unparalleled access to our most performant, most advanced quantum technologies\u2014including the tools to develop algorithms that will help drive the entire quantum ecosystem toward achieving a quantum advantage within the next two years,\" said Jay Gambetta, Vice President, IBM Quantum.\n\nAbout the IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center\n\nThe IBM-Euskadi Quantum Computational Center was announced in 2023 to promote the use of advanced technology across all the Basque Country Government and the General Deputations (Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa ), further elevating research institutions by expanding international research collaborations, performing world-class fundamental scientific research, and increasing the quantum-trained talent in the region. The center will provide computational infrastructure for researchers from the Basque Government and its partners to help researchers meet these goals.\n\nIBM and the Basque Government are also collaborating to develop workforce programs aimed at building and establishing world-class talent in the Basque Country and across Spain .

            "content": "Data literacy: AI can process vast amounts of data and generate forecasts, but it doesn\u2019t always get things right. A CFO must understand how AI models work, spot potential flaws and know when human judgment is needed.\n\n\n\nFor example, an AI-driven financial model predicts a 30% increase in revenue next quarter based on historical trends. However, the CFO knows that a major regulatory change is coming that will impact sales. If the CFO blindly trusts the AI, the company might overcommit resources and suffer financial losses. Instead, they adjust the forecast based on external market knowledge, ensuring a more realistic financial strategy.\n\n\n\nAI can only work with the data it has\u2014it can\u2019t account for unexpected market shifts, legal changes or company-specific strategic moves. CFOs need to interpret AI-driven insights with a critical eye.\n\n\n\nStorytelling and communication: AI can generate complex financial reports and projections, but numbers alone don\u2019t drive decisions\u2014people do. A CFO must take AI-driven insights and translate them into compelling business narratives that executives, investors and teams can understand and act on.\n\n\n\nFor example, an AI tool detects a declining profit margin in a key product line. Instead of presenting the data as a problem, the CFO is strategic. They would frame the issue as an opportunity, advising that they could recover lost margin by adjusting pricing and renegotiating supplier contracts. They would then use AI-generated scenario analysis to show the impact of different pricing models. Finally, they would craft a compelling story for leadership that explains why the recommended strategy is the best path forward.\n\n\n\nCFOs aren\u2019t just number crunchers\u2014they\u2019re business storytellers who use AI-driven insights to persuade, influence and drive action.\n\n\n\nCritical thinking: AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If they are biased, miss data or make flawed assumptions, AI can produce misleading results. A CFO must be able to question AI outputs and ensure that they make sense in a real-world business context.\n\n\n\nFor example, an AI system recommends massive cost cuts in the R&D (research and development) department to improve short-term profitability. On the surface, this plan seems logical, but the CFO recognizes that cutting R&D would damage long-term innovation and put the company at risk. Instead of blindly following AI\u2019s recommendation, the CFO balances short-term efficiency with long-term strategy, ensuring sustainable growth.\n\n\n\nAI doesn\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d\u2014it follows patterns. CFOs must act as a filter, separating useful insights from flawed recommendations that might hurt the company in the end.\n\n\n\nEmotional intelligence: AI can analyze data, but it can\u2019t build trust, negotiate deals or lead teams. A CFO\u2019s ability to manage relationships, understand emotions and influence stakeholders is irreplaceable.\n\n\n\nFor example, a company is going through a major restructuring, and AI suggests layoffs to cut costs. The CFO doesn\u2019t just accept the AI\u2019s recommendation. They engage with department heads to understand the impact on morale and operations and then explore alternative cost-saving measures (for instance, efficiency improvements or redeploying staff to growing areas). They communicate transparently with employees, ensuring trust and alignment with leadership.\n\n",

            "content": "Some photographers who contributed photos to the Flickr photo-sharing site were surprised IBM used those same photos in a million-image collection to train AI face-recognition systems -- but perhaps they shouldn't have been.\n\nThe Flickr photos had been shared under a Creative Commons license, a framework under which people can loosen restrictions on photos, text, video or other material that otherwise would be protected by copyright. CC licenses can bar commercial use or require others using the photos to attribute them to their source, but the general idea is to make the work available for others to use.\n\n\"None of the people I photographed had any idea their images were being used in this way...It seems a little sketchy that IBM can use these pictures without saying anything to anybody,\" Greg Peverill-Conti, an executive at public relations firm SharpOrange whose photos were used, told NBC News Tuesday.\n\nIBM used only photos licensed under Creative Commons, and IBM's legal team approved the program, a company representative said. The data is offered only to academic researchers through a project called Diversity in Faces. The faces are annotated with human observations about factors like sex and age and with geometric measurements, and they are intended to help researchers counter bias that can undermine AI fairness.\n\n\"We take the privacy of individuals very seriously and have taken great care to comply with privacy principles, including limiting the Diversity in Faces dataset to publicly available image annotations and limiting the access of the dataset to verified researchers. Individuals can opt-out of this dataset,\" spokesman Saswato Das said in a statement. \"IBM has been committed to building responsible, fair and trusted technologies for more than a century and believes it is critical to strive for fairness and accuracy in facial recognition.\"\n\nOne lesson here: If you don't want your imagery used to train artificial intelligence systems -- or to appear in books, Wikipedia articles, art projects and corporate PowerPoint presentations -- choose your Creative Commons licenses carefully or don't use them at all. Even then you might be surprised, since IBM's use -- reduced-size images that have been significantly annotated -- is arguably transformative and therefore permissible even with copyrighted images under copyright law's fair-use provisions. So perhaps the only way to truly avoid having your photos used in AI is to avoid sharing them at all.\n\nCreative Commons details\n\nYou might also like the Creative Commons ethos. Sharing data that researchers may freely use -- to rid AI systems of racial bias, for example, or to improve voice recognition, as with Mozilla's Common Voice project -- is arguably a laudable goal.\n\nThe Creative Commons organization, a nonprofit that oversees the licenses, didn't comment on IBM's specific usage. But Chief Executive Ryan Merkley said the matter of faces used to train AI systems is broader than just a licensing issue.\n\n\"Our tools were built to solve for copyright, and they do that well,\" Merkley said. \"But copyright isn't a good tool to address privacy, or research ethics, or surveillance AI.\"\n\nThe organization published a blog post about the IBM-Flickr case and FAQ about the AI situation more broadly on Wednesday.\n\nOne sticking point is whether IBM's use is noncommercial. It offered the images only to academic researchers, but IBM benefits commercially from a higher profile in the world of AI, too. IBM didn't comment on the broader commercial issue of its program.\n\nMerkley didn't pass judgment on IBM's use. But he did say the permission depends on how CC-licensed images are using them, not who is using them. \"Being a company doesn't necessarily mean you can't use non-commercial content,\" he said.\n\nMore than 700 of Peverill-Conti's photos are in the collection and some photographers had trouble getting IBM to remove their photos from the data set, NBC News said. Peverill-Conti didn't respond to CNET's request for comment.\n\nFlickr defends IBM's usage\n\nFlickr's leader, SmugMug Chief Executive Don MacAskill, tweeted on Tuesday that IBM retrieved the photos before SmugMug acquired the photo-sharing site. However, he defended IBM's type of usage as adhering to the principles of Creative Commons.\n\n\"We love & support photographers and their right to choose their own licenses for their work. By default, they reserve all of their rights, and have the option to loosen them if they'd like,\" MacAskill tweeted.\n\n\"People didn't have to opt-in to the dataset because they had already opted into the Creative Commons license. They took action. This is the way licensing works. It's also the magic that enables artists & scientists all over the world to create & invent using CC-licensed works,\" he added.\n\nFlickr has more than 400 million photos shared under Creative Commons licenses. Although Flickr eliminated a Yahoo-era plan that offered photographers a free terabyte of photo storage, it exempts Creative Commons shots from the limit.\n\nOriginally published March 12 at 7:10 p.m. PT.\n\nUpdate, 8:21 p.m. PT: Adds further comment from IBM.\n\nUpdate, March 13: Adds further background and comment from Merkley and links to Creative Commons information on the subject.",

            "content": "IBM (IBM) ended the recent trading session at $249.74, demonstrating a +0.32% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.49% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.22%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 2.26% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 12.07% and the S&P 500's loss of 8.15% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of IBM in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.43, indicating a 14.88% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.44 billion, showing a 0.18% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.78 per share and revenue of $64.85 billion. These totals would mark changes of +4.36% and +3.34%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.31% higher. IBM is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.\n\nInvestors should also note IBM's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.08. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 13.27.\n\nIt is also worth noting that IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 5.46. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.52.",

Breakthroughs are instead expected to come from AI working in complement with quantum computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAI is learning from already produced knowledge, literature, graphics and so on, it is not trying to figure out what is going to come,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuantum computers instead work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. Quantum computing technology, when achieved in full, has the potential to be much faster than regular computers and could go beyond what AI systems can provide to give insights into \u201chow nature behaves,\u201d the IBM chief said, particularly on a sub-atomic level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce we know how nature behaves, then we can learn a lot more, because none of that is in existing knowledge,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nThe industry\u2019s belief in how fast quantum computing technology can scale up has wavered recently. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg claimed that useful quantum computers are 15-30 years away, which tanked quantum computing stocks like IonQ (IONQ+12.17% ) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI+16.80% ).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the technology has more progress it needs to count, Krishna believes that quantum computing is \u201cgoing to surprise you before this decade is up.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t the only person to believe this either. Microsoft (MSFT+1.30% ) co-founder Bill Gates told Yahoo Finance last month that quantum computing could become useful in as soon as 3 to 5 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there have been recent advancements in quantum computing, most notably in December when Google (GOOGL+0.84% ) unveiled its latest quantum chip Willow. Google claims the chip will greatly reduce error rates, one of the greatest challenges plaguing quantum technology.\n\nOn the other hand, the biggest problems facing AI, according to Krishna, are a lack of domain specificity \u2014 in depth knowledge of particular fields or application areas \u2014 as well as the technology\u2019s notorious energy intensity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll predict for you that five years from now, most of the models are going to be using 1% of the energy of what they\u2019re using today,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cI think DeepSeek gave us a preview.\u201d\n\nQuantum computing, while still costly, has the potential to be less energy intensive than AI data centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKrishna also said that IBM is working on building practical use cases for the technology, not just investing in making the quantum computing hardware.\n\n\u201cIn the end, to me, value in technology is not derived from the invention. Much as we love the invention, value is derived from people using it,\u201d Krishna said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes, when we get ahead of ourselves, we get too focused on the invention and not on making sure that there are hundreds and thousands of different companies, private and public, that are using it. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get done in this case and I think we\u2019re kind of going at the right pace in this instance,\u201d he added.\n\nIndustry leaders will be getting together on March 20th for Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA+3.90% ) first \u201cQuantum Day,\u201d at the tech giant\u2019s GPU Technology Conference to discuss where quantum computing is headed.",

In 2022, a Texas court ordered Big Blue to pay BMC $1.6 billion for breach of contract.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned that ruling last year, finding that AT&T independently chose to replace BMC's software with IBM's, and that Big Blue's actions were permissible under the existing contract.\n\nThe legal battle concluded on Monday after the US Supreme Court refused [PDF] to review BMC's appeal, effectively upholding the appellate court's decision in favor of IBM. KKR, the parent company of BMC, declined to comment, and BMC has not responded to our inquiries regarding the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, in the UK, IBM won its legal battle against software startup LzLabs, owned by John Moores, the same person who founded BMC Software.\n\nBig Blue had accused the Zurich-based software vendor of using a UK-based subsidiary to purchase an IBM mainframe in 2023 and reverse engineer part of it to further develop a software-defined mainframe (SDM) platform, allegedly in breach of its license agreement with IBM.\n\nAs we've previously discussed, LzLabs' SDM offering, launched in 2016, claimed to enable customers to run mainframe code on standard Linux servers and cloud platforms.\n\nAfter a trial last year, High Court Judge Finola O'Farrell ruled in IBM's favor on Monday after determining that Winsopia, a UK-based subsidiary of LzLabs, had in fact violated Big Blue's terms of service.\n\n\"IBM is delighted that the court has upheld our claims against Winsopia, LzLabs GmbH, and John Moores,\" an IBM spokesperson told El Reg.\n\n\"The court found that these parties had conspired to breach Winsopia's licence agreement in a deliberate, systematic and intentionally hidden effort to unlawfully reverse engineer critical IBM mainframe technology. This technology represents billions of dollars of IBM investment.\"\n\nWe've asked LzLabs for comment regarding the decision; we'll let you know if we hear anything back.\n\nWhile IBM has claimed victory in its UK lawsuit, Big Blue's case against LzLabs in the US is still ongoing. \u00ae",

            "content": "Japan has become one of the major world leaders in quantum computing.\n\nThe story began in 2019, when the University of Tokyo together with IBM launched the Japan-IBM Quantum\u2122 Partnership\u2014a partnership which brought to Japan its first IBM Quantum System One. Since then, the university has become a center of quantum computing science, and its IBM Quantum System One has been actively used by members of the Quantum Innovation Initiative Consortium launched jointly by the University of Tokyo and IBM, with the Consortium including leading Japanese companies like JSR, Toyota, Mitsubishi Chemicals, SoftBank, Sony and more.\n\nThrough that work, Japanese industry has played a key role in advancing quantum computing technology.\n\nJapan and the University of Tokyo\u2019s contributions go beyond the science of quantum computing. The University of Tokyo with IBM has helped develop the supply chain and ecosystem of Japanese quantum hardware suppliers through the world-first Quantum Hardware Test Center established in 2021. In an emerging market like quantum computing, growing the supply chain requires a focused approach centered on developing the components required for the industry. We\u2019re beginning to see the flywheel effect in action\u2014the accumulation of new research at Japanese institutions, new technology from industrial leaders, and collaboration between the United States and Japan have generated significant momentum and the seeds of a self-sustaining quantum industry.\n\nJapan has become a model for building that supply chain and enabling quantum ecosystem growth. The University of Tokyo Quantum Hardware Test Center has been a crucial part of that story. As manufacturers such as TDK Corporation, Fujikura, Keycom, and I-PEX work on quantum computing components, the test center gives them the opportunity to access the specialized infrastructure necessary for evaluating the components\u2019 performance. Beyond the test center, Japanese enterprises ULVAC and Kyocera are building important components and infrastructure for quantum computers, anchored by the demand created by IBM.\n\nJust a few years ago, quantum computing was an exploratory technology operating exclusively in the realm of toy problems and academic research. Today, a worldwide community of users benefits from the industry-leading scale, quality, and speed of IBM quantum computers. That community has picked this technology up off the laboratory bench and brought it into the industrial workplace.\n\nIBM has published a comprehensive roadmap to advance useful quantum computing that details our timeline for building large scale, fault tolerant quantum computers. As part of that work, IBM provides specifications for key components of current and future quantum computers to potential vendors. Through the University of Tokyo Quantum Hardware Test Center, IBM has worked with many suppliers to test some of these components.\n\nThe companies bringing quantum to life in Japan\n\nTDK is a Tokyo-based company that builds electronic components, leads the world in magnetic technology, and has the largest market share in small-size batteries like those used in smartphones. Their components can be found in connected cars, industrial robots, smartphones and IoT smart devices powered AI. TDK has made great strides in developing and demonstrating cryogenic microwave isolators. These are key components in quantum computing systems built around superconducting qubits. TDK has used the University of Tokyo Quantum Hardware Test Center for early verification of their progress.\n\nAnother crucial component in superconducting qubit technology is the dilution refrigerator. Dilution refrigerators cycle helium isotopes through a mixing chamber to achieve the milliKelvin operating temperatures of superconducting qubits. ULVAC, Inc., a vacuum technology leader based in Chigasaki, is working to build a state-of-the-art dilution refrigerator that meets IBM quantum cryostat specifications. We look forward to testing ULVAC cryostats at our quantum datacenter later in 2025.\n\n\"IBM is leading the advancement of quantum computing, and ULVAC is proud to support this effort with our expertise in vacuum and cryogenic technology,\u201d said Setsuo Iwashita, President and CEO of ULVAC, Inc. \u201cBy providing cutting-edge cryogenic solutions, we are committed to strengthening IBM\u2019s quantum computing ecosystem and enabling scalable quantum infrastructure.\"\n\nWe are committed to strengthening IBM\u2019s quantum computing ecosystem and enabling scalable quantum infrastructure.\n\nMore and more Japanese suppliers are diving into the quantum industry. We have seen impressive work ranging from cryogenic and superconducting wiring technology to high-density connectors and large-area laminates to accommodate larger quantum chips. Kyocera, the Kyoto ceramics and electronics manufacturer, is an important supplier of large-size semiconductor packaging. They now leverage that expertise for quantum applications. Fujikura, the Tokyo electronic equipment manufacturer, and Keycom, the Tokyo electronic measurement technology company, are leveraging their superconducting material expertise to develop the next generation of ultra high-density cryogenic cabling. I-PEX, in Kyoto, builds connector technology that they are evaluating for operation in the cryogenic environment of quantum computers.\n\nThis is the world\u2019s quantum computing future: a global ecosystem of enterprises bringing their expertise to bear on quantum\u2019s toughest engineering problems. We are scaling this technology through our joint efforts at the University of Tokyo and IBM. Our growing userbase is figuring out how to apply it to solve real problems. The Japanese quantum ecosystem is growing fast, thanks to the leadership of the University of Tokyo and the Japanese government\u2019s investment in quantum.

            "content": "IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says that, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on globalism, global trade isn\u2019t dead. In fact, he thinks that the U.S.\u2019s key to growth will be embracing an international exchange of goods.\n\n\u201cSo, I actually am a firm believer \u2014 I think it goes all the way back to the economists who studied global trade in the 1800s \u2014 and I think their perspective was, every 10% increase in global trade leads to a 1% increase in local GDP,\u201d Krishna said during an onstage interview at SXSW on Tuesday. \u201cSo, if we want to really optimize even for local [growth], you got to have global trade.\u201d\n\nGlobal trade goes hand in hand with allowing overseas talent to flow into the U.S., Krishna said. The administration and its allies have called for increased restrictions on student and H-1B work visas, which they claim put U.S. citizens at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWe want people to come here and bring their talent with them and apply that talent,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cAnd we want to develop our own talent as well, but you can\u2019t develop it as well if you\u2019re not bringing the best people from across the world for our people to learn from too. So we should be an international talent hub, and we should have policies that go along with that.\u201d\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Krishna touched on not only geopolitics but also AI, which he thinks is a valuable technology \u2014 but no panacea.\n\nHe disagreed with a recent prediction from Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, that 90% of code may be written by AI in the next three to six months.\n\n\u201cI think the number is going to be more like 20-30% of the code could get written by AI \u2014 not 90%\u201d Krishna said. \u201cAre there some really simple use cases? Yes, but there\u2019s an equally complicated number of ones where it\u2019s going to be zero.\u201d\n\nKrishna said he thinks AI will ultimately make programmers more productive, boosting their and their employers\u2019 outputs rather than eliminating programming jobs, as some AI critics have predicted.\n\n\u201cIf you can do 30% more code with the same number of people, are you going to get more code written or less?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause history has shown that the most productive company gains market share, and then you can produce more products, which lets you get more market share.\u201d\n\nGranted, IBM has a vested interest in presenting AI as nonthreatening. The company sells a range of AI-powered products and services, including assistive coding tools.\n\nThe statements are also a bit of a reversal for Krishna, who said in 2023 that IBM planned to pause hiring on back-office functions that the company anticipated it could replace with AI tech.\n\nKrishna compared the debates over AI replacing workers to early debates over calculators and Photoshop replacing mathematicians and artists. He acknowledged that there are \u201cunresolved\u201d challenges around intellectual property where it concerns AI training and outputs, but that ultimately, the tech is a positive \u2014 and augmenting \u2014 force.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tool,\u201d Krishna said of AI. \u201cIf the quality that everybody produces becomes better using these tools, then even for the consumer, now you\u2019re consuming better-quality [products].\u201d\n\nThis tool will get cheaper, Krishna predicted. While he noted that reasoning models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 require lots of computing and thus are energy-intensive, he thinks that AI will use \u201cless than 1%\u201d of the energy it\u2019s using today thanks to emerging techniques like those demonstrated by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cI think DeepSeek gave us a preview that you can live with a much smaller model,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cNow the question arises still, do you still need some really big models to start from? And I think that is what [DeepSeek] didn\u2019t talk about.\u201d\n\nBut while AI will commoditize, Krishna isn\u2019t convinced that it\u2019ll help humanity arrive at new knowledge, echoing a recent essay by Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf. Rather, Krishna thinks quantum computing \u2014 a technology IBM is heavily invested in, not for nothing \u2014 will be the key to accelerating scientific discovery.\n\n\u201cAI is learning from already-produced knowledge, literature, graphics, and so on,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cIt is not trying to figure out what is going to come \u2026 I am one who does not believe that the current generation of AI is going to get us towards what is called artificial general intelligence \u2026 when the AI can have all knowledge be completely reliable and answer questions beyond those that were answerable by Einstein or Oppenheimer or all the Nobel Prize laureates put together.\u201d\n\nKrishna\u2019s assertions stand in contrast to those from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has argued that \u201csuperintelligent\u201d AI is within the realm of possibility within the next few years and could massively accelerate innovation.",

            "content": "Tech giant IBM secured a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on its technology for transporting microparticles using a 4D-printed smart material. According to the patent, these smart materials can use shape-memory alloys or polymers that respond to external forces like temperature, light, magnetism, or electrical currents.\n\nAfter being deformed, the smart materials return to their original shape, allowing the researchers to induce movement in them and use them to transport minute-sized particles that would be difficult or impossible to transport using traditional delivery methods.\n\nThe user must initially set the delivery path and its environmental conditions and note the item's size, shape, weight, and composition to be delivered. Once completed, the machine learning algorithm applies the proper stimulus to move the material. This could be heat or light that causes one part or the other of the 4D material to respond, generating an action that results in an equal but opposite reaction.\n\n(Image credit: United States Patent and Trademark Office)\n\nAside from following the user's initial path, IBM\u2019s machine language monitors the 4D-printed smart material for any deviations or blockages. It will resolve the situation, allowing the operation to proceed with little human intervention. All external stimuli are removed when it reaches its destination, allowing the smart material to deliver its payload.\n\nThis design allows for the delivery of microparticles between 1 and 100 microns in diameter. Furthermore, its different control methods mean it can travel through various media, making it useful for medical and industrial applications. For example, doctors and medical technologists could use this technique to deliver drugs to specific cells via the blood or the gastrointestinal tract. It could also be used for miniature electronics manufacturing and perhaps introduce a new semiconductor manufacturing method.\n\n4D printing builds upon 3D printing technology, wherein the filament used for printing reacts to external stimuli. Researchers can then use this to generate movement, much like how a single-celled organism can move by using chemical reactions within its cell membrane.",

(Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nIBM has won a lawsuit in the UK against Swiss company LzLabs, which was accused of misappropriating trade secrets related to Big Blue\u2019s mainframe technology. The UK High Court ruled that LzLabs\u2019 UK subsidiary Winsopia had breached the terms of its software licence agreement with IBM.\n\nWinsopia bought an IBM mainframe computer and signed a licence agreement for IBM mainframe software in 2013. The case revolved around allegations that Winsopia used the access to reverse-engineer IBM\u2019s mainframe software. Besides Winsopia, the defendants in the case included another LzLabs subsidiary, LzLabs UK, and their ultimate owner US tech entrepreneur and philanthropist John Moores, who founded IT company BMC Software in 1980.\n\nIn the written ruling, Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell stated that Winsopia\u2019s actions constituted a breach of the licensing agreement and that LzLabs and John Moores had unlawfully procured such breaches. IBM welcomed the ruling.\n\n\u201c[We are] delighted that the Court has upheld our claims against Winsopia, LzLabs GmbH and John Moores,\u201d a company spokesperson told Tech Monitor. \u201cThe Court found that these parties had conspired to breach Winsopia\u2019s licence agreement in a deliberate, systematic and intentionally hidden effort to unlawfully reverse engineer critical IBM mainframe technology. This technology represents billions of dollars of IBM investment.\u201d\n\nIBM\u2019s response to the ruling\n\nAt the heart of the dispute was LzLabs\u2019 Software Defined Mainframe (SDM), launched in 2016. IBM contended that LzLabs developed SDM by reverse-engineering IBM\u2019s software. LzLabs claims SDM can empower customers to migrate their business applications originally designed to run on IBM mainframe computers to x86-based computer architectures operating on Linux, all without requiring changes to the source code or recompilation.\n\nIn December 2020/ January 2021, IBM requested an audit of Winsopia\u2019s compliance with the terms of their IBM Customer Agreement (ICA). Winsopia refused, arguing that IBM\u2019s request exceeded the scope of the contractual audit rights and made unreasonable demands within an unreasonable compliance timeframe.\n\nSubsequently, the case came to court last year. Despite LzLabs and Moores\u2019 defence that they had independently developed their software after nearly a decade of work and had not unlawfully used IBM\u2019s licensed software, the judgment ultimately favoured IBM.\n\nIBM expressed satisfaction with the court\u2019s decision. \u201cIBM is delighted that the Court has upheld our claims against Winsopia, LzLabs and John Moores,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Court found that these parties had conspired to breach Winsopia\u2019s licence agreement in a deliberate, systematic and intentionally hidden effort to unlawfully reverse engineer critical IBM mainframe technology. This technology represents billions of dollars of IBM investment.\u201d\n\nLzLabs did not respond to Reuters\u2019 queries on the court\u2019s decision. However, IBM\u2019s case against another British subsidiary LzLabs Limited, and LzLabs\u2019 current and former CEO was rejected.\n\nIn 2022, IBM sued Micro Focus for similar allegations of illegal copying and reverse engineering of its software. That lawsuit was settled in July 2024 after Rocket Software acquired the Micro Focus products involved in the dispute.\n\nRead More: GlobalFoundries and IBM settle legal dispute over chip manufacturing agreement",

After a decade with the tech company, she is now the CEO and founder of Brainwave Africa Tech, a company she is working to build as the partner of choice for Africa\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider Africa, Kyerematen-Jimoh revealed that technology was not her initial career choice, and she was reluctant to explore the field. However, while she was working as head of Corporate Banking for GT Bank in Ghana, IBM came to the country to recruit someone to lead its marketing operations in West Africa. At the time, Kyerematen-Jimoh said she was craving something different from banking. \u201cWhen I moved into IBM, I started in marketing as head of marketing for West Africa,\u201d she said. The career transition led her to Nairobi, Kenya, where she fulfilled the marketing role for about two years before she became the strategy lead for Central, East, and West Africa for IBM, a position that allowed her to work closely with the U.S. team.\n\nAfter working in the strategy role for about two years, Kyerematen-Jimoh made history when she moved to Ghana and became the first woman Country General Manager for IBM. \u201cI took over from a very respectable man, Mr. Joe Mensah, who is now the CEO of Kosmos,\u201d she said. \u201cI had very big shoes to fill because he\u2019s a chief.\u201d One thing was for sure, team building was a plus in her role. \u201cI was blessed to have a really good team,\u201d said the tech maven who was responsible for 35 countries in Africa, including Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco, and Kenya.\n\nNearly two years later, the Ghanaian business leader said she answered a call from Microsoft regarding a role as the strategic partnership lead with its Africa Transformation Office. While she was with the technology conglomerate, she developed the idea for her Brainwave company and launched it in January 2025. \u201cI got to a point in my career where I needed a new direction,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Holy Spirit was very clear\u2014it was time for me to start my own company.\u201d She will continue working with IBM and Microsoft as a business partner through Brainwave Africa Tech. Her company\u2019s mission is to build strategic partnerships with both companies as it grows to become \u201cthe partner of choice for Africa\u2019s digital transformation.\u201d Through strategic partnerships with Nigerian-based implementation partner Blue Dive, her company helmed a successful bid for a multimillion-dollar RFP in Ghana.\n\nToday, on International Women\u2019s Day, we shine the spotlight on our trailblazing CEO! From employee to employer, her remarkable journey is a testament to determination and hard work. pic.twitter.com/juFCbKd9TZ \u2014 Brainwave AfricaTech (@BAfricaTech) March 8, 2025\n\nThe tech professional started her career in marketing, a field she said she always had an interest in. After finishing her college degree and learning French, she worked at GL Trade, a financial order management and trading systems company. A client then invited her to join the ABN AMRO team in a marketing role. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re a marketer, you can sell anything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were responsible for selling the futures and options capabilities to hedge fund managers in the UK.\u201d\n\nKyerematen-Jimoh credits her mother for encouraging her to give technology a try. Marketing has been a solid foundation for her to grow in different industries. The Forbes Technology Council member advocates for women\u2019s empowerment and philanthropy. Her experience has molded her into a trusted mentor for women in business and a resource for Ghana\u2019s underprivileged communities. Her outreach continues as she looks forward to her newest project, the AI Explorers Club, which offers AI training every Friday and Saturday for children ages eight to 15.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Usher\u2019s New Look NonProfit Joins IBM To Build Tech Careers For Diverse Youth",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\n\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\n\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\n\nReal time prices by BATS.

The company then used this access to reverse engineer IBM\u2019s mainframe software.\n\nIn a written ruling, Judge Finola O\u2019Farrell said Winsopia breached its IBM license terms and that \"LzLabs and Mr. Moores unlawfully procured (those) breaches.\"\n\nMoores is the founder of BMC Software and now runs a VC fund, JMI Equity, which invests in IT businesses. He and LzLabs argued that the company\u2019s software had been developed over a decade, without any influence from IBM\u2019s technology.\n\nDCD has approached LzLabs for comment. An IBM spokesperson said: \"IBM is delighted that the Court has upheld our claims against Winsopia, LzLabs GmbH and John Moores. The Court found that these parties had conspired to breach Winsopia\u2019s license agreement in a deliberate, systematic and intentionally hidden effort to unlawfully reverse engineer critical IBM mainframe technology. This technology represents billions of dollars of IBM investment.\"\n\nA further hearing will take place later this year to determine any damages due to be paid. IBM saw claims against another British subsidiary, LzLabs Limited, as well as the company\u2019s current and former CEOs, rejected.\n\nLzLabs was founded in 2011, and launched its first product in 2016, a platform that enabled mainframe workloads written in Cobol or PL/1, to run on x86 servers and Linux.\n\nThe company has since updated its products for containerized workloads, and signed up customers including telco Swisscom which, according to LzLabs, \"successfully moved its entire mainframe workload of business-critical applications to SDM running on Linux systems in the cloud,\" without having to recompile it.\n\nThis puts the company in competition with IBM, which continues to market mainframe and mainframe modernization through its IBM Z business unit. The company\u2019s latest mainframe, the now three-year-old z16, is outperforming prior models when it comes to longevity, IBM said in July 2024.\n\nIBM opened a separate court case against LzLabs in Texas in 2022, alleging patent infringement. In this case, it is seeking damages and an injunction preventing LzLabs from marketing products containing the IBM IP.",

The average cost of compute is rising sharply\u2014and 70% of executives say generative AI is playing a key part in driving this increase.1\n\nOn the other hand, Generative AI can stretch the computing budget. 73% of executives agree that gen AI can make their use of computing resources more efficient\u2014and they\u2019re already putting this theory into practice. For example, 67% of organizations are using gen AI to accelerate the development of new and more efficient models, algorithms and applications. And 65% of organizations are using gen AI to reduce required compute resources by automating tasks.1\n\nNot every application of gen AI is created equal. Each use case has its own compute, data and privacy requirements. Still, there are two paths most businesses are traveling to unlock the treasure trove of generative AI:\n\nReady-to-launch tools: The \u201cAI for everyone\u201d option: platforms like ChatGPT come pre-trained on vast datasets, allowing users to tap into their generative prowess without reinventing the wheel. Organizations can fine-tune these models with specific data, nudging them towards outputs tailored to specific business needs. User-friendly interfaces and integration tools make them accessible even for non-technical folks.\n\nThese public options offer limited control, less customization of model behavior and outputs and the potential for bias inherited from the pre-trained models.\n\nCustom-trained models: Most organizations can\u2019t produce or support artificial intelligence without a strong partnership. Innovators who want a custom AI can pick an AI foundation model like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 or BERT and feed it their data. This personalized training sculpts the model into bespoke generative AI perfectly aligned with the business goals. The process demands high-level skills and resources, but the results are compliant, custom-tailored and business-specific.\n\nThe best option for an enterprise organization depends on its specific needs, resources and technical capabilities. If speed, affordability and ease of use are priorities, ready-to-launch tools might be the best choice. Custom-trained models might improve if customization, control and bias mitigation are critical.",

Rometty took the reins at Big Blue eight years ago \u2014 at a time when IBM was undergoing immense transformation. She steered the company\u2019s strategy towards cloud computing, Watson and led IBM deeper into next-gen technologies Blockchain, AI, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.\n\nEven though Rometty will relinquish the CEO\u2019s chair in April, she will continue to serve as the Executive Chairman of IBM till the end of the year when she will complete forty years with the company.\n\nIn this article, we highlight Big Blue\u2019s hits and misses under Rometty\u2019s tenure:\n\na) The Fabled 22-Quarter Sales Drought\n\nUnder Rometty, IBM went through the infamous 22-consecutive quarter of revenue decline that lasted till 2018 and after the company recorded marginal revenue growth in a single quarter that year, its revenues slid again for five quarters in a row.\n\nIn terms of annual revenue, IBM earned $102,874 million ($102.87 billion) in the year Rometty took over as its CEO. But in subsequent years, its yearly revenue fell consistently, touching $79.13 billion in 2017 before rising by 0.57% in 2018 and then again falling by 4.03% in 2019 to finish the year at $77.13 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s Fortune 500 rankings under Rometty also fell remarkably from 19th in 2012, the year she took over, to 38th in 2019Opens a new window . The decline in the company\u2019s Fortune rankings occurred every year between 2012 and 2019 \u2013 a truly singular feat for a company that featured consistently in the top 10 between 1996 and 2006.\n\nLearn more: IBM Powers NexJ\u2019 Hybrid Cloud CRM Strategy\n\nb) Rometty Scored Well As the Perfect Role Model for Women\n\nThe financial setbacks aside, Romett found a place in the list of Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women in Business every single year since her appointment as CEO of IBM- finishing fourth in the list in 2018 and 2019 alongside well-known faces like GM\u2019s CEO Mary Barra, Lockheed Martin\u2019s CEO Marillyn Hewson, FIdelity CEO Abigail Johnson, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Anthem CEO Gail Boudreaux.\n\nIn 2019, Rometty also featured in Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s ten most powerful women \u2013 a list that included the likes of Angela Merkel, Christine Lagarde, Nancy Pelosi, Melinda Gates, and others.\n\nWhile her stature certainly commanded respect, it was not always salutations that came her way. While she featured in the TIME 100 list in 2012 and in the publication\u2019s list of the most important persons in tech in 2018, Rometty also found herself in unadmirable lists of the worst CEOs in the world created by the likes of The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Motley Fool, and 24/7 Wall Street.\n\nc) Big Blue Pivots From Hardware to Analytics, Cloud, Mobile & Security\n\nPossibly the greatest legacy of Rometty\u2019s eight-year stint with IBM as its CEO will be the wholesale shift from hardware to trending domains such as analytics, cloud, mobile and security, even at the cost of consistently declining revenues.\n\n\u201cMuch of the decline in revenue has been engineered by us. We restructured the hardware business and it is now less than 10 percent of the company, and we returned that business to profitability,\u201d Rometty said during an earnings call in 2015, adding that IBM was \u201cmaking significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM\u2019s business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.\u201d\n\nUnder Rometty, IBM sold its x86 low-end server business to Lenovo for $2.3 billion and its semiconductor chips business to semiconductor major GlobalFoundries with both deals resulting in the shrinking of the company\u2019s revenues from hardware. At the same time, the company made a series of acquisitions in analytics, cloud and mobile solutions domains to expand its offerings \u2060\u2014 most notably the acquisition of cloud computing infrastructure firm SoftLayer Technologies in 2013, analytics firm StoredIQ in 2012, Cloudant Inc in 2014, and cloud security firms Lighthouse and CrossIdeas in 2014. Last year, IBM completed its largest acquisition ever-snapping open source giant Red Hat for $34 billion .\n\nRometty hoped that IBM\u2019s expansion in cloud, data analytics, mobile and security domains would reap rich dividends in the long term, even though the same hurt the company\u2019s revenues in the short term. In 2015, she said IBM hoped to achieve $40 billion in sales from analytics, cloud, mobile and security by 2018, thereby increasing their share of overall revenue from 13% in 2010 to 45% in 2018.\n\nIn its latest earnings call on January 21, IBM said its fiscal 2019 revenues from cloud and cognitive software, global business services and global technology services touched $67.19 billion while revenues from its Systems division declined to just $7.6 billion, indicating that Rometty has, in fact, achieved what she aimed for.\n\nLearn more: IBM Gathers Tools and Tech into Cloud Migration Factory\n\nd) Renewed Focus on AI, Blockchain & IoT\n\nIn 2018, Rometty announced fresh plans for IBM in AI, blockchain and Internet of Things, stating that her company would create 1,800 jobs in these domains in France in partnership with various banks and financial organizations.\n\nUnder her watch, IBM also partnered with logistics giant Maersk to set up a shipping supply chain venture powered by blockchain, set up a Blockchain consortium named the Pharmaceutical Utility Network (PhUN) with Merck, Walmart, and KPMG, set up a blockchain system for Walmart to track suppliers of vegetables, and will roll out a blockchain contractor management solution named IBM Contingent Labor later in 2020.\n\nNow that Rometty has already kick-started IBM\u2019s fresh thrust in blockchain technologies and AI capabilities powered by IBM Watson , the company\u2019s investments and market share in these domains could rise in the future as Arvind Krishna, long-time IBMer is the lead strategizer of IBM in next-gen tech quantum computing, AI, blockchain, and nanotechnology.\n\nLet us know if you liked this news on LinkedInOpens a new window , TwitterOpens a new window , or FacebookOpens a new window .

Cisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Red Hat jointly sponsored the launch of the OASIS Data Provenance Standards Technical Committee, nonprofit organization OASIS Open said in an announcement.\n\nThe group will convene April 8 with the mandate to refine the data provenance standards codified by members of the Data and Trust Alliance and encourage widespread adoption.\n\nAmerican Express, Humana, IBM, Mastercard, Pfizer, UPS and Walmart were among the 19 D&TA affiliates that crafted version 1.0.0 of the standards, published in July 2024.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nData preparedness is an old problem that\u2019s reached a new level of urgency, as data-hungry generative AI applications increase the pace and scale of data consumption. The road to AI adoption is strewn with privacy, compliance and integration hurdles that remain hard to steer around.\n\n\u201cData governance is nothing new \u2014 people have been at this for a long time,\u201d Kristina Podnar, senior policy director at D&TA, told CIO Dive. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never had businesses come together to make it happen.\u201d\n\nStandardizing provenance protocols across vendors and industries can clear a path for better data quality management and tools that automate the validation process.\n\nThe alliance\u2019s framework defines a common metadata classification system to help organizations efficiently validate the quality and reliability of datasets for use in traditional analytics and AI business applications.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure any business across all industries can have visibility and transparency into the data that they're using,\u201d Podnar said.\n\nIn an unsettled regulatory environment, broad involvement is needed to create a trust benchmark for third-party data sources. Policy professionals want stronger guardrails around AI data, but most expect it be several years before governments can effectively intervene.\n\n\u201cThere has been much movement around adoption and regulating AI, yet we don\u2019t have standard definitions for its critical elements,\u201d Saira Jesani, D&TA executive director said in a July post announcing the organization\u2019s standards. \u201cThe consequences \u2014 from copyright infringement to privacy to authenticity \u2014 could affect both the technology\u2019s business value and its acceptance.\u201d\n\nIBM tested the standards internally last year, aligning the committee\u2019s recommendations with its governance policies. The company reported a \u201cconsistent and quantifiable impact on the overall efficiency of our data diligence and management processes,\u201d Christina Montgomery, chief privacy and trust officer at IBM, said in a November post.\n\nThe technical committee will look to improve on the existing standards while generating momentum for implementation tools. Podnar said she thinks the current version covers most but not all the standardization issues that should be addressed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 80% there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew that we didn't get this 100% right and that we were going to have to evolve the standards.\u201d\n\nOnce the technical committee convenes, the organization intends to bring additional members on board. The sponsoring companies are aiming to have metadata quality metrics ready for broad usage within 12 to 18 months, according to Podnar.\n\n\u201cThey're not interested in having this take a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want tools in the marketplace.\u201d",

            "content": "Tech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft are racing to develop fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n\nEach has released a prototype quantum chip with different approaches and potential applications.\n\nThe field is rapidly evolving, but major hurdles remain before it becomes commercially useful.\n\nThe quantum race is heating up.\n\nTech titans Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft each recently announced advancements in their prototype chips, tightening the race to develop a commercially useful quantum computer that could solve some of the universe's stickiest problems faster than a classical computer ever could.\n\nQuantum computing is a rapidly evolving \u2014 though still largely theoretical and deeply technical \u2014 field. But cracking it open could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods , among other outcomes, researchers say.\n\nNaturally, each of the major players in Big Tech wants to be the one to take quantum computing mainstream.\n\n\"You're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point,\" Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services, told Business Insider in late February, following the company's announcement of its Ocelot chip.\n\nStick with us \u2014 here's where it gets complicated.\n\nWhere classical computing uses binary digits \u2014 0s and 1s, called bits \u2014 to represent information, quantum computing relies on a foundation built from the quantum equivalent of bits, called qubits. When they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits allow quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.\n\nHowever, qubits are unstable, and their behavior is unpredictable. They require specific conditions, such as low light and extremely cold environments, to reduce errors. When the number of qubits is increased, the error rate goes up \u2014 making advancement in the field slowgoing.\n\nSmall-scale quantum computers already exist, but the race is on to scale them up and make them useful to a wider audience rather than just scientists.\n\nRecently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have announced new prototype chips, and IBM has made strides in its existing quantum road map. Each company is using unique approaches to solve the error reduction and scalability problems that have long plagued the field and make useful quantum computing a reality.\n\nHere's how each approach stacks up.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft's Majorana 1 chip is the first quantum computing chip powered by topological qubits. Microsoft\n\nApproach to quantum: Topological qubits\n\nMost powerful quantum processor: Majorana 1\n\nIn February, Microsoft unveiled its new quantum chip, Majorana 1. The aim is for the chip to speed up the development of large-scale quantum computers from decades to years.\n\nMicrosoft said the chip uses a new state of matter to produce \"topological\" qubits that are less prone to errors and more stable. Essentially, this is a qubit based on a topological state of matter, which isn't a liquid, gas, or solid. As a result, these quantum particles could retain a \"memory\" of their position over time and move around each other. Information, therefore, could be stored across the whole qubit, so if any parts fail, the topological qubit could still hold key pieces of information and become more fault-resistant.\n\n\"Microsoft's progress is the hardest to get an idea about because it's very niche,\" said Tom Darras, founder of quantum computing startup Welinq. \"Even experts in the industry find it difficult to assess the quality of these results.\"\n\nQuantum experts agree that Microsoft still has many roadblocks to overcome, and its peer-reviewed Nature paper only demonstrates aspects of what its researchers have claimed to achieve \u2014 but some in the quantum ecosystem see it as a promising outcome.\n\nRelated stories\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle researchers are aiming to reverse a long-standing qubit problem. Google\n\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\n\nMost powerful quantum processor: Willow\n\nIn December, Google announced Willow, its newest quantum chip, which the company claims takes just five minutes to solve a problem that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years.\n\nPerhaps more impressive was Google's breakthrough in how quantum computers scale. Historically, the more qubits that are added, and the more powerful the computer becomes, the more prone it is to errors. With Willow, Google's researchers said that adding more physical qubits to a quantum processor actually made it less error-prone, reversing the typical phenomenon.\n\nKnown as \"below threshold,\" the accomplishment marks a significant milestone by cracking a problem that has been around since the 1990s. In a study published in Nature, Google's researchers posit this breakthrough could finally offer a way to build a useful large-scale quantum computer. However, much of this is still theoretical, and now Google will need to prove it in practice.\n\nAmazon\n\nA superconducting-qubit quantum chip being wire-bonded to a circuit board at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing in Pasadena, Calif. Amazon Web Services\n\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\n\nMost powerful quantum processor: Ocelot\n\nIn late February, Amazon Web Services announced its Ocelot chip, a prototype designed to advance the company's focus on cloud-based quantum computing.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the Ocelot prototype demonstrated the potential to increase efficiency in quantum error correction by up to 90% compared to conventional approaches. The chip leverages a unique architecture that integrates cat qubit technology \u2014 named for the famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment \u2014 and additional quantum error correction components that can be manufactured using processes borrowed from the electronics industry.\n\nTroy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that Amazon's Ocelot chip is another building block that the industry will use to build a functioning quantum computer. However, its error rate needs to be substantially lowered, and its chips would require more qubit density before they're useful.\n\n\"There's lots of challenges ahead. What Amazon gained in error correction was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip,\" Nelson said. \"We're still in prototype days, and we still have multiple years to go, but they've made a great leap forward.\"\n\nIBM\n\nCES patrons take a look as IBM unveils this quantum computer, Q System One. Ross D. Franklin/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\n\nMost powerful quantum processor: Condor\n\nIBM has been a quantum frontrunner for some time, with several different prototype chips and its development of Q System One, the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, unveiled in January 2019, and has since been renamed IBM Quantum System One.\n\nIBM's Condor chip is the company's most powerful in terms of its number of qubits. However, since its development, IBM has focused its approach on the quality of its gate operations and making its newer quantum chips modular so multiple smaller, less error-prone chips can be combined to make more powerful quantum computing machines.\n\nCondor, the second-largest quantum processor ever made, was unveiled at the IBM Quantum Summit 2023 on December 4, 2023. At the same time, IBM debuted its Heron chip, a 133-qubit processor with a lower error rate. The latest Heron chip now has 156 qubits.\n\nRob Schoelkopf, cofounder and chief scientist of Quantum Circuits, told Business Insider that IBM has prioritized \"error mitigation\" over traditional error correction approaches. While IBM has so far been successful in what Schoelkopf calls \"brute force scaling\" with this approach, he said the methodology will need to be modified in the long run for efficiency.\n\nWho leads the race?\n\nSankar Das Sarma, a theoretical condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland, told Business Insider that the Amazon Web Services Ocelot chip, Google's Willow, and IBM's Condor use a \"more conventional\" superconducting approach to quantum development compared to other competitors.\n\nBy contrast, Microsoft's approach is based on topological Majorana zero modes, which also have a superconductor, but in \"a radically different manner,\" he said. If the Majorana 1 chip works correctly, Das Sarma added, it is protected topologically with minimal need for error correction, compared to claims from other tech companies that they have improved conventional error correction methods.\n\nStill, each company's approach is \"very different,\" Das Sarma said. \"It is premature to comment on who is ahead since the whole subject is basically in the initial development phase.\"\n\nBig Tech companies should be cautious about \"raising expectations when promoting results,\" said Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO of quantum computing startup Pasqal. \"Otherwise, you could create disillusionment.\"\n\nReymond's sentiment was echoed by IBM's VP of quantum adoption and business development, Scott Crowder, who told Business Insider he is concerned \"over-hype\" could lead people to discount quantum technology before its promise can be realized.\n\n\"We think we are on the cusp of demonstrating quantum advantage,\" said Crowder, referring to when a quantum computer outperforms classical machines. \"But the industry is still a few years from a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer.\"",

            "content": "Share this Post: WhatsApp Share\n\nBack in 2004, IBM\u2019s BlueGene/L was an undisputed giant in the world of supercomputing. With 32,768 PowerPC processors and a staggering 16 terabytes of memory, this cutting-edge machine topped the TOP500 list as the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer. It could perform 70.72 teraflops (TFLOPS), a mind-blowing achievement at the time.\n\nFast forward to 2025, and the landscape of high-performance computing has taken an unexpected turn. A single NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics card, originally designed for gaming, can now outperform BlueGene/L. This shift highlights just how far computing technology has advanced\u2014and how GPUs have evolved from simple gaming components into serious computational powerhouses.\n\nHow a Consumer GPU Surpassed a Supercomputer\n\nThe NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is the most powerful consumer GPU currently available. Designed primarily for gaming and AI applications, it has proven capable of handling computational workloads that were once the exclusive domain of multi-million-dollar supercomputers.\n\nWhat makes GPUs like the RTX 4090 so powerful today? The answer lies in parallel processing. Unlike CPUs, which handle a few complex tasks at a time, modern GPUs are optimized for executing thousands of operations simultaneously. This makes them ideal for AI, deep learning, and massive data computations\u2014tasks that supercomputers like BlueGene/L once dominated.\n\nA key factor in this shift is FP8 precision computing. While supercomputers traditionally relied on 64-bit floating point calculations (FP64) for extreme precision, today\u2019s AI applications prioritize speed over accuracy, making 8-bit floating point (FP8) an attractive alternative. This doubles the processing speed for AI-driven applications without significantly compromising results.\n\nWhy This Doesn\u2019t Mean GPUs Have Replaced Supercomputers\n\nWhile the RTX 4090 surpasses BlueGene/L in raw computational power, it\u2019s important to note that supercomputers and GPUs serve different purposes.\n\nIBM\u2019s BlueGene/L was designed for scientific simulations, climate modeling, and physics research\u2014tasks that require enormous memory capacity and specialized processing. It had 16 terabytes of RAM, while an RTX 4090 has just 24GB of GDDR6X memory. This means that while GPUs are faster for certain calculations, they cannot yet handle the massive datasets supercomputers were built for.\n\nAdditionally, supercomputers rely on complex networking architectures, allowing thousands of processors to communicate and work together efficiently. A single GPU, no matter how powerful, lacks the infrastructure to manage such interconnected computations at scale.\n\nThe Future: GPUs and Supercomputers Working Together\n\nRather than replacing supercomputers, GPUs are becoming essential components within them. Modern high-performance computing systems increasingly integrate GPU acceleration, blending the best of both worlds: the speed of GPUs with the memory and networking capabilities of traditional supercomputers.\n\nThe rise of AI and deep learning has made GPUs indispensable, and their impact is being felt across industries\u2014from medical research to materials science and even space exploration. As computing technology advances, it\u2019s clear that the future isn\u2019t about GPUs versus supercomputers, but rather how they can work together to push computational boundaries even further.\n\nSimilar Posts\n\n1.5/5 - (2 votes)\n\nShare this Post: WhatsApp Share",

We recently reported Lonestar was preparing to send the first physical data center (actually a RISC-V processor with a Phison SSD running Ubuntu) to the Moon, following the company's earlier success in testing the world\u2019s first software-defined data center on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nNow, IBM\u2019s Red Hat has announced a tie-up with Axiom Space to send a data center to the ISS in spring 2025. The Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) prototype will be powered by Red Hat Device Edge, an enterprise-grade version of MicroShift (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution derived from Red Hat OpenShift), along with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.\n\nAxDCU-1 will test applications in cloud computing, AI/ML, data fusion, and space cybersecurity on the space station while also demonstrating initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities.\n\nIn-space data processing\n\n\u201cOff-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component,\u201d said Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space, Red Hat. \u201cWith Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency.\u201d\n\nAxDCU-1 is part of Axiom Space\u2019s ongoing work to develop space infrastructure and will allow data to be processed closer to off-world sources, including spacecraft and satellites. The aim is to support more secure and faster decision-making in space.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the possibilities this collaboration with Red Hat enables for ODC infrastructure and the future of space operations. Infusing terrestrial-grade cloud solutions into ODCs will enable users to seamlessly transition and enhance their terrestrial workloads to orbit while leveraging the lower latency and increased security inherent with ODCs,\" said Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security at Axiom Space.\n\nAxiom Space says use cases for ODCs include in-space data processing for satellites, AI/ML training, cybersecurity, autonomy, space weather analytics, and off-planet backup for Earth's critical infrastructure.\n\nAre you a pro?

It has 32 Xeon cores and a 256GB cache providing 1-2ms latency, up to 200,000 IOPS, and 23GBps throughput. There is a fixed 24-slot configuration with 1.1PB raw capacity in a 2RU chassis. Because the system has always-on hardware-assisted compression, IBM says it has 2.3PB of effective capacity.\u201d\n\nAlongside FlashSystem grid scaling and a full suite of enterprise software functions, the C200 features eight onboard 10GbE ports and optional configurations of 16x 32Gb FC/NVMe-FC or 8x 25/10GbE NVMe-TCP ports. IBM says it delivers 10 times better performance than traditional HDD or hybrid solutions, making it optimized for sequential workloads.\n\n\"The writing really is on the wall for the last of the spinning rust\u2026\" IBM blogger Barry Whyte writes. \"Over the next few years we will see the price point for Flash get closer and closer, and eventually even reduce lower than NL-SAS. With 300, 500 and even 1PB Flash drives being teased in the industry, it's almost impossible for even the most advanced magnetic platter technologies to keep up.\"\n\nFlashSystem C200 has an indicative end-user price of $381,000, which Blocks & Files calls \u201crespectable,\u201d and it will be generally available worldwide on March 21.\n\nAre you a pro?

            "content": "Verizon, IBM, and Cisco are all cheap income plays in this frothy market.\n\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, investors often focus on glitzy growth plays that attract a lot of attention from Wall Street. However, all that buzz can drive the prices and valuations of those stocks to record highs -- which sets them up for steep drawdowns as elevated interest rates and other macro headwinds chill the market.\n\nAs the NASDAQ trades just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high, it might be smart to ignore the market darlings for now and buy a few blue chip tech stocks that trade at cooler valuations and pay healthy dividends. These three stocks fit that description: Verizon (VZ -0.82%), IBM (IBM 0.20%), and Cisco (CSCO 0.92%).\n\n1. Verizon\n\nVerizon's stock sank to a 13-year low of $28.25 on Oct. 13, 2023. At the time, the telecom giant was struggling to gain wireless customers and slashing its prices to stay competitive. But as of this writing, its stock has bounced back to nearly $44.\n\nVerizon's business recovered as it more than doubled its annual postpaid phone net additions in 2024. That acceleration was driven by the localization of its incentives and marketing campaigns, the expansion of its customizable \"myPlans,\" and the growth of its distribution business with Walmart. It also expanded its prepaid wireless segment by acquiring TracFone, while its total wireless churn rate declined 50 basis points to 1.62% for the full year. For 2025, it expects its wireless revenue to rise 2% to 2.8%. Analysts expect its total revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to both rise 2%.\n\nAs Verizon's wireless business warmed up again, it trimmed its spending to offset the pressure from its promotions. Its free cash flow (FCF) rose 6% to $19.8 billion last year and easily covered its $11.2 billion in dividend payments, and it still pays a forward yield of 6.3%. That high yield, along with its low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9, should limit its downside potential and make it a safe place to park your cash and earn some extra income.\n\n2. IBM\n\nIBM was once considered a stagnant tech giant that was left behind in the seismic shift toward cloud-based services. But under Arvind Krishna, its cloud chief who became its CEO in 2020, Big Blue's business gradually recovered.\n\nKrishna took over, IBM spun off its slow-growth managed IT infrastructure services business as Kyndryl, and expanded its open-source software subsidiary Red Hat's presence in the hybrid cloud and AI markets. Instead of going head-to-head against the public cloud giants, IBM aimed to carve out a niche with AI-powered services that could be wedged between the private and public clouds. It also pruned its workforce as it used AI to automate more tasks and trim its spending.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, IBM's revenue and EPS increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% and 1%, respectively. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but they represent a significant improvement after it endured years of top- and bottom-line declines. That's why its stock price more than doubled over the past three years.\n\nAnalysts expect its revenue and EPS to both grow about 4% this year as the macro environment stabilizes. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.7%. It only paid out 52% of its FCF over the past 12 months as dividends, so it still has plenty of room to raise its payout.\n\n3. Cisco\n\nCisco, one of the world's largest networking companies, struggled in fiscal 2021 and 2022 (which ended in July 2022) as supply chain constraints throttled its sales of routers, switches, and wireless networking devices. In fiscal 2023, its growth accelerated again as it resolved those supply chain issues and its customers ramped up their purchases of new networking hardware again.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Cisco's revenue and earnings both declined because many of its customers had accumulated too many of its products in the previous year -- and the intensifying macro headwinds throttled the deployment of those devices. As a result, its orders stalled out as its existing customers sat on too many uninstalled products.\n\nHowever, analysts expect Cisco's revenue to rise 5% in fiscal 2025 as it overcomes those inventory issues and ships more devices. They expect its adjusted EPS to stay nearly flat, but that pressure can mainly be attributed to its initial costs of integrating Splunk, the network observability services provider it acquired last March.\n\nCisco's stock still looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.6%. It only spent half of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months. Its business should stabilize after it fully laps its acquisition of Splunk and it normalizes its inventory levels -- so I believe it's still a reliable choice for conservative investors.",

It was supposedly an IBM machine and while IBM apparently provided some equipment (probably typewriters and tape drives), the computer is clearly just a ton of light bulbs. It was named Emmie, which was a nickname for EMERAC. Oddly enough, it was like a modern web search engine or chatbot, answering random research questions. The difference is they had fed all the world\u2019s knowledge into it themselves using punched cards.\n\nThe video has spoilers, but for a movie made in 1957, that\u2019s not really an issue.

EMERAC later guest-starred in the movie \u201cThe Fly.\u201d It was just a background player in the chorus, though.\n\nHe also points out that many of the things people thought about the widespread adoption of computers are still true today if you replace computer with AI.

            "content": "IBM (NYSE: IBM) recently announced the completion of its acquisition of HashiCorp, known for its products that automate and secure the infrastructure underpinning hybrid cloud applications and generative AI. IBM stated that the combined capabilities will help clients accelerate innovation, strengthen security, and derive more value from the cloud.\n\nHashiCorp\u2019s capabilities are expected to create significant synergies across IBM\u2019s strategic growth areas, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation, and Consulting. Rob Thomas, Senior Vice President, IBM Software and Chief Commercial Officer, emphasized IBM\u2019s commitment to investing in and growing HashiCorp\u2019s capabilities, aiming to \u201cinfuse HashiCorp technology in every data center\u201d by leveraging IBM\u2019s global reach and R&D resources alongside HashiCorp\u2019s leading technology and extensive developer community.\n\nDave McJannet, CEO of HashiCorp, highlighted HashiCorp\u2019s decade-long experience in helping large enterprises succeed in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. He expressed enthusiasm about expanding their reach with IBM\u2019s history, scale, and customer relationships to help their community automate, secure, and optimize their cloud infrastructure, offering an \u201cend-to-end platform for hybrid environments.\u201d Armon Dadgar, CTO and Co-founder of HashiCorp, noted HashiCorp\u2019s pioneering role in cloud infrastructure and the alignment of vision with IBM in enabling hybrid infrastructure for major enterprises, anticipating further investment in R&D innovation.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nThe acquisition comes at a time when nearly 75% of enterprises are utilizing hybrid cloud environments. These environments, encompassing public clouds and on-prem data centers, are seen as crucial for innovation through a consistent approach to infrastructure delivery and management at scale. The increasing demand for managing and modernizing cloud infrastructure and security tasks, coupled with the projection of one billion new cloud-native applications by 2028 driven by generative AI, necessitates infrastructure automation beyond human capacity.\n\nIn a recent discussion, William Lobig, VP of Product Management for IBM Automation, highlighted how HashiCorp is a \u201cperfect complement to our hybrid cloud strategy.\u201d He drew parallels between Red Hat OpenShift providing a virtualization platform for consistent application portability and HashiCorp offering the same for distributed infrastructure, application, and security management. Lobig noted that HashiCorp is a leader in security management and infrastructure, particularly with Terraform. He also pointed out the synergistic relationship between HashiCorp Terraform for infrastructure lifecycle management and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform for application configuration. \u201cWith HashiCorp being more for infrastructure lifecycle management, and then Ansible is more suited towards application configuration, we have infrastructure and platform deployment covered,\u201d Lobig explained.\n\nThe acquisition also builds upon IBM\u2019s existing portfolio of AI-driven IT automation capabilities aimed at optimizing IT spending and reducing costs. IBM\u2019s automation software includes AI-powered tools for application management insights, full IT stack observability, application resource management, and financial management solutions. Lobig indicated that a key focus in the coming year would be on \u201cbringing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and Terraform closer together\u201d to leverage the strengths of both technologies. He also mentioned the integration of IBM\u2019s FinOps, optimization, and observability tooling with HashiCorp\u2019s offerings, aiming to provide insights into the cost implications of infrastructure choices made by Terraform developers. The goal is to make the infrastructure building process more cost-aware, preventing budget overruns and fostering a proactive approach to cost management.\n\nHashiCorp\u2019s product portfolio, including Terraform and Vault, is now available through IBM\u2019s automation software portfolio. The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion, involved IBM acquiring all outstanding common shares of HashiCorp for $35 per share in cash. IBM, a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise, aims to leverage this acquisition to further empower clients in their digital transformations across various industries. Lobig emphasized that the combination of HashiCorp with Red Hat OpenShift and Ansible provides a \u201cholistic pipeline for code management of infrastructure and applications all the way up to the modern Kubernetes platform that those applications run on. It completes our hybrid story in that way.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Lobig sees \u201ca huge opportunity around more modern and visionary approaches to how cloud Asset Management is done\u201d. He envisions the development of \u201cinfrastructure graphs and application graphs\u201d to provide a real-time inventory of IT estates, enabling more effective application of cost, health, performance, and automated considerations. He also highlighted the potential for enhancing security by integrating Vault with IBM\u2019s network portfolio and expanding its capabilities for discovering and managing unmanaged infrastructure.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nHybrid is expected to be mainstay in global cloud computing strategies. \u200bIBM\u2019s pick-up of HashiCorp is another big bet that hybrid computing will underpin most companies\u2019 enterprise applications operating strategy. About three-quarters of organizations have implemented hybrid cloud models, combining both public and private cloud solutions, and by 2027, it\u2019s anticipated that 90% of organizations will have adopted a hybrid cloud approach, reflecting the growing importance of flexible cloud strategies. \u200bHybrid cloud infrastructure has seen significant growth in recent years, with projections indicating continued expansion. As of 2024, 94% of companies globally have integrated cloud computing into their operations. The hybrid cloud market is projected to reach $480.2 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 17.4% from 2024 to 2033. \u200bWorldwide spending on public cloud services is reached $805 billion in 2024 and is expected to double by 2028. \u200bBottom line is there is clearly an increasing reliance on hybrid cloud infrastructures, driven by the need for scalable, flexible, and efficient IT solutions.\n\nThe HashiCorp pick-up puts IBM on solid hybrid and AI ground. HashiCorp\u2019s suite of products, including Terraform for infrastructure as code and Vault for secrets management, complements IBM\u2019s existing offerings. This alignment is expected to strengthen IBM\u2019s position in hybrid cloud infrastructure and security lifecycle management. \u200bIBM plans to integrate HashiCorp\u2019s automation tools with its AI initiatives, potentially enhancing AI-driven application management and deployment. This synergy could lead to more efficient and scalable solutions for clients navigating complex cloud environments. \u200bThe acquisition faced investigations by regulatory bodies, including the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, reflecting concerns about market competition. However, the deal received necessary approvals, allowing it to proceed. \u200bSome industry pundits view the acquisition as a strategic move to solidify IBM\u2019s leadership in the Infrastructure as Code market. However, others caution that the integration process may present challenges, potentially diverting focus from other growth areas like AI software development. \u200bThe successful integration of HashiCorp into IBM\u2019s ecosystem is anticipated to enhance IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, offering clients comprehensive solutions for infrastructure automation and security. However, the long-term success of this acquisition will depend on effective integration strategies and the ability to maintain innovation within HashiCorp\u2019s product lines.\n\nTop 3 take-ways for CIOs. 1) HashiCorp\u2019s Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool, Terraform, will become more deeply integrated with IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud strategy. CIOs should expect enhanced automation capabilities, particularly for managing multi-cloud and hybrid environments across AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud. Assess how IBM\u2019s integration of Terraform, Vault (secrets management), and Consul (service networking) could improve cloud governance and reduce configuration drift in your organization. 2) HashiCorp Vault will bolster IBM\u2019s security offerings by improving secrets management, identity access, and compliance automation. This is critical for industries like finance, healthcare, and government, where data sovereignty, GDPR, and zero-trust security models are top priorities. CIOs should re-evaluate their identity and access management (IAM) frameworks and plan for deeper integration of Vault within their hybrid cloud security stack. 3) IBM\u2019s control over Terraform\u2019s ecosystem could lead to new licensing models, potential pricing changes, or deeper enterprise-grade features exclusive to IBM customers. Organizations relying on Terraform Open Source may see shifts in support and governance models, similar to how Red Hat handled open-source projects post-acquisition. CIOs should closely monitor changes in Terraform licensing and evaluate alternatives (e.g., OpenTofu) to ensure long-term flexibility in cloud infrastructure management.",

            "content": "The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has published a new patent from New York-based IT multinational International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Originally filed in August 2023, the document (US Patent No. 20250073998) outlines a novel method for transporting microparticles using 4D printed smart materials.\n\nAccording to IBM\u2019s filing, these 4D printed substances move in response to external stimuli like heat, light, magnetic fields, or electricity. Therefore, they can be configured and manipulated to deliver microparticles (1-100\u00b5m in diameter) from a starting point to a target location in small, hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe US tech giant\u2019s method uses a computer program to monitor the movement of the smart materials. If the 4D objects deviate from their intended path, machine learning models adjust the inputs to keep the microparticles on track. IBM highlights drug delivery, cell microcarriers, miniature electronics assembly, and micro-manufacturing as potential applications.\n\nIBM\u2019s AI Engineer Tushar Agrawal and Application Architect Sarbajit K. Rakshit, who helped invent the new 4D printing-enabled method, bring significant additive manufacturing pedigree. Agrawal has contributed to over 180 patent applications, including a proposal to 3D print objects from decomposable materials and monitor their breakdown over time. Rakshit, who possesses nearly two decades of IBM experience, was behind the company\u2019s hologram 3D printing patent filed in 2017.\n\nFormer IBM software developer Vinod A. Valecha is also named on the patent. Now working at San Jose tech firm Cohesity, he previously contributed to IBM\u2019s patent for continuous 3D printing with a collapsable build plate. Valecha also co-invented a \u201cparallelized additive manufacturing\u201d process that fabricates a deconstructed part simultaneously on multiple 3D printers. Su Liu, a \u201cMaster Inventor\u201d at IBM, is also named on the newly published 4D printing patent.\n\nThe IBM logo. Photo via IBM.\n\nIBM\u2019s new 4D printing patent\n\nIBM\u2019s 4D printing process begins when the computer program receives a user request to transport microparticles from a starting position to a target location along a specific path. Each request includes key characteristics like microparticle size, shape, weight, and material composition. The delivery path and environmental conditions must also be specified, with the small-scale smart printed material able to move through mediums spanning industrial environments, intestinal tracts, and arteries.\n\nIBM\u2019s program analyzes the request and uses ML models to design a 4D printable object optimized for microparticle delivery. Smart materials that can be used in these objects include shape-memory alloys and shape-memory polymers. Both can return to their original shape after being heated or deformed.\n\nIf the microparticles are small enough, they can be directly attached to the surface of the movable 4D object. However, for larger and heavier microstructures, IBM suggests rigid, 3D printed containers. These fasten to the smart materials and hold the microplastics during transportation.\n\nOnce triggered, IBM\u2019s program applies an external stimulus to activate the 4D object. The smart material responds by deforming and generating forces that enable movement. For example, heat causes shape-memory materials to bend or fold, while light triggers movement in photo-responsive materials. Magnetic fields can also be used to either attract or repel the 4D object, guiding its movement in a specific direction.\n\nIBM\u2019s patented process uses ML models to continuously monitor the 4D printed object as it moves along the delivery path. If any deviations or blockages are detected, the algorithm instantaneously analyzes the issue and adjusts the stimuli to correct its movement. Once it reaches the target location, IBM\u2019s program removes the external input, stopping movement and delivering the microparticles.\n\nAccording to the Silicon Valley tech leader, its newly published patent offers significant potential for several high-value applications. For instance, it could provide a precise method for targeted drug delivery by transporting medicine throughout the body to specific organs or tissues. Within the electronics sector, IBM\u2019s novel process could be used to assemble miniature electronic components with extreme precision. The smart materials can also move microparticles in small spaces where conventional manufacturing machines and robots can\u2019t reach, offering value for microfabrication.\n\nFlow charts representing IBM\u2019s new method. Image via the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n4D printing: a new dimension for additive manufacturing\n\n4D printing is by no means a new concept. Back in 2021, Researchers from China\u2019s Tianjin University developed a 4D printed soft robot capable of movement.\n\nThe tube-shape device was made of liquid crystal elastomer, which allowed it to self-assemble when subjected to heat. It was designed to leverage fold patterns to create strain within its structure, allowing it to roll and traverse flat surfaces. The 4D printed robot also demonstrated the ability to climb a 20\u00b0 incline and drag a load up to 40 times its own weight.\n\nA team of German, Egyptian, and UAE-based researchers also developed a novel method to create 4D printed dental aligners with memory capabilities. DLP-printed from Kline Europe\u2019s transparent ClearX resin, the orthodontic device is designed to soften once inserted into a user\u2019s mouth. This allows the aligner to adapt to, grip, and reposition misaligned teeth. The researchers demonstrated an ability to predictably change the aligners\u2019 properties over time, making it a sustainable alternative to single-use dental products.\n\nElsewhere, a team from Queen\u2019s University Belfast developed personalized 4D printed breast implants to manage and treat cancer. According to the researchers, this was the first time 4D printing was used to produce breast cancer implants.\n\nUsing this process, the Northern Ireland-based scientists fabricated multipurpose breast implants that can be programmed to change size to better fit into the patient\u2019s tissue cavity. This reportedly unlocks greater personalization and improved aesthetic outcomes. The 4D printed implants can also be programmed to release chemotherapy drugs where they are needed, protecting against the return of cancer cells.\n\nWho won the 2024 3D Printing Industry Awards?\n\nSubscribe to the 3D Printing Industry newsletter to keep up with the latest 3D printing news.\n\n\n\nYou can also follow us on LinkedIn, and subscribe to the 3D Printing Industry Youtube channel to access more exclusive content.\n\n\n\nFeatured image shows the IBM logo.

Today, we\u2019re excited to share the new IBM SkillsBuild university strategy to strengthen AI education in universities, helping them cultivate talent among future developers, and drive economic growth worldwide.\n\nToday\u2019s skills gap presents an obstacle to innovation and economic development. The demand for AI skills is a top priority for companies, universities and learners, due to mass adoption of AI, the rise of open-source AI models available for the general public and the new proliferation of AI assistants and agents. In fact, the latest Future of Jobs report from the World Economic Forum shows that the skills gap remains the most significant barrier to business transformation, and that by 2030, 39% of current skills may become outdated. Developers face a similar challenge according to recent research from IBM and Morning Consult. For example, 76% of developers surveyed say they don\u2019t consider themselves to be experts in generative AI. This trend is likely to continue and the skills gap would grow at the same accelerated pace. To foster the technical talent needed to fuel open innovation and drive business results, we need to invest in the skills of our future workforce.\n\nHow can IBM support students and aspiring developers? In 2023, IBM announced a commitment to providing free AI training to 2 million learners worldwide over three years. When we undertook this work, we knew that different groups of learners would have different needs, and that cross-industry alignment on how to approach this global challenge would be required. To help address this, we co-created an AI competencies guide through the AI Alliance. We worked to collect data, generate insights, and align on recommendations to define the essential AI competencies across key sectors and roles, as well as a defined range in levels from fluency, to proficiency, to expertise, and finally mastery.\n\nBuilding on this AI Alliance framework guidance, we have created a new strategy to help university students and aspiring developers build the AI competencies that will help them thrive. The key elements of this work are faculty training, online learning, hands-on labs, group innovation challenges, as well as practical real-world learning opportunities. Each of our student-facing offerings is developed for key personas, to respond to their needs and help them build their AI competencies to reach their goals, and all are available through our IBM SkillsBuild program.\n\nFaculty Training: Our starting point to deepen IBM\u2019s relationships with universities is connecting with professors to offer AI training and resources that can help them cultivate their students\u2019 abilities. This approach multiplies the impact of our training, helping us reach a much wider audience of learners. To this end, we\u2019re rolling out enhanced training for professors with new coursework on generative AI. Meanwhile, we will also provide faculty at select universities with access to IBM solutions like watsonx, (our portfolio of generative AI products) and Granite (our family of open-source large language models (LLMs)). The additional guidance and support from IBM experts will offer professors more options to incorporate advanced AI learning into their curriculum.\n\nOur starting point to deepen IBM\u2019s relationships with universities is connecting with professors to offer AI training and resources that can help them cultivate their students\u2019 abilities.

These interactive exercises are up to 90 minutes in length and will help students dive deeper into topics like code generation and data classification using LLMs, like IBM Granite. Students will also have the opportunity to earn digital credentials that are recognized by future employers. Capstone projects and group innovation challenges: IBM is making watsonx available to selected universities for students to build real-world solutions. This offering will be targeted to advanced technical undergraduate or graduate students. These students will have the opportunity to work with IBM experts and their classroom professors, to build innovative capstone projects over the course of a semester. IBM mentors will equip the students with problem statements, including some from IBM clients, which could span different industries such as financial services, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, manufacturing, telecommunications, marketing or energy. Groups of students at this level could also participate in innovation challenges, like hackathons, which are short-term experiences that give groups of aspiring developers the opportunity to use generative AI and LLMs, like Granite.\n\nResults of our pilots around the world:\n\nAs we\u2019ve piloted this approach around the world, we have already seen some early success stories. For example, through IBM SkillsBuild, two teams of university students in Boston built a chatbot using IBM\u2019s generative AI technology. The tool aims to help students explore if their work outside the traditional college environment could be applied for college credit. Additionally, students in India have built watsonx solutions focused on the legal profession, farming, and nutrition. And in the UK, we worked with a team of students who built a disaster-response robot using IBM\u2019s AI and data platform technology. Equipped with advanced sensors and a virtual assistant, built from scratch using IBM watsonx, the robot would assess its environment, identify obstacles, connect with individuals on the ground, and send important information back to rescue teams, making it a valuable asset during critical moments.\n\nLooking ahead:\n\nThe pace of AI innovation continues to challenge and inspire businesses across industries, making skilled talent even more important than ever. As we see the rise of more open-source AI models, it\u2019s clear that the pace of transformation is not slowing down. The future of AI will be shaped by students, educators, and professionals who not only have the skills to use generative AI, but also to manage AI agents, or even build them.\n\nIn the months ahead, we\u2019re excited to expand our work with more schools and learners across disciplines to build AI skills. We will continue to:\n\nenhance our resources for university faculty, including opportunities to connect across the faculty community,\n\nexpand our catalog of new AI coursework for students, and\n\nconnect with teams across universities to build new innovative AI and open source solutions.\n\nTogether with universities and our network of IBM SkillsBuild partners, we are investing in the pipeline of technological talent for our future, and preparing them for the marketplace.\n\nIf you\u2019re a student, visit the IBM SkillsBuild site.\n\nIf you\u2019re a university or faculty and would like to participate or learn more, please visit https://skillsbuild.org/organizations-supporting-college-students/interest-form.",

            "content": "With a decade at IBM, she held key roles including marketing lead for West Africa and strategy lead for Central, East, and West Africa. A member of the Forbes Technology Council, Angela is also a strong advocate for women's empowerment and philanthropy, mentoring women in business and supporting underprivileged communities in rural Ghana.\n\nShe's a Harvard Business School alumna and a devoted mother of two boys. This International Women's Day, we put a spotlight on Angela Kyerematen-Jimoh.\n\nQ: Hello, Angela. How are you?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGood morning. I'm fantastic.\n\nQ: Every morning, what time do you wake up?\n\nMy alarm goes off at 5 AM. I take my mornings slow, say my prayers, reset my mind, and practice gratitude. It helps me focus for the day. I also do some stretching because the body and mind are connected. I alternate between cardio and weight training.\n\nQ: For those who don\u2019t know, where did Angela grow up?\n\nI was born in Accra. My mother was a teacher and headmistress of St.Monica\u2019s Secondary School in Asante Mampong. I grew up in a very disciplined environment, living on campus. I later attended Wesley Girls\u2019 High School for my O Levels and then Achimota School for my sixth form.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter my A Levels, I did a year abroad through the American Field Service (AFS) exchange program in Belgium. That\u2019s where I learned to speak French fluently.\n\nQ: At what point in your education did you decide on your career path?\n\nIn university, I was already married and had my first child, Jamal, in my first year. I always had an interest in marketing, so I pursued that and added French to my studies. By the time I graduated, I had two children.\n\nQ: Tell us about your marriage journey.\n\nI got married very early\u2014at 19 or 20\u2014to a very handsome Nigerian man. We had a good marriage, but unfortunately, things didn\u2019t work out. I was young and had different priorities. I\u2019ve learned a lot from my marriage and divorce, and I use those lessons to mentor young women. Everything happens for a reason. My sons, Jamal and Caleb, have grown into wonderful men\u2014one an engineer, the other a legal technologist.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nQ: How has your experience shaped your perspective on life?\n\nEven though I see my marriage as a failure, it has taught me valuable lessons. It has made me a better person and mentor. Yesterday, one of my mentees called me in tears because she\u2019s going through a separation. I used my experience to guide her, helping her avoid the mistakes I made. Everything in life happens for a reason, and we must learn from it.\n\nBI Africa\n\nQ: Now, Angela, let's talk about your career. I know you're into banking, even before I get to the conversation on how you got into tech, how did you get into banking?\n\nSo, when I finished my degree, my first job after my degree was working for a software company called GL Trade. GL Trade is a company that was responsible for the trading software for stock exchange traders. We were selling this solution to the banks, the investment banks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd then one of my clients who was working at ABN AMRO approached me during an event and said, \"Hey, would you like to join our team?\" And I did marketing and front. You know, when you're a marketer, you can sell anything. And I think that marketing was a very good foundation for me to now leverage and grow into different, it doesn't restrict you to one industry.\n\nI accepted the offer and I ended up working at ABN AMRO Futures and Options desk for a while. We were responsible for selling the futures and options capabilities to hedge fund managers in the UK.\n\nSo, and then, UBS Investment Bank bought the ABN AMRO Futures and Options, so I ended up moving to UBS Investment Bank. And then from UBS Investment Bank, I relocated. I came back to Africa, I came back to Ghana, So UBA, I was head of Prestige Banking. I did that for a while and then I moved to GT Bank as head of Corporate Banking for GT Bank.\n\nQ: So how did tech come in?\n\nSo again, interesting, a client of mine when I was working at GT Bank, called me. He was the head of General Electric at that time in Ghana. Leslie called me and told me about IBM coming into Ghana and they were looking for a strong marketing person to head their operations in West Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd initially, I was a bit reluctant. I was like, \"Why technology? I mean, I don't know anything about technology.\" And Leslie was like, \"You know what, I think technology, you will do well in technology. I've known you for a while. I think you're very smart and you will learn it, and technology is the future. So I think you should at least have a conversation with them and we can take it from there.\"\n\nAnd then I went home. I'm very close to my mom. So I went home that time, and I asked my mom, and my mom actually encouraged me to move into technology because she also believed that technology had become a way of life.\n\nAnd since I had been complaining about getting stuck in the banking industry and not knowing where I was going with all of that, I wanted something different and I wanted a challenge.\n\nSo I then moved into technology, and I knew that if I was going to move into technology, I had to roll up my sleeves. I had to do a lot of courses. I had to bring myself up to speed. And being in the marketing team, running the marketing team for West Africa for IBM also gave me the chance to learn a lot about technology.\n\nThe good thing about OEMs like Microsoft and IBM is it's a university on its own. They allow you to do a lot of courses, and you don't get stuck in one place. You can do different roles. So when I moved into IBM, I started in marketing as head of marketing for West Africa. And then I moved on to become the strategy lead for Central, East, and West Africa for IBM.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo that took me to Nairobi, Kenya, and that's when I moved with the boys to Nairobi, Kenya. So I did the marketing role for, I think, two years, and then I moved to the strategy role, which also helped me to work very closely with the team in the US on the strategy for Africa. So I did that for I think two years, and then the opportunity came for me to now move to Ghana as the first woman Country General Manager for IBM.\n\nBI Africa\n\nQ: Being the first woman, how did you feel?\n\nDo you know, actually, when the announcement was made, I was still in Kenya. And then I woke up one morning, and my cousin called me and was like, \"Oh, you're all over the news.\" I'm like, \"Why? What did I do?\" And he goes, \"Oh, you've been appointed, and you're actually the first female.\"\n\nAnd then it did strike that, yes, I mean, looking at the history of IBM, they've never really used a woman as a country manager. I took over from a very respectable man, Mr. Joe Mensah, who is now the CEO of Kosmos. And I had very big shoes to fill because he's a chief. He's very well respected. And I used to look at him and I think, wow, you know, I have really big shoes to fill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo I made a joke. I used to tell him, \"OK, you have big shoes, but you know what? I'm gonna add heels to it .\n\nSo I got my own touch to the role. And, how did I feel? It didn't even strike. It didn't hit me until later on when people started talking about, \"Oh, she's the first woman, she's the first woman\" that it did actually sink in that I was the first woman. But, like I said, I sometimes forget I'm a woman, you know, so I just focused on how do we get this work done?\n\nAnd, you know, the good thing about these roles, it's not all up to you. It's about the team that you build. And I was blessed to have a really good team.\n\nQ: At what point did Microsoft come in?\n\nSo I went to the US. I worked for the senior vice president for global markets as the chief of staff for I think one year and a half, almost two years, and then I was brought to Africa to head Africa for IBM.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI was responsible for 35 countries in Africa, including Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco, Kenya. I think I was running the entire Africa except Egypt and South Africa. So Africa was divided into three. We had Egypt that stood on its own, South Africa that stood on its own, and then the rest of Africa. So I was the CEO for the rest of Africa.\n\nI did that for, I think, almost two years, and then I moved to Microsoft.\n\nI got a call from Microsoft that they were starting this Africa Transformation Office. They wanted me to join as the strategic partnership lead for Africa. I learned a lot from that, and I think all the lessons I gained at Microsoft during my time as the strategic partnership lead have really helped me in starting Brainwave AfricaTech. And here we are.\n\nQ: Let's talk about Brainwave Tech. From Microsoft, was it right after that, or before you left, were you already making plans to start your own?\n\nBrainwave AfricaTech is only a few months old. I started Brainwave in January this year, 2025. I opened the office sometime in mid-January, but this whole idea started when I was at Microsoft. I got to a point in my career where I needed a new direction, and everything pointed to the fact that I needed a change. I was waiting on God and asking, \"What\u2019s next for me?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI\u2019ve never really wanted to be an entrepreneur, but one day, while praying and talking to God, I had a brainwave. The Holy Spirit was very clear\u2014it was time for me to start my own company. I would still be working with IBM and Microsoft, but as a business partner. That\u2019s why I call it Brainwave Africa Tech. The moment I entertained that thought, I was at peace.\n\nQ: For those who don\u2019t know, what\u2019s the focus of Brainwave?\n\nBrainwave Africa Tech\u2019s mission is to be the partner of choice for Africa\u2019s digital transformation. However, we choose to do this through collaboration. One of the things we are doing very well is building strategic partnerships with Microsoft and IBM.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned while working at Microsoft as the head of strategic partnerships for the Africa Transformation Office was how to approach strategic partnerships. Even though we are just a month old, we have already been the successful bidder for one of the biggest multi-million-dollar RFPs in Ghana.\n\nIt was made possible through strategic partnerships with one of the best implementation partners, Blue Dive, based in Nigeria. They are more or less like a sister company to me.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI\u2019m also starting a project called the AI Explorers Club, targeting children aged 8 to 15. Every Friday or Saturday, they come to this office for AI training. We focus on AI fundamentals, and my idea is that we need to get children excited about AI early. AI is here to stay, and the sooner we prepare them, the better.\n\nQ: This is a lot! From home to here, as a woman, how do you juggle all of this?\n\nWhen I walked in, I got a call from my son in the UK. I had to play mom\u2014but a strict mom! They\u2019re grown-up boys, but they still need a bit of direction sometimes.\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve learned as a mother is to allocate the right time for everything. I delegate a lot. I have a solid support system\u2014from my driver to my housekeeper.\n\nQ: Can women have it all?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirst, you have to define what \"all\" means for you. I don\u2019t allow society to define my \"all\" because if I do, I\u2019ll constantly be chasing things. About 10\u201315 years ago, I decided I wouldn\u2019t live by society\u2019s standards. At every stage, I define what \"my all\" is.\n\nRight now, my \"all\" is waking up healthy, having a roof over my head, running a one-month-old business that\u2019s thriving, knowing my boys and my mom are doing well\u2014those are my \"all.\" So yes, I have it all. My advice to women: don\u2019t let society define \"your all.\" Define it for yourself, work toward it, and you will find contentment.\n\nQ: As a woman, did you face any challenges in the corporate world?\n\nAbsolutely. I\u2019ve faced a lot of challenges, but they have shaped me into who I am today. Challenges make you grow. You never grow in your comfort zone. For you to thrive, you have to step out of your comfort zone, and challenges push you into that space. Every time I face a challenge, I see it as an opportunity to grow. I know there is always a solution because I have a higher force looking out for me and guiding me to greater things.\n\nQ: Women in leadership in Africa\u2014what\u2019s your view on representation? Have we made enough progress?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA lot of women are doing well, but I also think the media doesn\u2019t do a great job of spotlighting them. Many accomplished women are hidden in their corners. My challenge to the media is this: do you highlight these women? Or does bad news sell better?\n\nThere has been significant change. Gone are the days when we celebrated \"first female country manager\" as a big deal. It\u2019s not a big deal anymore\u2014there are many women excelling in various fields. My question to the media is: do you consider that newsworthy? Are you highlighting these stories?\n\n\"You know, I don't think stories like that really sell in Africa. We need to change the narrative. We need to start selling good stories about good things that women are doing, and by doing that, you realize that there are a lot of women out there doing great stuff that we need to help.\"\n\nQ: Now, the theme for this year's International Women's Day is 'Accelerate Action.' As a woman and a leader, what does this theme mean to you and how do you plan on implementing action in the fields that you find yourself in?\n\n\"Accelerate action means, for me, it's all about collaboration, right? So like I said in the beginning, one of the things that I learned from my role at Microsoft as a strategic partnership lead is looking at how I can collaborate with people to accelerate action. So it's all about partnership.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI told you about the Saturday class that I'm doing for young children on AI. I went out and I looked for a young company.They have a good solution, but they are in their little corner doing their stuff. And I thought, OK, let me use my brand, pull them in, and help accelerate action by collaborating with them.\n\nSo for me, it's all about collaboration. You don't have to reinvent the wheel to accelerate action. You can accelerate action by collaborating and forging strong strategic partnerships with others who are doing different things. Together, we can go far.\"\n\nQ: Now if you look back, what advice do you wish you had gotten 10-20 years ago that would have made a difference?\n\n10-20 years ago, I wish I had believed in myself more. The way I can comfortably talk about my unbreakable faith in myself now, I wish I had that 10 or 15 years ago. I wish I had believed in God more. I wish I had a stronger relationship with God at that time, like I do now, because I think a lot of things would have been different. I would have made different decisions, but in all, we still give thanks.\n\nQ: Now, wrapping up, there are a lot of women who look up to you. Some people want to be entrepreneurs and go into tech. What advice would you give to these women?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirst, have unbreakable faith in who you are. Practice gratitude, and in all things, believe in God. Believe in God.\n\nThank you so much for joining us.",

Per the renewed agreement, IBM aims to integrate its watsonx platform with Juniper\u2019s Mist AI (artificial intelligence) to address the complexities of managing IT networks and help improve user experiences and lower operational costs.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the companies will work in unison on two internal IBM projects, namely IBM Guest Services and IBM AskNetwork. IBM Guest Services intends to help automate IT network support services and minimize manual intervention to resolve guest Wi-Fi network issues. IBM AskNetwork, on the other hand, will help resolve network infrastructure problems and diagnose end-user issues by simplifying complex technical data into consumable, actionable insights.\n\n\n\nIn addition to providing personalized support to each user in real-time, the extended tie-up will free up IT resources and empower end users with instant, accurate resolutions. This is likely to improve efficiency and help unlock new opportunities to stay ahead in the competitive business landscape.\n\nWatsonx Platform: IBM\u2019s Key Growth Driver\n\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning, the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lake house architecture and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\n\nSolid Hybrid Cloud Demand: IBM\u2019s Strength\n\nIBM\u2019s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has translated into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions, translating into an uptrend in revenues in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe buyout of HashiCorp has further augmented IBM\u2019s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp\u2019s tool sets complement IBM RedHat\u2019s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HashiCorp\u2019s cloud software capabilities has bolstered IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach. The acquisitions of StreamSets and webMethods have also improved IBM\u2019s AI platform and automation capabilities, bringing together key competencies in integration, API management and data ingestion. Complementing IBM DataStage and Databand platform with a hybrid and multi-cloud approach, the buyouts have enabled IBM to develop comprehensive application and data integration platforms in the industry.",

            "content": "Melinda French Gates credited a conversation with an IBM hiring manager for her decision to join Microsoft, a choice that significantly impacted her career and personal life.\n\nWhat Happened: French Gates narrated her career-defining story to LinkedIn News. After two successful summer internships, she had a job offer from IBM on the table. However, a crucial conversation with her hiring manager led her to contemplate a different path, reported Business Insider. \u201cThis little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,\u201d she remembered saying. The manager\u2019s response was, \u201cIf they give you an offer, you should take it.\u201d\n\nFrench Gates heeded the advice and joined Microsoft as a product manager in 1987, post her graduation from Duke University\u2019s business school. She spent nearly ten years at Microsoft, rising to the designation of general manager and managing the company\u2019s information products. She also met her ex-husband, Bill Gates, during this period in Microsoft.\n\nAfter leaving Microsoft in 1996, French Gates co-founded the Gates Foundation with Bill Gates in 2000. She stepped away from the foundation in May and currently dedicates her efforts to Pivotal Ventures, the investment and incubation company she founded in 2015.\n\nSEE ALSO: Marvell Surpasses AI Chip Sales Target, Aims Higher For 2026, But Stock Plunges Due To Muted Guidance\n\nWhy It Matters: While at Microsoft, French Gates can be credited for developing multimedia products like Microsoft Cinemania, Word, Publisher and Expedia.com. Her career trajectory is also marked by significant contributions to philanthropy. In 2024, she announced a $250 million fund to enhance women\u2019s health, highlighting her primary focus post her tenure at the foundation.\n\nMoreover, Warren Buffett, who was a trustee of the Gates Foundation, has expressed his admiration for French Gates. Buffett praised her vision, stating, \u201cIn terms of seeing the whole picture, she\u2019s smarter.\u201d He also referred to her as a \u201clongtime friend.\u201d\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

Moores could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Sam TobinEditing by Bernadette Baum and Tomasz Janowski)",

            "content": "President Trump will reportedly meet with top U.S. tech companies facing tariff-related pressure.\n\nThe CEOs of IBM, Intel, Qualcomm and HP will gather at the White House on Monday (March 10), Bloomberg News reported Thursday (March 6), citing sources familiar with the matter and a spokesperson for HP.\n\n\u201cSome of the topics top-of-mind for our leadership team are trade policy and U.S. manufacturing,\u201d that spokesperson said.\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, the Trump administration is pushing several policy changes that could threaten computer hardware makers. For example, new tariffs on manufacturing centers like China could drive up costs and hinder supply chains.\n\nIn addition, the report added, tech companies are also seeking clarity about possible restrictions on their exports of technology for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which are being constructed around the globe.\n\nThe meeting is happening as businesses from a range of sectors are feeling pressure from the tariffs, imposed on Canada, Mexico and China and covering a range of goods.\n\nFor example, a report Wednesday (March 5) by the Wall Street Journal found that toy companies are bracing themselves for the impact of the tariffs. These companies are concerned about where they will source their products, how they will stay on top of growing costs and how consumers will react to higher prices.\n\nWhile some larger toymakers are renegotiating with vendors and shifting production to other countries, smaller companies have fewer options and could be forced to absorb the added costs if they cannot pass them along to buyers in the form of higher prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Best Buy said earlier this week that tariffs on China could have a negative effect of about one point of comparable sales if they stayed in place for a full year.\n\n\u201cWhile Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,\u201d CEO Corie Barry said during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that at least 60% of CFOs see their companies facing greater uncertainty and challenges due to the tariffs.\n\n\u201cReconfiguring supply chains is no panacea, as it costs time and money,\u201d PYMNTS wrote recently. \u201cMoreover, domestic supply chains would become more competitive, as near-shoring or onshoring materials would mean greater competition for suppliers on higher demand and, thus, supply crunches.\u201d",

It was tiny. She said, \u2018If they give you an offer, you should take it.\u2019 And it dumbfounded me. Here's this woman who's supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates ' ex-wife Melinda French Gates revealed an important piece of advice she received early in her career. During a recent interview, she said that this advice \u2014which was to forgo a stable job at IBM for a small startup that later became Microsoft \u2014 helped in her journey to becoming a billionaire. Gates mentioned that she got this advice from an IBM supervisor who made this suggestion despite the company\u2019s interest. This made Gates leave a senior position at IBM to join the then-nascent Microsoft, where she spent nine years and played an important role in the company\u2019s growth. She rose to the position of general manager of information products at Microsoft, which is now a $3.1 trillion tech giant.In an interview with LinkedIn (shared by Fortune), which is available only to the professional networking platform\u2019s premium subscribers, Gates said:While the move to Microsoft on the West Coast required uprooting her life, the appeal of being part of something potentially groundbreaking was irresistible, Gates added.\u201cI didn't know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, \u2018I want to be part of that,\u2019\u201d she continued.During the interview she even encouraged others to embrace similar leaps of faith in their careers, emphasising that taking risks can lead to exceptional achievements.\u201cI remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. You can go over here. It's not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,\u201d Gates added.Gates is now among the top ten richest women in the US with a net worth of $15.2 billion. She also noted that this outcome may not have been the same had she not acted on the advice to choose a startup over IBM, which was an established corporation at that time.",

Fine tune and OTA updates: Continuously improve model and deploy\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve into how the available tools support critical steps in the three phases described above in more detail:\n\n1: Data Preparation\n\nIBM watsonx.data enhances data preparation for AI workloads in industrial edge environments by providing a unified platform that can manage diverse data types from IoT devices, machinery, and sensors at the edge. Its architecture enables efficient data collection and processing directly at edge locations, minimizing latency and ensuring real-time data consistency across operational processes. By supporting open data formats and machine learning libraries, watsonx.data allows data scientists and engineers to prepare AI models at the edge, driving rapid insights for asset optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring.\n\na) Exploring Data: The Data manager module in IBM watsonx.data allows you to browse, search, and manage schemas and tables by engine, viewing associated catalogs and tables. You can also create schemas and configure tables directly from the web console using Data Definition Language (DDL) commands.\n\nb) Ingesting Data: Data ingestion allows users to import and load data through the UI, object storage, or CLI, supporting formats like IBM Storage Ceph, AWS S3, and MinIO. The process can be done securely via the Ingest data tab, web console, or CLI, enabling optimized file formats and SQL querying capabilities with Presto.\n\nSample CLI command to ingest parquet file:\n\nibm-lh data-copy --source-data-files SOURCE_DATA_FILE \\ --staging-location s3://lh-target/staging \\ --target-tables TARGET_TABLES \\ --ingestion-engine-endpoint INGESTION_ENGINE_ENDPOINT \\ --dbuser DBUSER \\ --dbpassword DBPASSWORD \\ --create-if-not-exist\n\nc) Querying Data: SQL queries can be run through the Query workspace interface, supporting data manipulation and visualization with tools like Visual Explain for query execution plans. The Visual Explain feature validates SQL queries and displays execution details in graphical formats, while Query History tracks and audits all past and current queries. The Query History Monitoring and Management (QHMM) service manages diagnostic data, storing query histories and events.\n\nimport prestodb # Get connection object presto_conn = prestodb.dbapi.connect( host = env.PRESTO_HOST, port = env.PRESTO_HOST_PORT, user = env.PRESTO_USER, catalog = env.PRESTO_CATALOG, schema = env.PRESTO_SCHEMA, http_scheme = 'https', auth = prestodb.auth.BasicAuthentication(env.PRESTO_USER, env.PRESTO_PASSWORD) ) #Time series query query = \"SELECT * from operations_store.iot_sensor_data \\ WHERE io_timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP '2024-05-09 17:00:00.000' AND TIMESTAMP '2024-05-09 20:12:00.000'\" cursor = presto_conn.cursor() cursor.execute(query) # Fetch and print the results data = cursor.fetchall() cursor.close()\n\n2: Model and application development\n\na. Model Development\n\nwatsonx.ai offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline the model development process for AI. It enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy models with ease, leveraging robust machine learning libraries and frameworks. It provides features for model monitoring, version control, and performance optimization, making it a powerful platform for developing sophisticated AI models. watsonx is fully integrated with IBM's cloud infrastructure, hence, ensures scalable compute power and storage. Worth noting is IBM's open collaboration multi-cloud strategy allowing to utilize other cloud services providers (AWS, Azure) as well.\n\nb. Model Fine Tuning\n\nInstructLab allows users to contribute to Large Language Models (LLMs) without needing advanced AI/ML expertise. It overcomes the challenges high entry barriers, simplifying the process of enhancing generative AI. Through community-driven governance and best practices, InstructLab makes model contributions more accessible and supports regular updates to open-source models without full retraining. IBM\u2019s Granite Model Series with lower parameter counts are prime candidates to be used as student models for training and developing the models for edge use cases.\n\nTaxonomy based skill and knowledge representation\n\nThe taxonomy creation process for InstructLab involves structuring skills and knowledge contributions into a hierarchical tree with YAML files at the end nodes. Contributors can define skills (e.g., grounded or ungrounded) by creating a qna.yaml file with examples of questions, answers, and optional contexts, alongside an attribution.txt file citing sources. For knowledge contributions, a repository of Markdown files supports detailed contextual information linked through qna.yaml. The taxonomy leverages synthetic data alignment for Large Language Models (LLMs) and organizes content into cascading directories based on domains and subdomains, ensuring clarity and ease of model tuning.\n\nCheck the GitHub taxonomy repo for information.\n\nSynthetic Data Generation\n\nInstructLab leverages taxonomy-defined skills or knowledge to create datasets using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate synthetic data. Run the ilab data generate command, using GPU acceleration if available, to create synthetic data. The pipeline can be customized to use alternative models or endpoints for generation. The generated dataset is saved in JSONL format within the datasets directory, named skills_train_msgs_.jsonl and knowledge_train_msgs_.jsonl, depending on the type of contribution. Confirm the dataset creation by inspecting the output directory using the ls datasets command.\n\nilab data generate \\ --pipeline full \\ --sdg-scale-factor 100 \\ --endpoint-url http://localhost:8080/v1 \\ --output-dir ./outputdir-watsonxai-endpoint \\ --chunk-word-count 1000 \\ --num-cpus 8 \\ --model ibm/granite-20b-multilingual\n\nFine tune the model\n\nTraining a model using InstructLab involves several customizable options depending on the system and resources available. The process begins by running the ilab model train command within a Python virtual environment. GPU acceleration, , significantly enhances training speed. For advanced workflows, multi-phase training can be used, where the model is trained sequentially on knowledge and skills datasets to optimize performance. Once training is complete, the model can be evaluated to select the best checkpoint and tested to compare performance before and after training.\n\nilab model train \\ --strategy lab-multiphase \\ --phased-phase1-data <knowledge train messages jsonl> \\ --phased-phase2-data <skills train messages jsonl> -y\n\nFor more information on InstructLab, visit this article.\n\nc. Application development\n\nAfter the model is trained and validated on watsonx, the model is published in Qualcomm AI Hub. The model becomes available for the OEM developers to build their custom applications. Qualcomm AI Hub enables you to do the following:\n\nCompile and optimize the pre-trained PyTorch model into a format that can be run on a device\n\nSubmit a profile job to run inference with the compiled model on a real physical device with a Snapdragon or Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 chipset\n\nMeasure on-device model performance Confirm latency and memory are below required targets Get insights on which compute units (NPU, GPU and CPU) the model layers are running on\n\nVerify numerical accuracy of the model with an inference job\n\n3. Lifecycle governance\n\nwatsonx.governance handles lifecycle governance by extending AI best practices from predictive machine learning to generative AI while mitigating risks across models, users, and datasets. It supports responsible AI through explainability, transparency, and compliance with internal and external regulations. Watsonx.governance enables real-time monitoring of model performance and fairness and management of lifecycle metadata for models and templates, ensuring compliance. Monitoring metrics including those for RAG, drift and model performance, while Guardrails restrict outputs of hate speech, aggression and profanity. The AI risk atlas provides educational guidance on potential risks, supporting organizations in creating robust governance frameworks. Governance workflows integrate roles from model development to deployment and monitoring, fostering a structured and responsible AI lifecycle.\n\na. Model evaluation\n\nModel evaluation involves running assessments on prompt templates to ensure performance and compliance. Evaluations can be configured using the wizard or via APIs, where you select dimensions and metrics, adjust settings like sample sizes and thresholds, and provide the test data to map input and expected outputs. Results are reviewed in the Evaluations tab, offering insights into metric scores, threshold violations, and visualizations over time to understand model performance and processing efficiency. This process helps ensure robust and effective model deployments.\n\nb. Continuous compliance\n\nThe Model Risk Governance (MRG) solution, facilitates comprehensive governance across all model types within an organization. It employs object types like Models, Model Groups, Use Cases, and Use Case Reviews to manage compliance, risk ratings, and stakeholder approvals. The dashboard provides a centralized view of compliance status, validation, and risk levels. Workflows automate key governance processes, such as use case approval and model lifecycle management, ensuring thorough oversight from development to deployment. This integrated approach enables continuous compliance and risk management for enterprise AI solutions.\n\nc. Runtime monitoring\n\nModels are monitored in real-time, enabling OEMs to track the performance of their Generative AI applications at the Edge. This monitoring encompasses metrics such as fairness, drift, and answer relevance.\n\nConclusion: a new era of Edge AI\n\nThe collaboration between IBM and Qualcomm Technologies marks a significant milestone in edge AI development.

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.12%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 1.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.46%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 4.25% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 7.5% and lagging the S&P 500's loss of 4.13% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of IBM in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.43, showcasing a 14.88% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.44 billion, down 0.18% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $10.78 per share and a revenue of $64.85 billion, indicating changes of +4.36% and +3.34%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for IBM. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.04% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, IBM possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nIn the context of valuation, IBM is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 23.48. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.77.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM's PEG ratio is currently 5.55. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory.

This was the first time, outside of a Hollywood sci-fi movie that the world saw AI in action, and it was very impressive. Over the next few years with their IBM World of Watson held in Las Vegas, they grew. They put on an impressive event. It looked like they were headed for the stars. Then reality set in.\n\nWatson was AI, even though IBM chose not to say so. I believe that was part of the mistake the first time around. The marketplace was simply not ready yet for AI or for Watson, yet.\n\nTo tell you the truth, the IBM World of Watson was one of the most impressive and exciting events I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few of them over 40 years. I was invited to be part of the spectacle and was frankly blown away.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened. Watson slipped through IBMs fingers. It faded away as quickly as it showed up on our collective doorstep. They ultimately sold off parts of this amazing and incredible display of technology to others around the world.\n\nIBM started to rebuild Watsonx, which is AI, and Quantum\n\nThen, IBM went quiet, strategized and started to rebuild. Now, they seem to be coming back, although things are different.\n\nA decade ago, IBM caught the attention of the world. That was when the marketplace was quieter.\n\nNow, it\u2019s a noisy and chaotic marketplace with countless different AI technologies and everyone is screaming for attention.\n\nIn this crazy marketplace, IBM is too quiet. Times have changed. Now is when IBM needs to realize this before it\u2019s too late and they let Watsonx and Quantum slip through their fingers once again.\n\nIBM needs to be seen and heard in noisy and distracting marketplace\n\nIf they are interested, I can tell them where they went wrong last decade. It was so obvious to me from the start. This time I want them to succeed. AI is in the very early stages, so know is when it is important to flex their muscles.\n\nIn the past couple years, AI has burst back onto the scene with countless corporate leaders like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook or Meta and countless others.\n\nToday, it seems like the world has finally caught onto AI. However, they still do not know what to expect, for better and for worse.\n\nThis is when the world needs a leader in artificial intelligence. A way for them to know what to expect and how their world will change.\n\nA few companies have the power to fill that void. Will IBM become one of those AI and Quantum leaders?\n\nAfter the IBM Watson mistake, they are now rebuilding with Watsonx and Quantum\n\nA funny thing seems to be happening, behind the scenes. IBM Watson was reborn as Watsonx. And IBM Quantum is also moving very quickly.\n\nThat being said, not enough people know about it.\n\nLast time around, IBM used PR and Twitter (x) to pump the hell out of Watson during the last decade.\n\nThat worked for a while, but \u201cX\u201d was new, and no one really knows how to make the magic happen.\n\nAI and Quantum are two, big, new growth sectors\n\nThis time, while everyone else is screaming to the rooftops, IBM seems gun shy. This is the time they need PR and Twitter (X) and LinkedIn and Google search more than ever before.\n\nLast decade, IBM was on the right track, but it didn\u2019t work. Now, they started to refocus on the new Watsonx and Quantum.\n\nBottom line is, these are perhaps the two biggest technology advancements we have seen in our lifetimes.\n\nEven bigger than the iPhone and Android smartphone revolution starting roughly 18 years ago.\n\nIn fact, AI and Quantum will be many times larger and more impactful compared to the wireless world and smartphones.\n\nNew CEO Arvind Krishna reviving IBM with Watsonx and Quantum\n\nOur world is on the brink of a major rewrite. This U-turn happened under the leadership of new CEO Arvind Krishna.\n\nKrishna says Quantum will indeed be not only a new technology but will develop into a foundational technology. He also says by the end of the decade, advances in both coherence times and error-correction will accelerate growth these two sectors.\n\nAnd that is exactly where he is positioning IBM to lead. They are focusing on improvements in Quantum hardware. They are also focused on extending qubit coherence times dramatically.\n\nToday, their focus seems both on AI and Quantum, which are not directly related, but potentially connected technologies. Just think of what Google is doing with DeepMind and OpenAI with ChatGPT technology and a growing number of others.\n\nElon Musk says we have entered Event Horizon and Singularity is next\n\nElon Musk says we have already entered the \u201cevent horizon\u201d for AI. This is a measurement of how close to the \u201csingularity\u201d we can safely get. Once we pass the event horizon, we can no longer escape.\n\n\u201cEvent Horizon\u201d was a term coined in the 1950s with regard to Black Holes. It is the doorway of sorts. In theory, once we cross over into the event horizon, we are trapped and cannot break free.\n\nWith regard to AI, singularity is when we cross over that line in the sand and the technology writes its own software. We begin to lose control over its advancement.\n\nThis has never happened before, so we are really only guessing what will happen at that point.\n\nWhy is IBM not using PR and X the same as last time?\n\nIBM CEO Krishna is taking the company in bold, new directions. The timing seems right.\n\nAt some point, in the near future I believe, IBM will start to fuel the fire and start acting like a leader in both AI and Quantum computing.\n\nThese are two of what may indeed become the fastest growing and most consequential new technologies we have ever seen in our lifetimes.\n\nThat being said, the marketplace is very loud and chaotic today. That means players need to punch their way through the noise and chaos to be seen and heard.\n\nIBM needs to shout about their technology in a loud and distracting marketplace\n\nOver time, IBM has gone through many ups and downs over their history.\n\nHowever, today the marketplace is louder and noisier than ever before. Companies need to punch their way through the noise just to be noticed.\n\nJust having a strong brand name is not enough. Every company must punch their way onto the map.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know what the future holds, but IBM is one of the companies who in my opinion may be too big, too important, to fail.\n\nIBM could become a leader in AI and Quantum. If they do the right things starting now. There will be many. I would hate to see IBM let this growth opportunity slip through their fingers.\n\nThat being said, IBM needs to punch their way through the noise and be noticed. They are not doing so today. Not yet anyway. Can they? Will they? We will see.\n\nMore from Jeff Kagan: Why Nvidia has Wall Street scratching its head over AI investing",

            "content": "Now that IBM has completed the acquisition of HashiCorp the focus will now shift toward integrating the various DevOps tools, frameworks and platforms the combined companies provide to securely automate the development and deployment of software.\n\nMeghan Liese, vice president of product marketing for HashiCorp, said the goal now is to make it simpler for DevOps teams to use tools such as Terraform to provision IT infrastructure alongside frameworks such as Ansible for Red Hat and FinOps tools from Apptio to manage IT operations. IBM acquired Apptio in 2023.\n\nCollectively, that foundation will make it simpler for DevOps and platform engineering teams to keep a system-of-record as changes are dynamically made to IT environments that are being managed as code, she noted.\n\nAs part of that effort, the managed cloud services provided by HashiCorp will reduce the overall number of misconfigurations that have historically occurred when application developers programmatically provision IT infrastructure, Liese added.\n\nHashiCorp, of course, as a unit of IBM will also be able to take greater advantage of investments in artificial intelligence (AI) that have been previously made. It\u2019s not clear to what degree AI will automate the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure, but it\u2019s already apparent that many workflows will soon be re-engineered using, for example, AI agents to more reliably provision IT infrastructure and optimize consumption of resources.\n\nLess clear is to what degree DevOps teams might soon rationalize the number of tools and platforms currently used to build and deploy software as more DevOps workflows become automated.\n\nRegardless of approach, DevOps teams would be well-advised to identify now which tasks are likely to become more automated as AI technologies become more pervasively employed. Undoubtedly, some organizations will use those capabilities to reduce the overall size of their IT teams, while others will seize an opportunity to build and deploy more applications at higher levels of scale. One way or the other, higher levels of automation should substantially reduce the amount of toil currently experienced by most DevOps teams. Despite a deep commitment among DevOps practitioners to ruthlessly automating as many processes as possible, there are still plenty of manual bottlenecks in workflows that truth be told many of the engineers performing would rather see eliminated so long as their overall role continues to evolve.\n\nOf course, it remains to be seen in the age of AI just how much software can be built, deployed, secured and maintained by any one organization but the one thing that is likely to increase is complexity. The more applications deployed, the greater the number of dependencies between software components there will be. In larger organizations, the amount of software deployed is already well beyond the ability of IT teams to manually track and manage.\n\nThe challenge and the opportunity now is to leverage advances being made in automation to make it simpler for organizations of any size to build, deploy and consume as much software as they could possibly need without necessarily always needing to hire a small army of software engineers to support it.",

(CEO Young-ho Yun, KOSDAQ: 419120) recently completed the development of IBM Plex Sans Traditional Chinese (TC) and Simplified Chinese (SC).\n\nThis achievement has further solidified Sandoll\u2019s reputation as a trusted partner for global corporations, driving continued growth. It is also in response to the latest trend where the need for multilingual fonts in international markets is growing, and CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) font development capabilities are becoming important accordingly.\n\nThe IBM Plex Sans font series is a multilingual typography project launched by IBM in 2017 to provide a consistent typographic experience across different languages. Covering Latin, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and more, the project\u2019s CJK font development was led by Sandoll.\n\nThe development of IBM Plex Sans CJK began in 2018 and took approximately seven years. The primary challenge was ensuring that Latin typographic characteristics were harmoniously integrated into CJK fonts, requiring significant effort and refinement.\n\nThe newly-released IBM Plex Sans TC and SC maintain IBM\u2019s design philosophy while optimizing Chinese character structure and readability.\n\nA key focus was to maximize legibility in digital environments while preserving the unique features of each script. The Chinese fonts were carefully adjusted to maintain visual balance with Latin, Korean, and Japanese fonts, reinforcing IBM\u2019s brand identity.\n\nThanks to this high level of precision, IBM Plex Sans is now widely used across IBM\u2019s entire product ecosystem. The font has received positive reviews for its readability and design consistency, further strengthening IBM\u2019s collaboration with Sandoll and attracting new global projects.\n\nSandoll\u2019s expertise in CJK font development, combined with its industry-leading hinting technology, enables companies to create CJK fonts simultaneously while ensuring optimal readability and consistent typography. This streamlined approach also simplifies future language expansion and technical support, while increasing demand from global clients.\n\nBy developing CJK fonts as a unified set, companies can enhance brand consistency, improve efficiency, and reduce development costs and time. Additionally, the need for complex communication is eliminated, ensuring seamless project execution.\n\nA Sandoll representative stated, \u201cSandoll has the capability to develop not only CJK fonts but also Latin, Cyrillic, and other global scripts. We will continue to invest in research and development, strengthen partnerships with global corporations, and expand our global presence.\u201d\n\nSandoll, founded in 1984, is South Korea\u2019s leading type foundry. The company developed Malgun Gothic, the default Korean font for Microsoft Office, and was responsible for the Noto Sans & Serif KR, created in collaboration with Google and Adobe. Sandoll also designed Apple SD Sandoll Gothic Neo, a system font for Apple, and has been recognized for its top-tier font technology through the creation of custom corporate fonts for global brands such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sided with Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys and denied tech giant IBM\u2019s request to withhold a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion shareholder resolution from the proxy ballot at its upcoming annual meeting. The latest victory makes ADF 9-for-9 at the SEC over the past three years.\n\nThe denial means that IBM shareholders can vote on a resolution filed by The Heritage Foundation calling on IBM\u2019s board of directors to issue a report about the effects of the company\u2019s DEI policies at IBM\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, which will likely be held in late April. IBM had requested permission to keep shareholders from weighing in on the proposal, but the SEC denied the request after ADF attorneys called particular attention to the company\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d claim that it was unable to properly understand or define DEI.\n\n\u201cPublicly traded corporations like IBM should not hide the truth from their shareholders,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel and Senior Vice President for Corporate Engagement Jeremy Tedesco. \u201cDecisions about hotly contested topics like DEI affect every shareholder, customer, and employee. And President Trump\u2019s recent executive orders on DEI in federal contracting take direct aim at policies like IBM\u2019s. It is clearer now more than ever that DEI policies introduce steep legal, operational, and reputational risks that far outweigh any perceived benefit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that IBM comes clean and provides its shareholders the transparency they need to make their own decisions about how to exercise their rights as owners in the company.\u201d\n\nDiscriminatory DEI policies have been a primary point of discussion in business, politics, and culture over the past year or more\u2014reaching a fever pitch with President Trump\u2019s executive actions meant to root out DEI at government entities, government contractors like IBM (whose federal contracts are worth over a billion dollars per year), and throughout the private sector. Portions of the order, including those applying to federal contracts, are currently enjoined while litigation challenging the orders proceeds.\n\nMajor companies ranging from Amazon and Meta to Target and Walmart have all scrapped DEI policies over the past several months. Most recently, financial titan Blackrock announced it is also cutting ties with DEI, while Apple CEO Tim Cook indicated during his company\u2019s annual meeting that Apple is also distancing itself from discriminatory DEI goals\u2014a statement immediately amplified online by Trump.\n\nHeritage\u2019s resolution highlights leaked remarks of IBM\u2019s CEO that have led to a high-profile lawsuit initiated by the state of Missouri. Released by undercover journalist James O\u2019Keefe, the footage shows CEO Arvind Krishna and Paul Cormier, chairman of IBM\u2019s subsidiary Red Hat, responding to an employee\u2019s question about IBM\u2019s DEI commitments. In the video, Krishna states that hiring managers\u2019 bonuses hinge on their meeting internal DEI hiring requirements. Cormier even boasted about \u201cmultiple leaders over the last year plus that were held accountable to the point that they\u2019re no longer here at Red Hat.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, ADF has gone 4-for-4 at the SEC, successfully backing resolutions at John Deere, Starbucks, and Apple, where all four proposals on the ballot originated from ADF\u2019s shareholder coalition and allies.\n\n\u201cDiscriminatory DEI policies have no place in our country,\u201d said Heritage Foundation Vice President of Finance and Accounting, and Treasurer John Backiel. \u201cHeritage has a vested interest in the long-term fiduciary health of IBM. Publicly traded companies like IBM belong to us, their shareholders. That\u2019s why the SEC was right to deny IBM\u2019s request and ensure that we can join this crucial conversation. IBM leaders owe us insight into the business decisions that not only jeopardize our investment but fly in the face of our organization\u2019s stance on issues of human dignity that affect every American.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n\n# # #",

But on the other hand, it could be used to undermine the cryptographic principles that the Internet relies on today. That is why Vodafone and IBM are working together with other partners to get ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\nLory Thorpe, Quantum Safe Industry Lead, IBM, added: \u201cAs a pioneer in quantum-safe cryptography and solutions, IBM is proud to expand our collaboration with Vodafone to help protect its customers from anticipated quantum risks. It\u2019s crucial for organizations to implement post-quantum cryptography, and Vodafone has led by example as an early adopter of post-quantum security solutions.\u201d\n\nSomeday, future cryptographically relevant quantum computers could be used to break today\u2019s Internet encryption techniques. While this risk may still be years away, cybercriminals are using \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks to harvest and store data for later decryption. Recognizing this risk, in 2024, IBM\u2019s cryptography researchers co-developed two algorithms which were published as part of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s (NIST) first three post-quantum cryptography standards.\n\nIn addition, Vodafone became one of the first companies to successfully test IBM Quantum Safe technology to identify and inventory cryptography in its network infrastructure and systems. Through the new proof of concept based on the IBM Quantum Safe technology, the company is leading the charge in implementing current post-quantum cryptography standards from NIST.\n\nVodafone and IBM are also founding members of the GSMA\u2019s Post-Quantum Telco Network Task Force, an industry working group founded in 2022 that has grown to include more than 50 telecommunications companies and 20 major operators across the telecommunications industry.\n\nVodafone and IBM will be available at MWC25 to discuss this latest quantum-safe collaboration.

            "content": "Researchers and engineers at IBM are hustling to build out a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer by 2029, according to a senior executive steering that work.\n\nIn the process, the team is generating cutting-edge devices that can no longer be modeled with classical computing architectures. And the company recognizes the U.S. government\u2019s need for quantum-safe security measures.\n\n\u201cThe next [four to five years are] probably going to be the most exciting time in quantum computing. You\u2019ve gone from it being a scientific exploration into the hardware, to how do we actually start using these quantum computers to do real things and scale them up,\u201d said Jay Gambetta, IBM\u2019s vice president for quantum.\n\nA leading quantum computing expert with more than two decades of professional experience, Gambetta joined IBM in 2011 \u2014 about seven years after he moved to the U.S. from Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was the first to pull [an IBM-built] quantum computer onto the cloud\u201d back in 2016, he said.\n\nGambetta recently hosted a small group of journalists at the company\u2019s Washington, D.C., office for a roundtable to discuss some of IBM\u2019s recent quantum computing advancements, and his team\u2019s roadmap and vision for what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cAt a high level, the U.S. has as always been a leader in quantum computing, and as we go into this new, next phase, we have to remain a leader in both continuing to build the best quantum computers and also being the first to use them for useful applications,\u201d he said.\n\nQuantum computing is considered an alternative computational paradigm and, broadly, applies certain laws of physics to digital information processing. It\u2019s part of the emerging and disruptive technology field of quantum information science (QIS) that uses complex phenomena happening at atomic and subatomic levels to store, transmit, manipulate, process and measure information.\n\nThe Defense Department and other federal agencies have been increasingly prioritizing quantum-enabling activities and investments as proponents largely predict it will lead to revolutionary breakthroughs \u2014 like an unhackable internet \u2014 in the not-so-distant future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM is in a small cadre of major U.S. businesses, including Google and Microsoft, vying to be the first to generate a quantum system that can outperform all the classical computers that came before.\n\n\u201cThe whole purpose of quantum computing, and the whole thesis of it, is that there are algorithms that exist that no classical computer can ever simulate. Most famous of it is Shor\u2019s algorithm, but more practical in terms of commercial applications is simulating chemistry, simulating materials, simulating biology, simulating finance, doing some risk calculation, some optimization. They are the reason we\u2019re all doing it,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the heels of recent innovations, IBM aims to start experimenting with using a quantum computer as a scientific tool to discover new algorithms.\n\nGambetta noted that the field of AI optimization is based on heuristic algorithms, or those that use approximate solutions to puzzle out answers to complex problems.\n\n\u201cWe, as a society, have benefited from algorithm discovery, and we continue to benefit from it. Now we have something that we\u2019ve got to add to it. And I expect that in the next year or two, we will see legitimate demonstrations of quantum advantage or supremacy. I prefer the word \u2018advantage,\u2019 but you call it whatever you want. [But it means] where we\u2019ll actually see a quantum computer do something cheaper, faster, or more cost-effective than the classical computer alignment,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s been rising hype over the last decade around possibilities for the future of quantum. Gambetta acknowledged that, as well as critics\u2019 responses, but said he\u2019s confident IBM is on the cusp of some next-level breakthroughs.\n\n\u201cIn some sense, to me, we\u2019re in this most exciting time. We\u2019re now getting devices that you can no longer simulate with classical computing,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly government focus and investments from defense and intelligence research labs zoned in on proving the existence of quantum bits, or qubits, the basic unit of information used to encode data in quantum computing.\n\nThe congressionally mandated National Quantum Initiative (NQI) enacted in 2018 accelerated U.S. progress when momentum was already swiftly building, Gambetta noted. And alongside new innovations in cloud access, it meant the government\u2019s focus shifted from fundamental research science to puzzling out and pursuing more practical applications.\n\n\u201cNow we have 100-qubit machines that are beyond what we can simulate. So, you can build whatever classical computer you want but you can\u2019t simulate it to do the pen-and-paper algorithms that we all want to do for quantum computing,\u201d he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeading experts are also now more serious than ever about ensuring the in-the-works advanced quantum systems are being built in a way that they can be quickly and safely linked up and scaled as soon as they\u2019re fully realized.\n\n\u201cQuantum communication, quantum computing, quantum sensing \u2014 they were all kind of almost distinctly different [in the past]. But the future is going to actually be quantum computers connected to quantum sensors connected with quantum communication,\u201d Gambetta said.\n\nResponding to DefenseScoop\u2019s questions at the roundtable, the quantum chief discussed some of the high-priority challenges that anticipated quantum innovations pose for the DOD and U.S. military.\n\n\u201cOne of the algorithms that quantum computers will break is RSA, which [underpins] a lot of our security,\u201d Gambetta explained, referring to the widely used Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman public-key cryptosystem for securing data transmissions.\n\n\u201cThe quantum computers we\u2019ve built today don\u2019t break [it] because they\u2019ve got to be bigger to do that. But we know, given our commercial roadmap, that will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why quantum computers obviously drive a lot of national security concerns.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, government agencies are working to transition to more protected security architectures and uncover new quantum-safe algorithms that won\u2019t be broken by the future supercomputers.\n\nQuantum computing further holds promise to expand DOD\u2019s ability to solve complex logistics problems.\n\nGambetta noted the technology also \u201cchanges the equation for simulating materials,\u201d which the Pentagon spends heaps of high-performance computing resources on.\n\n\u201cWe know this future [of IBM-run fault-tolerant quantum computers] is coming. I think how the commercialization of this gets done is a complicated question, and it\u2019s why we\u2019re talking so much with the people in the government,\u201d he said.",

The challenge, he explains, comes down to two key issues: high error rates and coherence loss. While all computers experience errors, classical computing systems have built-in mechanisms that make them nearly invisible to users. Quantum computers, by contrast, are far more sensitive to disruptions, as tiny amounts of energy can interfere with their calculations.\n\nKrishna said IBM has made steady progress in managing these challenges, improving coherence times\u2014how long a quantum bit, or qubit, maintains its quantum state\u2014to about a tenth of a millisecond. The goal is to extend this to a full millisecond, which he believes will enable quantum computers to perform calculations impossible for today\u2019s classical machines.\n\n\u201cWe feel over the next three, four, five years \u2014 I give myself till the end of the decade \u2014 we will see something remarkable happen on that front and I\u2019m really happy where our team is,\u201d Krishna told Time.\n\nTranslating Hardware Advances to Practical Benefits\n\nIBM\u2019s long-term strategy hinges on translating these hardware advances into practical applications for clients. Krishna envisions industries such as materials science, pharmaceuticals, and energy benefiting from quantum-powered discoveries.\n\n\u201cThey will get the value, whether it\u2019s material discovery or better batteries or better fertilizers or better drugs, that value will be accrued by our clients,\u201d Krishna told the magazing.\n\nIBM\u2019s role, he argues, is to be the dominant provider of working quantum systems. Krisha added that this would gives IBM a tremendous position and the first-mover advantage.\n\nIBM\u2019s commitment to quantum comes as other major players, including Google and startups such as IonQ and Rigetti, push forward with their own efforts. While Google\u2019s approach focuses on demonstrating \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2014 a point where quantum computers surpass classical computers in a specific task\u2014IBM has taken a more incremental approach, focusing on improving hardware performance and reducing error rates before scaling up.\n\nQuantum computing is still in its early stages, but Krishna believes it will eventually be as integral to computing as the smartphone was to personal technology.\n\nKrishna said: \u201cTechnology has always been additive. The smartphone didn\u2019t remove the laptop. I think quantum will be additive. But much like we helped invent mainframes in the PC, maybe on quantum we\u2019ll occupy that same position for quite a while.\u201d\n\nIBM\u2019s AI Strategy\n\nIBM\u2019s strategy for artificial intelligence diverges sharply from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind, which have focused on scaling up large general-purpose AI models. Krishna argues that bigger isn\u2019t always better. Instead of developing massive AI models that require billions of dollars in compute resources, IBM is betting on smaller, specialized models tailored for specific business applications.\n\n\u201cSo if I have a 10 billion parameter model and I have a 1 trillion parameter model, it\u2019s going to be 10,000 times more expensive to run the very big model,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cThen you turn around and ask the question, if it\u2019s only 1% better, do I really want to pay 10,000 times more? And that answer in the business world is almost always no. But if it can be 10 times smaller, hey, that\u2019s well worth it, because that drops more than 90% of the cost of running it. That is what drove our decision.\u201d\n\nIBM\u2019s AI approach stems from lessons learned from its early AI ventures. In the 1990s, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue became the first chess computer to defeat a human world champion, and in 2011, Watson won the game show Jeopardy! But subsequent efforts to apply AI broadly, such as in medical diagnostics, ran into challenges. Krishna said IBM underestimated the complexities of industries like healthcare, including regulatory requirements and operational workflows.\n\nThat experience led IBM to rethink its AI strategy. Rather than trying to create monolithic models that attempt to solve broad problems, the company has focused on developing fit-for-purpose models that optimize for specific tasks. Krishna disagrees with the idea that AI\u2019s greatest potential lies in generalist systems.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to have an answer that\u2019s only 90% accurate, maybe,\u201d Krishna told Time. \u201cBut if I\u2019d like to control a blast furnace, it needs to be correct 100% of the time. That model better have some idea of time-series analysis baked into it. \u201c\n\nKrishna sees AI\u2019s economic benefits being distributed between large companies that train foundational models and smaller businesses that apply them to specific use cases. He compares AI\u2019s development to the early days of the internet, where both large platforms and small businesses thrived.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to build a video streaming business, the more content you have, the more people you can serve,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a network effect, you get an economy of scale. On the other hand, you have a shopfront like Etsy. Suddenly the person who\u2019s an artisan who makes two items a year can still have a presence because the cost of distribution is extremely low.\u201d\n\nTIME spoke with Krishna ahead of a ceremony in early February when he was awarded a TIME100 AI Impact Award.",

As strategic investors, we commit to sharing expertise, opening doors globally to customers and partners, and co-branding, providing credibility with IBM Ventures as an investor.\n\nWhat types of Israeli startups/entrepreneurs are you interested in?\n\nWe are interested in companies innovating at the intersection of AI and the enterprise - AI applications, infrastructure, tooling to build and secure applications, or new compute paradigms like quantum computing. We invest in our areas of expertise and look for a strategic element to fill a gap and enhance our offerings. We look for founders with deep technical backgrounds and networks ready to engage with the IBM ecosystem. We work closely with IBM\u2019s overall strategy and focus on companies that can credibly advance its core strategic priorities: AI, hybrid cloud today, and quantum computing in the future.\n\nWhy invest in an Israeli company in New York? What advantages do such companies have? How is the New York market different from the Israeli market?\n\nWhen we\u2019re looking at any investment, there are a couple of critical pieces that differentiate successful teams:\n\n1) deep technical talent for today, and to fuel R&D for the future, and\n\n2) access to large tech buyers locally and abroad.\n\nIsraeli entrepreneurs often check these boxes, making them great partners. Once a portfolio company, there\u2019s the added advantage of IBM Ventures NYC connections to help navigate the large enterprise ecosystem in NYC.\n\nHow do Israeli entrepreneurs/startups differ from their local counterparts?\n\nWe find NYC-based startups and Israeli counterparts quite similar; both tend to have hustle and a no-nonsense attitude. Typically, local companies tend to be more plugged into the local tech and enterprise ecosystem as their backgrounds are often at large enterprises before starting their company. In contrast, Israeli founders usually must do more work to break into this ecosystem but have the advantage of a talent network in Tel Aviv that most local companies cannot access.\n\nAre there any legal or regulatory considerations that you take into account when investing in Israel?\n\nIBM Ventures evaluates companies on innovation, financial viability, their ability to complement IBM\u2019s capabilities and systems, and potential synergies with IBM's focused business strategy. We do deep regulatory, legal, financial, strategic, and compliance diligence for every investment we make regardless of location.\n\nHow do you deal with possible law/regulation changes in Israel?\n\nAs part of regulatory, legal, and compliance diligence, we leverage internal experts to ensure we are aware of any risks related to possible law/regulation changes.\n\nAre there global trends that influence your decisions to invest in Israeli high-tech?\n\nAs we look to invest at the intersection of AI and the enterprise, we are keenly aware of AI's potential to disrupt and change entire industries. Historically, Israeli entrepreneurs have been at the center of building the infrastructure and security tools for each new technology trend.\n\nTwo suggestions for Israeli entrepreneurs on what to do in New York:\n\nLeverage the local Israeli organizations already engaged in the NYC tech ecosystem. Attend events hosted by Israeli investors with a strong NYC presence, engage with US-based investors who have invested in Israeli companies and network with other founders who have been successful in NYC before.\n\nExpand your network and engage with the NYC tech community. Attend events (IBM often hosts local tech events), grow your buyer network, and try to create new relationships with founders and investors.\n\nTwo suggestions for Israeli entrepreneurs on what not to do in New York:\n\nTake time to study the local competitors, refine your messaging, and clearly articulate your unique value proposition in a way that resonates with the enterprise buyer ecosystem in New York. Don\u2019t underestimate local competition for customers and talent.\n\nInvest in networking and creating relationships outside of the Israeli community. Aim to expand your reach to investors and customers who might not be familiar with the Israeli ecosystem. Don\u2019t just live within just the Israeli community bubble.\n\nExamples of 2-3 of your most successful investments:\n\nGem Security: We partnered with Gem at their Series A, alongside Notable Capital and Team8. Gem expanded its market presence significantly and securing major enterprise clients, including joint go-to-market efforts with IBM, proving the power of our capital-plus model. In 2024, they were acquired by Wiz, an excellent outcome for the founders, employees, and investors.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Large-Cap Stocks with Insider Buying in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other large-cap stocks.\n\nInsider buying is one of the strongest indirect signals that analysts and successful investors often use to assess whether a stock is undervalued or not. The intuition behind this stems from the fact that high-ranked insiders such as named executive officers and directors possess confidential information that may give greater visibility into the company\u2019s future and growth trajectory. Insiders leverage such information as real-time data on sales and orders, and discussions with key clients, suppliers and other stakeholders, to form a better understanding of the company\u2019s valuation. For instance, insiders often show net selling of their own company stock at peak valuations, just days or weeks before a major market correction happens; and vice versa, insiders often show net buying at or near market bottoms, days or weeks before the stock price starts to increase. This is clearly not a coincidence most of the time. Also, many successful investors emphasized the idea that insider buying is often a stronger signal than selling. Here is what Peter Lynch, one of the greatest ever, said on this topic:\n\n\u201cInsiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.\u201d\n\nWith the US stock market having experienced a very strong bull market for the last 2 years, insider buying has become increasingly muted, with insider selling starting to prevail, especially in apparently overbought sectors like technology. This trend suggests that executives and institutional investors may see limited upside in certain high-flying stocks, prompting them to lock in gains. However, a significant portion of those strong returns have been driven only by a handful of companies, often called the \u201cMagnificent 8\u201d, which experienced an uplift from AI and other megatrends. At the same time, on an equal-weight basis, the US stock market has had a more modest performance. Some sectors like healthcare are at or near multi-year lows on a relative basis, driven by a combination of headwinds as well as a lack of tailwinds to the same extent as the technology leaders. The key takeaway for investors is that regardless of what point in the cycle we are, or how long into a bull market we are, both buying and selling opportunities will exist.\n\nALSO READ: 10 Technology Stocks with Insider Buying in 2024\n\nThe US stock market is still near its early 2025 all-time high and exhibits peak concentration and net insider selling. We believe that at such extreme points, when high valuation concerns are widely spread in the news, the signals provided by insiders buying their own company stocks are more valuable than ever. Their actions can indicate where genuine value exists beneath the broader market\u2019s surface, highlighting sectors or individual companies that may be overlooked or undervalued. Insider buying in such an environment suggests confidence in a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, despite broader market uncertainties or short-term volatility. Investors who pay close attention to these signals may uncover opportunities in sectors that have lagged behind, offering potential for strong future returns as market conditions evolve. Last but not least, large-cap companies are usually widely followed and exhibit more price efficiency; consequently, insider buying signals in these stocks are even more relevant in our opinion.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener to find large-cap stocks with at least two insiders buying shares worth at least $100,000 in the last six months. We believe that multiple insiders buying significant amounts of stock represents a higher chance that insiders have high confidence in the company. For all the companies, we also include the number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, as of Q4 2024, that own the stock. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company offering a wide range of products and services, including hardware, software, cloud computing, and consulting.

            "content": "(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and decisionmakers, click here.) IBM was one of the giants of 20th-century computing. It helped design the modern PC, and created the first AI to defeat a human champion in the game of chess. But when you think of AI, IBM might not be the first, or even the tenth, company to spring to mind. It doesn\u2019t train big models, and doesn\u2019t make consumer-facing products any more, focusing instead on selling to other businesses. \u201cWe are a B2B company, and explaining what we do to the average reader\u2014we'll take all the help we can get,\u201d IBM CEO Arvind Krishna joked ahead of a recent interview with TIME.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStill, there\u2019s an interesting AI story lurking inside this storied institution. IBM does indeed build AI models\u2014not massive ones like OpenAI\u2019s GPT4-o or Google\u2019s Gemini, but smaller ones designed for use in high-stakes settings, where accuracy comes at a premium. As the AI business matures, this gets at a critical unanswered question on the minds of Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors: will the economic gains from AI mostly accrue to the companies that train massive \u201cfoundation models\u201d like OpenAI? Or will they flow instead to the companies\u2014like IBM\u2014that can build the leanest, cheapest, most accurate models that are tailored for specific use-cases? The future of the industry could depend on it. TIME spoke with Krishna in early February, ahead of a ceremony during which he was awarded a TIME100 AI Impact Award. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. IBM built Deep Blue, the first chess AI to beat a human champion, in the 1990s. Then, in 2011, IBM\u2019s Watson was the first to win the game show Jeopardy. But today, IBM isn\u2019t training large AI systems in the same way as OpenAI or Google. Can you explain why the decision was made to take a backseat from the AI race?\n\nWhen you look at chess and Jeopardy, the reason for taking on those challenges was the right one. You pick a thing that people believe computers cannot do, and then if you can do it, you're conveying the power of the technology. Here was the place where we went off: We started building systems that I'll call monolithic. We started saying, let's go attack a problem like cancer. That turned out to be the wrong approach. Absolutely it is worth solving, so I don't fault what our teams did at that point. However, are we known for being medical practitioners? No. Do we understand how hospitals and protocols work? No. Do we understand how the regulator works in that area? No. With hindsight, I wish we had thought about that just for a couple of minutes at the beginning. So then we said, OK, you can produce larger and larger models, and they'll take more and more compute. So option one, take a billion dollars of compute and you produce a model. Now to get a return on it, you\u2019ve got to charge people a certain amount. But can we distill it down to a much smaller model that may not take as much compute, and is much, much cheaper to run, but is a fit-for-purpose model for a task in a business context? That is what led to the business lens.\n\nBut one of the central takeaways of the last 10 years in deep learning seems to be that you can get more out of AI systems by just trying to make them generalist than you can by trying to make them specialized in a single area. Right? That's what's referred to as \u201cthe bitter lesson.\u201d I might politely disagree with that. If you're willing to have an answer that's only 90% accurate, maybe. But if I'd like to control a blast furnace, it needs to be correct 100% of the time. That model better have some idea of time-series analysis baked into it. It's not a generalist machine that decided to somehow intuit Moby Dick to come up with its answer. So with respect, no. If you are actually trying to get to places where you need much higher accuracy, you actually may do much better with a smaller model. I actually believe there will be a few very large models. They\u2019ll cost a couple of billion dollars to train, or maybe even more. And there's going to be thousands of smaller models that are fit-for-purpose. They\u2019ll leverage the big ones for teaching, but not really for their inherent knowledge.\n\nAre the major economic benefits from AI going to accrue to the biggest companies that train the foundation models? Or to the smaller companies who apply those models to specific use cases? I think it's an exact \"and.\" I think the analogy of AI is probably closest to the early days of the internet. So on the internet, ask yourself the question, is it useful only for very large companies or for very small companies? Take two opposite examples. If I'm going to build a video streaming business, the more content you have, the more people you can serve. You get a network effect, you get an economy of scale. On the other hand, you have a shopfront like Etsy. Suddenly the person who's an artisan who makes two items a year can still have a presence because the cost of distribution is extremely low. How has your answer to that question influenced the direction of your business? We thought deeply about it. Back in 2020, we said: should we put all our investments into trying to build one very large model? If it's a very large model, the cost of running these models is, let's call it, the square of the size of the model.\n\nSo if I have a 10 billion parameter model and I have a 1 trillion parameter model, it's going to be 10,000 times more expensive to run the very big model. Then you turn around and ask the question, if it's only 1% better, do I really want to pay 10,000 times more? And that answer in the business world is almost always no. But if it can be 10 times smaller, hey, that's well worth it, because that drops more than 90% of the cost of running it. That is what drove our decision. Let\u2019s talk about quantum computing. IBM is a big investor in quantum. What\u2019s your bigger picture strategy there? So we picked quantum as an area for investment more than 10 years ago. We came to the conclusion that it's an engineering problem more than it's a science problem. The moment it's an engineering problem, now you have to ask yourself the question, can you solve the two fundamental issues that are there? One, the error rates are really high, but so are normal computers\u2019. What people don't recognize is: there are techniques that make it appear error free. There are errors deep down at the very fundamental level even on the machines we are on, but they correct themselves, and so we don't see them.\n\nTwo, because quantum by its nature is operating at a quantum level, very tiny amounts of energy can cause what\u2019s called coherence loss. So they don't work for very long. We believed if we could get close to a millisecond, you can do some really, really careful computations. And so we went down a path and we think we have made a lot of progress on the error correction. We're probably at a tenth of a millisecond, not quite at a millisecond yet, on the coherence times. We feel over the next three, four, five years\u2014I give myself till the end of the decade\u2014we will see something remarkable happen on that front and I'm really happy where our team is. If you can make the huge breakthrough that you say you hope to make by the end of the decade, where does that put IBM as a business? Does that leave you in a dominant position over the next wave of technology? There is hardware, and then there is all the people who will exploit it. So let me first begin with this: The people who will exploit it will be all our clients. They will get the value, whether it's material discovery or better batteries or better fertilizers or better drugs, that value will be accrued by our clients.\n\nBut who can give them a working quantum computer? I think that assuming the timeline and the breakthroughs I'm talking about happen, I think that gives us a tremendous position and the first-mover advantage in that market, to a point where I think that we would become the de-facto answer for those technologies.\n\nTechnology has always been additive. The smartphone didn't remove the laptop. I think quantum will be additive. But much like we helped invent mainframes in the PC, maybe on quantum we'll occupy that same position for quite a while.",

            "content": "Unlike traditional methods of computation that rely on a Binary language, Quantum computers look to leverage quantum bits or \u2018qubits' instead. Unlike Binary, which is built atop 0 and 1, qubits can be superimposed \u2013 meaning they can exist simultaneously as 0 and 1, or anywhere in between. The result is a system that is able to perform certain types of computation at speeds magnitudes quicker than more traditional approaches. The ability to process vast amounts of data and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers is a key reason why Quantum computing is so important. Their unmatched performance means that such systems boast massive potential for advancements in fields like medicine, environmental science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Before its potential can be realized, there are a few significant hurdles that must first be cleared; namely, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental changes (making them error-prone) in addition to only being effective for specific algorithms. With that in mind, the following are a few publicly traded companies leading the way in the research and development of this game-changing approach to computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a notable name that has made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. For example, by using its \u2018127-qubit Eagle quantum computer', IBM has been able to solve complex problems that long stumped the leading classical methods. Despite the challenges of noise and errors in quantum systems, IBM was able to generate accurate results by using an \u2018advanced error mitigation' technique that were verified by running the problem on a traditional supercomputer for lower levels of complexity.\n\nIn the time since its Eagle quantum computer was released, IBM has already developed a 433 qubit system known as \u2018Osprey' and is expected to soon launch a 1,121 qubit system known as Condor. Each of these successive generations greatly improves upon its predecessor while widening the gap between what is possible with a traditional supercomputer. IBM states that,\n\n\u201cAs quantum processors scale up, each additional qubit doubles the amount of space complexity \u2014 the amount of memory space required to execute algorithms \u2014 for a classical computer to reliably simulate quantum circuits.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential abilities of a quantum computer cannot be replicated by more traditional approaches, IBM notes that it does not envision a future where only one exists. Rather, the company anticipates that both quantum and binary variants will continue to thrive in use cases geared specifically toward the strengths of each.\n\nLooking forward, IBM has already announced its next major goal in anticipation of its current quantum chips \u2018outgrowing' the currently used infrastructure. This goal is known as \u2018IBM Quantum System Two'; a modular system that has the potential to support up to 16,632 qubits.\n\nIBM Quantum System Two: Design Sneak Preview\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nIntel is a pioneer in silicon transistors for traditional computing. Whether a desktop or laptop, the chances are good that, regardless of PC form factor, you have utilized a computer powered by an Intel chip.\n\nAs we make our way through 2023, Intel has forged a clear, yet divergent, strategy for the future that involves quantum computing. Drawing upon its existing expertise, Intel is leveraging its expertise in high-volume transistor manufacturing to develop silicon spin qubits.

            "content": "In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, organisations are exploring the next frontier\u2014Agentic AI. Ritika Gunnar, General Manager of Data & AI at IBM, discusses how IBM is leveraging AI agents internally, how Agentic AI differs from Generative AI, and the impact of the autonomy AI agents bring.\n\nQ How is IBM leveraging agentic AI? How is this different from Generative AI?\n\nI\u2019d like to start with what we\u2019re seeing in the market from an AI perspective and then transition into why agents will be fundamental to the future. At the core, LLMs today serve as the foundation for agents. In the market, almost all organisations have GenAI projects of some sort, but only a few are scaling them. Three issues act as a barrier in the journey from proof of concept (POC) to production. Number one is cost, because using models, especially large language models (LLM), has an associated cost. And what you do in a POC doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the same cost structure when operating in production.\n\nThe second area is complexity, which comes from multiple areas -- customising data and taking an LLM that may know public data, but not your data to drive the right outcomes, and responsible AI components of trust, transparency, and robustness. There\u2019s complexity because the AI system is not deterministic, so understanding how that AI works is required as it goes into essential systems.\n\nThe third is expertise, which comes from building these AI systems, and application to a particular problem. Domain expertise becomes a big part of it because AI will not do the transformation by itself, but act as an ingredient.\n\nEverybody\u2019s building agents and with different frameworks. You should be able to incorporate and build these agents to do autonomous work.\n\nWe are using our agent technologies at the intersection of AI agents and traditional automation, combining agentic AI and automation to drive process efficiencies and boost productivity in organisations. And so, we\u2019ve introduced some areas where we\u2019re driving a lot of efficiency.\n\nSome are automation and collaboration, including multi-agent collaboration. Agents are being used to enable conversational AI that goes beyond assistants that can do autonomous work on the backend.\n\nFor agents to work, the foundation is a good model that knows how to reason and that you can iterate on with your data to have the right outcomes.\n\nWe fundamentally believe much value will be captured in driving domain-specific agents, those pre-built for specific tasks. Within our portfolio, we have an agent in the HR space, which can be used to accelerate employee onboarding, candidate screening, and employee engagement.\n\nWe are also driving these domain-specific work in procurement and sales. Another thing is multi-agent orchestration to have one interaction paradigm across a number of agents.\n\nI could use an agent to communicate my vacation days or tell IBM I\u2019m taking some time off. At the same time, I could use a sales agent. Through multi-agent orchestration, I can have one interaction paradigm, interact with several agents underneath, and have a single experience where the agent determines which sub-agent is essential to call.\n\nQ What is the difference between the power GenAI brought and what AI agents might bring?\n\nGenAI uses an LLM trained on public data that may be customised. The foundation of what you\u2019re using in an LLM or an SLM is the building block for agents.\n\nYou can use an agent to plan a series of steps. For example, to build a piece of code, I may plan the steps to design it. Then, I may reflect. The reflection may use that same model to critique my code. With the LLM, you\u2019re doing a Zero-shot, which is just writing the code. Now with the agent, you\u2019re taking an iterative approach to planning how to write the code, execute, and potentially use that same model to critique that code, debug it, and rewrite it. This iterative nature gets you better accuracy than in Zero-shot learning.\n\nThe difference is you\u2019re autonomously acting with agents. I\u2019m not telling the agent every time to execute something. The agent is doing that iteration. So, the outcomes can be more accurate.\n\nQ Is agentic AI more independent of human intervention as opposed to GenAI?\n\nBy definition, AI agents can do autonomous actions. However, in many use cases where you may have had assistance before, you still can have an engaging experience.\n\nIn a conversational agent experience, you are still augmenting the human, but using agentic technology. For employee engagement, you can still have, instead of an assistant, agentic technologies underneath that enable a conversational agent-style experience. You can also have these agents operate autonomously.\n\nQ The biggest fear of AI is job displacement. If AI agents are so autonomous, where would human intervention be required?\n\nWhen we look at how Gen AI or agentic technologies are being used, it does mean teams need to understand how to utilise AI. It is about enabling and skilling our engineering teams to use the technology right. Internally in IBM, all our engineers, and even employees in different functions, use and are skilled in GenAI.\n\nFor example, sales agents. A seller\u2019s role involves understanding and researching their organisation\u2019s sales plays, then using research tools\u2014potentially including web-based tools\u2014to collect insights on target accounts. From there, they identify key contacts within those accounts and use that information for prospecting. Finally, they apply these insights to manage opportunities and advance deals through the sales pipeline.\n\nWhen you\u2019re using agentic technologies, it\u2019s also a case of a conversational interface where we\u2019re assisting the user, and it\u2019s a much more engaging and productive experience for the seller where they\u2019re probably going from opportunity identification to management in much less time with a lot more depth than earlier.\n\nQ What sectors do you think AI agents would be useful?\n\nEvery sector. There is not one industry agents will not apply to. Agentic technologies are being used in customer care and customer experience that are forward-facing, but also in back-office-facing ones. This includes sales, procurement, and HR. You can think about supply chain, manufacturing, and finance.\n\nQ Do you think the POC to production pipeline for AI agents will be more seamless than with Gen AI?\n\nI think it\u2019s early, and that there\u2019s a spectrum in agents. Of the four different use cases -- executing tasks, automating things, collaboration, and orchestration, there are some areas where agentic technologies will be more easily used.",

However, is it possible to maintain this pace of advancement? In order to do so, we must continually build upon our ability to design systems smaller and smaller. In 2023, this means operating on a scale dealing in nanometres.\n\nWith that in mind, the following publicly traded companies are examples of those leading the way, leveraging nanotechnology that spans from circuitry to displays, healthcare, and more.\n\nIBM has played a pivotal role in nanotechnology since its researchers invented the scanning tunneling microscope \u2013 a tool enabling the visualization of atomic structures. More recently, IBM developed a 2-nanometer semiconductor chip using nanosheet technology, which is set to enhance various widespread technologies from autonomous vehicles to IoT. The company believes that,\n\n\u201cAs the world becomes more instrumented, with billions of transistors embedded in everything from cars to appliances to livestock, nanotechnology will play an increasingly important role in the design of future computer chips that are smaller, smarter and more energy efficient. To achieve these performance goals, sophisticated nanotechnology processes are needed to fabricate these increasingly small transistors. Just as cells are the basic building blocks for the human body, IBM envisions a world in which nanotechnology processes are the basic building blocks for transistors and microprocessors.\u201d\n\nThis ability to scale and approach toward nanotechnology has allowed IBM to position itself as a leader in the field.\n\nA tour of the IBM Nanobiotechnology Lab\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nApplied Materials leverages its decades-long expertise in nanotechnology to provide equipment and software for semiconductor manufacturing. This includes products such as high-resolution displays, solar power, and more.\n\nThe company is particularly proficient in molecular nanotechnology, which involves the manipulation of atoms to engineer precise materials for clients around the globe.

Indra Dev Narayan, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, MECL was the guest of honour. Sh. Pankaj Kulshrestha, Chief Controller of Mines, IBM, presided over the function.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Sh. Ganvir congratulated IBM for completing 78 years of exemplary service to the nation and lauded the tremendous efforts of all retired department heads in steering the organisation right from its inception. The officers have laid a strong foundation for IBM, he said, adding that IBM contributed immensely to the mining sector by way of devising and implementing of policies. Shri Ganvir also thanked IBM for being a proactive partner of GSI in framing of various rules concerning the offshore mining sector and preparing for offshore mine auctions.\n\n\u201cThe Government has identified 30 critical minerals and has set a target to reduce the dependency of the Country for these critical minerals. IBM has initiated many initiatives such as Mining Tenement System (MTS),\u201d he said, adding that IBM and GSI are playing key roles in bringing the offshore mines to auction stage. \u201cThe partnership between GSI and IBM have essentially provided for research and exploration, scientific development of resources and conservation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe technological intervention is the need of the hour in exploring deep-seated minerals and the two organisations should continue to engage actively to meet the expectations of the industry, he said. He said the new projects initiated by IBM through use of technology have brought in more transparency in the auctions and mining operations.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Shri Indra Dev Narayan, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, MECL, said the Khanij Diwas programme is not just a matter of pride for IBM but the entire country as this organisation has been serving India for the last 78 years. He lauded IBM for its Star Ratings System that promotes sustainable mining practices and Mining Tenement System for enhancing transparency in the mining sector. He said IBM is doing a commendable job in the fast changing landscape of minerals and mining sector.\n\nHe said IBM plays a key role in securing mineral resources and systematic utilisation and conservation of the important minerals in the country. The department is contributing immensely to the field of mineral beneficiation, he added.\n\nShri Narayan said Nagpur hosts a \u201cMining Kumbh\u201d as the city serves as the \u2018Sangam\u2019 (confluence) of GSI, IBM and MECL. He also foresaw challenges in the mining sector in the future and asked IBM to be prepared for these challenges.\n\nShri Pankaj Kulshrestha, CCOM (MES), in his presidential address, said IBM has come a long way and threw light on its journey from this day in 1948. He underscored the role played by IBM in providing support to the Ministry of Mines with data and queries as and when sought by it. He said Critical Minerals is a very important area these days and Government of India is trying to make the country self-reliant in terms of these minerals.\n\nHe said IBM is at the forefront of digitisation with implementation of e-Office, Mining Surveillance System, MTS modules and drone technology in monitoring of mining areas.\n\nShri Kulshrestha also agreed that there are challenging times ahead but exuded confidence that the Department and the Mining Sector shall overcome these challenges.\n\nHe also referred to the recent amendments bringing four minor minerals under major minerals category, saying IBM\u2019s regional offices need to brace for increased workload and more responsibilities in future due to addition of these minerals as Major Minerals. Earlier, the programme commenced with lighting of traditional lamp, singing of devotional song, introduction of the Chief Guest and the Guest of Honour and felicitation of the dignitaries.\n\nDr V.A.J Aruna, Superintending Officer (Ore Dressing), Shri D.N.Bhargava, retired Controller General and others were present.\n\nSmt.

            "content": "Quantum computing stocks are receiving outsized attention as it emerges as AI's newest breakthrough.\n\nFor the last couple of years, investors have learned how artificial intelligence (AI) is paving the way for a new frontier in the technology sector. At this point, it's common knowledge that AI is used for developing software, building large language models (LLMs), and even training autonomous vehicles.\n\nWhile these applications are exciting, a new pocket of the AI realm is starting to receive quite a bit of attention. Stocks including Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and IonQ have witnessed quite a bit of action over the last few months, as each of these companies claims to be leading the charge in AI's \"next big thing\" -- quantum computing.\n\nThe temptation to follow momentum into little-known opportunities is very real. After all, what if one of these companies becomes the next millionaire-maker AI stock?\n\nAlthough I understand this line of thinking, I'd encourage potential investors to take a step back and remember that Rigetti, D-Wave, and IonQ were all penny stocks less than a year ago. Instead of buying into a narrative, investors are better off focusing on existing leaders in the AI market and assessing which of those companies may parlay its accomplishments into quantum computing.\n\nLet's explore two companies that I think are poised to make a splash in the quantum computing arena, and assess why each looks like a great buy right now.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nMy hunch is that you're already familiar with Alphabet (GOOG 0.18%) (GOOGL 0.07%) since the company operates two of the most visited websites on the internet -- Google and YouTube.\n\nWhile Alphabet derives most of its sales through advertising, the company has made investments in AI-powered services to bolster its business model, which now supports workplace productivity tools akin to Microsoft's Office suite, cybersecurity solutions, cloud computing infrastructure, and hardware devices such as mobile phones.\n\nIn addition to its existing AI products, Alphabet has also been quietly exploring the area of quantum computing. Back in December, the company revealed that its quantum chip, dubbed Willow, demonstrated reduced error rates and astonishingly fast computational speeds during an experiment. Specifically, Willow's superior processing power solved a problem in five minutes that would otherwise have taken the most sophisticated supercomputers 10 septillion years to crack.\n\nIndeed, this is impressive work from Alphabet. But I think this case study underscores one thing above all else: Quantum computing doesn't have much application today, given where things currently stand in the AI revolution.\n\nNevertheless, I actually see that dynamic as a benefit for Alphabet. The company already has an established footprint in the AI market, and given Alphabet's hugely profitable business, the company has the financial flexibility to explore and build best-in-class products in emerging areas.\n\nSo even if Willow isn't a money-making machine for Alphabet today, the company's accomplishments have me optimistic that quantum computing will at some point become further integrated into Alphabet's existing AI suite, further separating the company from an intense competitive landscape.\n\n2. IBM\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM -0.01%) has developed a series of quantum computing processors known as Heron, Condor, Eagle, and Osprey. However, it's the company's software platform that has me most excited.\n\nIBM offers a quantum computing software application called Qiskit. Qiskit is a software suite marketed toward quantum developers. Some of the selling points of the platform are that it helps streamline workflows, assists with code generation, and provides cloud-based infrastructure to run workloads across various devices.\n\nFor me, IBM is flying under the radar in both the AI race and specific quantum computing use cases. While many quantum computing companies are still experimenting in theory-based advancements, IBM has a unique opportunity to build end-to-end quantum infrastructure through a combination of its hardware processors and the Qiskit software suite. This could be a major differentiator from other companies developing quantum computing products and one that could help IBM begin to really scale as the AI movement heats up.",

            "content": "IBM to Enhance Watsonx Portfolio Through DataStax Acquisition\n\nIBM has announced it will acquire AI and data solutions provider DataStax, in a move aimed at enhancing its watsonx portfolio and advancing generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for enterprises. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe acquisition will integrate DataStax's vector database and AI-driven data management capabilities into IBM's expanding AI ecosystem, addressing the challenge enterprises face in unlocking value from vast amounts of unstructured data.\n\n\"Businesses cannot realize the full potential of generative AI without the right infrastructure \u2014 open source tools and technologies that empower developers, harness unstructured data, and provide a strong foundation for AI applications,\" said Dinesh Nirmal, senior vice president of IBM Software, in a statement. \"DataStax possesses deep competency in this area and shares IBM's relentless commitment to simplifying and scaling generative AI for the enterprise.\"\n\nDataStax is known for AstraDB and DataStax Enterprise, its NoSQL and vector database solutions built on Apache Cassandra, as well as Langflow, an open source tool for low-code AI application development. IBM said it plans to continue supporting and developing Apache Cassandra, Langflow, and other open source initiatives such as Apache Pulsar and OpenSearch, reinforcing its commitment to open AI ecosystems.\n\n\"I've had the awesome privilege to be part of the DataStax journey for the last five-plus years and I couldn't be more excited for our next chapter,\" said Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO at DataStax, in a post on LinkedIn. \"We have long said that there is no AI without data, and this vision will now be amplified with IBM.\"\n\nWith AI adoption increasing across industries, IBM's acquisition of DataStax aims to bridge a critical gap in enterprise AI deployment. The industry analysts at McKinsey estimate that only 1% of enterprise data is currently utilized in AI models, while 70% of companies with high-performing AI initiatives still face data-related challenges. DataStax's technology is expected to enhance IBM watsonx.data, IBM's hybrid data lakehouse for AI and analytics, by enabling enterprises to manage and leverage unstructured data more effectively.\n\nDataStax's solutions are used by major corporations, including FedEx, Capital One, The Home Depot, and Verizon. The company, founded in 2010 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, has been instrumental in advancing database technology for AI workloads.\n\n\"Enterprises want to deliver production AI fast but are still struggling to unlock the value in their data to power AI applications and agents,\" said Kapoor. \"DataStax's products solve this problem, accelerating AI's promise with the scalability, security, and accuracy developers and enterprises need.\"\n\nIBM continues to expand its footprint in AI and hybrid cloud solutions, leveraging open source innovation to drive its enterprise AI strategy. This latest acquisition follows its ongoing efforts to enhance AI-driven data solutions and provide scalable infrastructure for organizations navigating the evolving AI landscape.",

            "content": "Sevilla F\u00fatbol Club (Sevilla FC), based in the southern Spanish city of Seville, are seven-time Europa League champions.\n\nTalent scouting in the Europa League is competitive, so Sevilla FC have worked to stay ahead. And with more data in their hands than ever before \u2013 Sevilla FC have over 300,000 scouting reports to use for recruiting new players \u2013 they need a way to turn that information into real-world talent.\n\nTo analyze and make use of their soccer talent data, Sevilla FC\u2019s data department partnered with IBM to create Scout Advisor, a generative AI-driven scouting tool designed and built on watsonx, IBM\u2019s portfolio of AI products, with Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 70B Instruct model.\n\n\u201cScout Advisor uses Llama 3.1 70B Instruct\u2019s advanced natural language processing to bridge the gap between qualitative human insights and quantitative data analysis,\u201d says Elias Zamora, Chief Data Officer (CDO) for Sevilla FC. \u201cThis fusion enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of our scouting operations, ensuring that our recruitment strategies are both data-driven and deeply informed by human expertise.\u201d\n\nMaking Scouting Report Searches Easier\n\nTo make recruiting decisions, Sevilla FC needed to assess qualities like attitude, tenacity and leadership across a large volume of scouting reports. Without Scout Advisor, recruiters had to spend 200 to 300 hours analyzing a single shortlist of players.\n\nNow Sevilla FC\u2019s recruiters can simply ask Scout Advisor a question about the soccer talent they\u2019re looking for to see a list of matching players, including precise AI-generated summaries of their performance. IBM\u2019s watsonx and Meta\u2019s Llama enable Sevilla FC to bridge the gap between traditional human-centric and data-driven scouting in the identification and characterization of potential recruits.\n\nHaving such an effective operation for scouting players has helped Sevilla FC attract talent, while generating opportunities from other teams who want to use AI for help.\n\nLearning to Talk Soccer\n\nBuilt with IBM\u2019s watsonx and leveraging Llama, Scout Advisor is able to comprehend soccer-industry terms and answer questions accurately.\n\nThrough prompt enrichment, Scout Advisor automatically optimizes questions to get the best possible results from the AI solution. Prompt enrichment ensures that soccer-specific questions give the agent enough context for a thorough analysis of Sevilla FC\u2019s scouting reports.\n\nFor example, a simple query like \u201cshow me talented wings\u201d automatically gets refined with soccer-specific information, so that search results look right: \u201cA talented wing takes on defenders with dribbling, creating space and penetrating the opposition.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, a general-purpose model\u2019s response might include irrelevant results, like a chicken wing recipe.\n\n\u201cWe selected Llama 3.1 70B for its text enrichment and summarization performance, particularly in the Spanish language,\u201d Zamora says.\n\nStrong Results for Scout Advisor\n\nSince implementing Scout Advisor, Sevilla FC have improved their scouting process with shorter evaluation time, enhanced talent identification, a stronger competitive edge and new consulting opportunities and revenue streams.\n\n\u201cThis is a revolutionary tool for a football director. I don\u2019t need to review 45 reports for a player to know what my scouting department thinks of them,\u201d says Victor Orta, Sporting Director at Sevilla FC. \u201cIn perhaps two minutes, I can get all the information that I need to make a decision.\u201d\n\nFor those inspired by their AI initiatives, Zamora says it\u2019s crucial to have a solid data foundation, deep business understanding and a well-educated team. In the future, Sevilla FC plans to evaluate new versions of Llama to keep refining Scout Advisor\u2019s capabilities, helping them keep their leading edge in sports AI.",

On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 2% year over year. The top line exceeded the consensus estimate of $17.51 billion. Gross profit improved to $10.44 billion from $10.23 billion in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 59.5% and 59.1% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses increased to $7.13 billion from $6.51 billion due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the reported quarter was $2.91 billion or $3.09 per share compared with $3.29 billion or $3.55 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline in GAAP earnings was due to high operating expenses. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $3.92 per share compared with $3.87 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19 cents. For 2024, IBM reported net income of $6.02 billion or $6.43 per share compared with $7.5 billion or $8.14 per share in 2023. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $10.33 per share compared with $9.62 in 2023.\n\nThe company witnessed healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth. IBM exceeded the target metrics related to revenue, profitability and cash flow growth that it laid out for the three-year mid-term model at the end of 2021. Despite economic uncertainty due to geopolitical issues, supply chain vulnerabilities, incessant cyber threats and the evolving landscape of interest rates and inflation levels, the company expects to deliver sustainable growth with advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for IBM (IBM). Shares have lost about 2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nSoftware: Revenues improved to $7.92 billion from $7.18 billion, driven by growth in Red Hat (up 17%), Automation (16%), Data & AI (5%), Security (5%) and Transaction Processing (11%). The segment\u2019s revenues beat our estimate of $7.43 billion on solid hybrid cloud traction. Segment profit was $3.1 billion compared with $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter for margins of 39.2% and 36.9%, respectively. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation and generative AI offerings like watsonx.\n\n\n\nConsulting: Revenues were $5.17 billion compared with $5.28 billion a year ago as clients prioritized spending and pulled back on discretionary projects. The segment\u2019s revenues missed our estimate of $5.39 billion. Segment profit declined to $606 million from $654 million for margins of 11.7% and 12.4%, respectively.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure: Revenues were $4.26 billion compared with $4.6 billion on lower demand for hybrid and distributed infrastructure, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Segment profit was $1.06 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, owing to higher investments in the business across areas like AI, hybrid cloud and quantum, for respective margins of 25% and 28.2%.\n\n\n\nFinancing: Revenues declined to $170 million from $175 million a year ago. Segment profit was down to $94 million from $117 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 55% and 67%.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nDuring the quarter, IBM generated $4.33 billion in cash from operations compared with $4.46 billion in the year-ago quarter, bringing the respective tallies for 2024 and 2023 to $13.44 billion and $13.93 billion. Free cash flow was $6.16 billion in the quarter, up from $6.09 billion in the prior-year period, driven by higher profit and working capital efficiencies. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had $13.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $49.88 billion of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $13.07 billion and $50.12 billion a year ago.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2025, the company expects revenues to grow at least 5% on a constant currency basis driven by a strong portfolio mix, operating leverage and yield from productivity initiatives. Free cash flow is expected to be in the vicinity of $13.5 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -9.1% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, IBM has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, IBM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nIBM is part of the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry. Over the past month, Seagate (STX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.4%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2024 more than a month ago.\n\nSeagate reported revenues of $2.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.5%. EPS of $2.03 for the same period compares with $0.12 a year ago.\n\nSeagate is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +427.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1%.\n\nSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

            "content": "IBM has finally completed the $6.4 billion takeover of Hashicorp days after Britain's competition regulator gave the corporate marriage its seal of approval.\n\nThe eye-wateringly expensive buy was first signposted in April to make IBM's hybrid cloud platform more \"comprehensive,\" with Hashicorp's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool Terraform set to sync with Red Hat's Ansible under the Big Blue roof.\n\n\"Organizations globally are looking to deploy modern, hybrid cloud-ready apps, which require automated cloud infrastructure at significant scale,\" said IBM Software senior veep and chief commercial officer Rob Thomas.\n\nIBM Consulting workers told management wants to 'more closely align pay, performance' READ MORE\n\nThe aim? \"To infuse Hashicorp technology in every datacenter,\" he added.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of Hashicorp's revenue comes from the US and just a fifth of Forbes Global 2000 are users. With 75 percent of customers spending $100k in annual recurring revenue, IBM thinks its global sales tentacles can help boost the commercials further.\n\nAnalyst 6Sense puts Terraform, Hashicorp's IaC tool, at number one in terms of configuration management market share, holding onto just about a third of the category, with Ansible very closely behind at number two.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, IBM will slide secrets manager Vault, portable software development platform creator Vagrant and machine image builder Packer alongside the Red Hat portfolio.\n\nOne thing IBM didn't mention when talking about the takeover was Hashicorp's seeming misstep in November 2023 when it forgot its historical roots by abandoning use of the Mozilla Public License in favor of the semi-proprietary Business Source License for previously open source programs.\n\nThe highest profile impact was to Terraform, as developers rebelled against the competition-limiting BSL and created a fork, OpenTF. This fork was subsequently renamed to OpenTofu out of fears about trademark infringement. It is now overseen by The Linux Foundation.\n\nVault is another open source fork that happened, with OpenBao launching in December 2023.\n\nThese decisions upset developers and customers and following the BSL move, Hashicorp's share price sunk to $21.11, sliding 22 percent from its October 2023 earnings.\n\nUnperturbed, IBM stepped in and offered $35 per share, amounting to $6.4 billion. The decision resulted in IBM's share price sliding by high single digits as investors scratched their heads. IBM's market cap has since rallied: CEO Arvind Krishna convinced the market that its hybrid cloud and software aspirations have merit.\n\nThe FTC had opened an antitrust review in July and UK regulator the Competition and Markets Authority did the same in December. The CMA this week said it had \"cleared the anticipated acquisition by IBM of HashiCorp\" but didn't specify its reasons for doing so.\n\nAs such, IBM has finally managed to slip the ring on Hashicorp's finger in what Krishna views as a friendlier regulatory environment to pursue other biz targets, like DataStax. \u00ae",

            "content": "When working on large language models, IBM principal research scientist Prasanna Sattigeri found they could potentially be made to say some shocking things. \"Stop eating so much and exercise, it's super simple fatty,\u201d one might tell a user. \u201cI'd like to give her something to cry about,\u201d another might say. These are not exactly the sort of statements that most businesses would want enterprise chatbots spewing, he thought.\n\nThis week, IBM announced the latest generation of Granite models, including two new additions to the Granite Guardian series: Granite Guardian 3.2 5B and Granite Guardian 3.2 mixture of experts (MoE) 3B. The Granite Guardian 3.2 5B model is a pruned version of Granite Guardian 8B, which is itself fine-tuned from IBM\u2019s enterprise-grade Granite series of LLMs.\n\nThese new Guardian models also have additional capabilities. They can now detect harm in multi-turn conversations and can verbalize the model\u2019s uncertainty. \u201cBy reducing from 8 billion to 5 billion parameters, we\u2019ve improved the inference time 1.44 times without a loss of accuracy,\u201d said IBM research software engineer Tejaswini Pedapati. \u201cThis will be a boon to customers that want to efficiently guardrail their applications.\u201d Our earlier models were found to be superior to similar models like Llama Guard 3 8B on the complete Surge AI toxicity dataset (with the Guardian model achieving a 0.957 F1 score, compared to Llama Guard\u2019s 0.427).\n\n\u201cWe have a winning lottery ticket with Granite Guardian 3.2 5B,\u201d Pedapati said. Despite having additional capabilities, the pruned model has an F1 score of 0.943, a minimal drop over the 8 billion parameter model the team started from.\n\nDue to the significant computational resources needed to deploy larger models and the high latency in responding to user requests, there is a growing demand for smaller models that are still performant. The technique used to get to 5 billion parameters is known as iterative post-training structured pruning and healing.\n\nInspired by a recent paper describing an algorithm to identify redundant layers in LLMs, the IBM team pruned layers with high cosine similarity between the input and output. \u201cLayers that do not transform the input significantly can be removed without significantly altering the entire network\u2019s output,\u201d said IBM research scientist Pierre Dognin. \u201cWe conjecture that the layers at the beginning of the network are responsible for feature extraction and those at the end of the network are essential for decision making and therefore must remain untouched.\u201d\n\nThe layers are ranked by maximum cosine similarity values, and the top K layers located between the 10th to 30th layers are selected for removal. The pruned model is then \u201chealed\u201d (or, re-trained) on a subset of the original training data to recoup its performance. The team observed that an iterative pruning approach \u2014 where a small number of layers of the model are pruned, the resulting model is healed, and then the process is repeated \u2014 leads to better results than pruning many layers in one shot.\n\nTaking into consideration the need for faster response times and low computational cost, the IBM researchers also developed a delegation method that routes the queries either to the Granite Guardian 3.2 3B MoE model or the Granite Guardian 5B model based on their confidence estimates.\n\nThe performance of the 5B model and 3B MoE models on various benchmarks are included in their model cards.\n\nOn the above chart, the blue plot shows that as we increase the number of data points that are sent to the smaller model, although the latency and the computational requirements are lower, the accuracy does steadily drop from 78.5% to less than 72%. This drop in performance is alleviated by calibrating the 3B model on Granite Guardian 5B\u2019s predictions as indicated in the orange curve. Instead of dropping below 72%, the performance of the 3B is now 75.5%.\n\nFor the best performance, a combination of the calibrated 3B MoE model and the 5B model is recommended, while considering the tradeoff of accuracy and computation cost. An example could be to choose the threshold such that the calibrated 3B MoE model covers 70% of the traffic and the remaining 30% is handled by the 5B model. This results in a stable overall performance of roughly 78%-78.5%, with a big computational advantage to handle the full traffic with the 5B model.",

The status of overseas cybersecurity staff delegated under the contract\u2019s terms was not immediately known.\n\nThe Trump administration said Wednesday that it\u2019s slashing 90% of USAID contracts. USAID canceled nearly 5,800 of its 6,200 multi-year awards, slashing $54 billion in funding \u2014 an overall reduction of 92%, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday. The White House also trimmed almost 30% of the State Department\u2019s foreign aid grants, around $4.4 billion.\n\nThe IBM project supported USAID\u2019s Cybersecurity Protection and Response program and was fueled in part by accelerated cyberattacks targeting European and Eurasian nations that have stemmed from Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been to that part of the world, it\u2019s really tough to build a national system for managing internet use,\u201d Mike Purcell, a retired Marine officer who focused on Eurasian security cooperation, previously told Nextgov/FCW. \u201cAnd it would be in the U.S.\u2019s interest if it\u2019s able to link [the countries] into a reliable, safe internet and cyberspace connected to Western Europe and their economies.\u201d\n\nThe foreign aid agency, which has become a prime target of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to eliminate government spending waste, declared cybersecurity an economic development issue in 2021 and has been pushing to boost the technical prowess of underdeveloped nations, arguing those investments can help curtail cyberattacks launched by foreign adversaries and cybercrime groups.\n\nThe contract with the technology services giant contained both proactive and reactive components, a USAID technical expert previously told Nextgov/FCW. One reactive piece gave USAID the ability to direct IBM to deploy a rapid response team within 72 hours of a cyber incident and perform forensic analysis or system recovery.\n\nAs part of a renewed digital solidarity effort unveiled by the State Department last year, Western officials hoped that worldwide coalition-building would help deter hacking threats against critical infrastructure. Hackers tied to Russia, China and others have been found to be burrowing into and sabotaging critical economic sectors \u2014 including water systems and healthcare providers \u2014 over the past several years.\n\nNextgov/FCW has asked the State Department and USAID for comment. The moves to eliminate much of the humanitarian agency\u2019s business have been undergirded by what Trump officials call an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. has worked to counter foreign influence over internet and telecom standards that could lead to cyber threats and geopolitical instability. Russia, for instance, has been accused of human rights abuses via its cyberattacks targeting Ukraine.\n\nNotably, recent U.S. diplomatic initiatives indicate that the White House is actively engaging with Moscow, a strategy that Ukraine supporters in Washington contend could jeopardize U.S. national security and the stability of NATO allies.",

This license change likely made HashiCorp a more appealing acquisition prospect, giving suitors more control over how Terraform is used in industry.\n\nAt any rate, Terraform\u2019s ability to help companies provision their infrastructure (i.e. configure the various hardware, software, and network components required to run applications and services) on-premises and across clouds, fits well with an IBM strategy that has evolved from on-prem systems to the cloud \u2014 a strategy that seems to be paying off.\n\nBig Blue flies high\n\nIBM is one of several legacy software companies riding the AI and cloud computing wave, with \u201cBig Blue\u201d hitting an all-time high valuation of more than $240 billion this year.

And on Tuesday this week, IBM announced plans to acquire Apache Cassandra vendor DataStax for an undisclosed figure.\n\nIBM had initially indicated that it expected to close the HashiCorp transaction by the end of 2024, but regulatory red-tape had held things up. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last July revealed that the FTC was reviewing details of the planned merger, while the U.K.\u2019s CMA followed suit in December.\n\nWith both the FTC and CMA out the way, this paved the way for IBM to conclude the deal within a couple of days.",

The White House also trimmed almost 30% of the State Department\u2019s foreign aid grants, around $4.4 billion.\n\nThe IBM project supported USAID\u2019s Cybersecurity Protection and Response program and was fueled in part by accelerated cyberattacks targeting European and Eurasian nations that have stemmed from Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been to that part of the world, it\u2019s really tough to build a national system for managing internet use,\u201d Mike Purcell, a retired Marine officer who focused on Eurasian security cooperation, previously told Nextgov/FCW. \u201cAnd it would be in the U.S.\u2019s interest if it\u2019s able to link [the countries] into a reliable, safe internet and cyberspace connected to Western Europe and their economies.\u201d\n\nThe foreign aid agency, which has become a prime target of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to eliminate government spending waste, declared cybersecurity an economic development issue in 2021 and has been pushing to boost the technical prowess of underdeveloped nations, arguing those investments can help curtail cyberattacks launched by foreign adversaries and cybercrime groups.\n\nThe contract with the technology services giant contained both proactive and reactive components, a USAID technical expert previously told Nextgov/FCW. One reactive piece gave USAID the ability to direct IBM to deploy a rapid response team within 72 hours of a cyber incident and perform forensic analysis or system recovery.\n\nAs part of a renewed digital solidarity effort unveiled by the State Department last year, Western officials hoped that worldwide coalition-building would help deter hacking threats against critical infrastructure. Hackers tied to Russia, China and others have been found to be burrowing into and sabotaging critical economic sectors \u2014 including water systems and healthcare providers \u2014 over the past several years.\n\nNextgov/FCW has asked the State Department and USAID for comment. The moves to eliminate much of the humanitarian agency\u2019s business have been undergirded by what Trump officials call an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. has worked to counter foreign influence over internet and telecom standards that could lead to cyber threats and geopolitical instability. Russia, for instance, has been accused of human rights abuses via its cyberattacks targeting Ukraine.\n\nNotably, recent U.S. diplomatic initiatives indicate that the White House is actively engaging with Moscow, a strategy that Ukraine supporters in Washington contend could jeopardize U.S. national security and the stability of NATO allies.",

            "content": "In its quest to carve out a niche in the enterprise AI market, IBM is introducing a new family of its Granite AI models. These models include experimental reasoning capabilities and visual processing capabilities.\n\nThis reports SiliconANGLE. The new model family includes the flagship Granite 3.2 Instruct model, a text-based large language model available in 8B and 2B versions. IBM designed this model for tasks such as summarization, problem solving, and code generation and optimized it to follow instructions.\n\nThis type of model is particularly suitable for developing AI assistants and agents. The manufacturer trained both variants with chain-of-thought reasoning, similar to other leading models. However, IBM designed them to be smaller and more efficient.\n\nA notable feature of the models is that reasoning capabilities can be programmable to turn on and off. Instead of releasing separate reasoning models, IBM developed one that is both a conversational model and a reasoning model. Since reasoning requires a lot of processing power, disabling it at runtime provides significant energy savings.\n\nReward system for LLM\n\nReasoning models analyze problems step by step, a method known in the industry as chain of thought. Since the introduction of DeepSeeks R1, the demand for such models has increased dramatically. Most reasoning models scan an entire reasoning space to find the best logical route before generating a final answer. IBM, however, developed an innovative inference technique that improves computational efficiency. It does so by adding a reward system.\n\nThis system uses an additional assessment model that adjusts the LLM to the most likely correct outcome in real time. Thanks to a clever search technique, which allows the system to search the entire reasoning space, IBM was able to develop a smaller and more efficient reasoning model compared to R1, which performs this process all at once.\n\nIBM states that Granite 3.2 8B can compete with larger models such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI GPT-4o on mathematical reasoning tests such as AIME2024 and MATH500.\n\nMore efficient security model\n\nIn addition to the reasoning models, IBM also introduced Granite Vision 3.2 2B. This multimodal model with computer vision functionality is designed to help companies with visual document analysis.\n\nGranite Vision can perform a variety of visual tasks but excels, especially in document processing. Many visual language models (VLMs) are optimized for general vision tasks but do not score as well on optical character recognition (OCR) and text extraction. IBM\u2019s engineering team, therefore, spent considerable time training Vision 3.2 on unique visual features such as layouts, fonts, diagrams and infographics.\n\nIn addition, IBM introduced Granite Guardian 3.2. This is the latest model in its suite of AI security models, designed to detect risk in prompts and responses. It performs similarly to its predecessor (3.1) but is faster and cheaper to use.\n\nA key improvement in Guardian 3.2 is the introduction of verbalized confidence. The model indicates not only a binary yes or no but also a confidence level such as high or low. This helps developers better judge whether to trust or reject an AI outcome.\n\nIn addition to the updated 8B version, IBM also released two new model sizes: a slimmed-down 5 billion-parameter version, which provides almost the same performance as the original, and Granite 3.2 3B-A800M, a model based on the Mixture-of-Experts technique, which activates only 800 million of its 3 billion parameters at a time to reduce costs without sacrificing performance.\n\nAdvanced trend forecasting\n\nFinally, IBM introduced a new compact time series model called Granite Timeseries, or Tiny Time Mixers. The latest variant, Granite-Timeseries-TTM-R2.1, expands its capabilities to include daily and weekly forecasts up to two years ahead.\n\nTime series models are particularly useful for forecasting long-term trends in finance, economics, supply chain management and seasonal inventory planning in retail.",

While chain of thought approaches for reasoning are powerful, they require substantial compute power that is not necessary for every task. That is why IBM has introduced the ability to turn chain of thought on or off programmatically. For simpler tasks, the model can operate without reasoning to reduce unnecessary compute overhead. Additionally, other reasoning techniques like inference scaling have shown that the Granite 3.2 8B model can match or exceed the performance of much larger models on standard math reasoning benchmarks. Evolving methods like inference scaling remains a key area of focus for IBM's research teams.4\n\nAlongside Granite 3.2 instruct, vision, and guardrail models, IBM is releasing the next generation of its TinyTimeMixers (TTM) models (sub 10M parameters), with capabilities for longer-term forecasting up to two years into the future. These make for powerful tools in long-term trend analysis, including finance and economics trends, supply chain demand forecasting and seasonal inventory planning in retail.\n\n\"The next era of AI is about efficiency, integration, and real-world impact \u2013 where enterprises can achieve powerful outcomes without excessive spend on compute,\" said Sriram Raghavan, VP, IBM AI Research. \"IBM's latest Granite developments focus on open solutions demonstrate another step forward in making AI more accessible, cost-effective, and valuable for modern enterprises.\"\n\nTo learn more about Granite 3.2, read this technical article.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

Because the system has always-on hardware-assisted compression, IBM says it has 2.3 PB of effective capacity.\n\nBuilding a 2 PB archive system with the 5045, meaning 100 disk drives, \u201cwould need 15RU,\u201d which compares badly to the C200\u2019s 2RU for 2.3 PB. The 5045\u2019s nearline SAS HDDs could deliver 4-5 ms if not very active. \u201cWith one that is under reasonable load we are talking more like 10 ms. Push them beyond their couple of hundred IOPS and you can easily expect 30 ms or more!\u201d\n\nEven building a 2.3 PB archive box with Western Digital 32 TB disk drives would need 72 drives and they would be slower to access than the C200\u2019s FCMs.\n\nThe C200 has 8 x 10GbE onboard ports and supports both Ethernet (8 x 25/10GbE NVMe-TCP) and Fibre Channel (16 x 32GbE FC/NVMe-FC) optional ports. It can operate as a member of a FlashSystem federated grid (connected set) of systems, providing an in-grid archive tier, \u201cenabling non-disruptive Storage Partition migration between systems.\u201d The prior 5045 system did not support that capability.\n\nWe\u2019re told that a \u201cFlashSystem grid acts as an intelligent interconnect between storage arrays to provide a single point of management for your entire storage estate. This facilitates the movement of data within a smart partition by maintaining the context and integrity of associated data services including snapshots, replication, and backup.\u201d The partitions include metadata and additional features of the grid to make this approach to data mobility possible. IBM says: \u201cData and applications are always on a performant storage tier and have the capacity they need to meet end-user expectations.\u201d\n\nThe FCM Gen 4 drives have always-on encryption \u201cand ransomware threat detection with guaranteed detection in 1 minute,\u201d IBM says. The C200 has energy efficiency and zero downtime guarantees.\n\nIBM provides indicative end-user pricing for its FlashSystems, and the C200 has what you might call a respectable price:\n\n5045 \u2013 70 TB to 175 TB with HDDs: $17,500 to $23,100\n\n5045 \u2013 9 TB to 30 TB all-flash: $20,800 to $35,100\n\n5300 \u2013 45 TB to 680 TB configs: $52,200 to $247,200\n\n7300 \u2013 85 TB to 1.5 PB: $117,600 to $540,500\n\n9500 \u2013 365 TB to 1.4 PB: $428,800 to \u201cContact IBM for pricing\u201d\n\nC200 \u2013 2.3 PB: $381,000\n\nWhyte claims: \u201cThe writing really is on the wall for the last of the spinning rust\u2026 over the next few years we will see the price point for flash get closer and closer, and eventually even reduce lower than NL-SAS. With 300, 500, and even 1 PB flash drives being teased in the industry, it\u2019s almost impossible for even the most advanced magnetic platter technologies to keep up.\u201d\n\nThis chimes with the message about NAND replacing disk drives that Pure Storage has been putting out.\n\nFlashSystem C200 will be generally available worldwide on March 21.\n\nBootnote\n\nIBM blogger Chelsey Gosse says: \u201cIndustry-standard QLC expects about 1,000 P/E (i.e.: write) cycles, https://www.solved.scality.com/is-all-flash-the-best-choice/, whereas FlashCore Module 4 drives, which are in the C200, achieve 5,500 P/E cycles prior to wear out, using internal testing developed using the JEDEC Standards for Retention.\u201d",

Slimmed-down size options for Granite Guardian safety models that maintain performance of previous Granite 3.1 Guardian models at 30% reduction in size. The 3.2 models also introduce a new feature called verbalized confidence, which offers more nuanced risk assessment that acknowledges ambiguity in safety monitoring.\n\nIBM's strategy to deliver smaller, specialized AI models for enterprises continues to demonstrate efficacy in testing, with the Granite 3.1 8B model recently yielding high marks on accuracy in the Salesforce LLM Benchmark for CRM.\n\nThe Granite model family is supported by a robust ecosystem of partners, including leading software companies embedding the LLMs into their technologies.\n\n\"At CrushBank, we've seen first-hand how IBM's open, efficient AI models deliver real value for enterprise AI \u2013 offering the right balance of performance, cost-effectiveness, and scalability,\" said David Tan, CTO, CrushBank. \"Granite 3.2 takes it further with new reasoning capabilities, and we're excited to explore them in building new agentic solutions.\"\n\nGranite 3.2 is an important step in the evolution of IBM's portfolio and strategy to deliver small, practical AI for enterprises. While chain of thought approaches for reasoning are powerful, they require substantial compute power that is not necessary for every task. That is why IBM has introduced the ability to turn chain of thought on or off programmatically. For simpler tasks, the model can operate without reasoning to reduce unnecessary compute overhead. Additionally, other reasoning techniques like inference scaling have shown that the Granite 3.2 8B model can match or exceed the performance of much larger models on standard math reasoning benchmarks. Evolving methods like inference scaling remains a key area of focus for IBM's research teams.4\n\nAlongside Granite 3.2 instruct, vision, and guardrail models, IBM is releasing the next generation of its TinyTimeMixers (TTM) models (sub 10M parameters), with capabilities for longer-term forecasting up to two years into the future. These make for powerful tools in long-term trend analysis, including finance and economics trends, supply chain demand forecasting and seasonal inventory planning in retail.\n\n\"The next era of AI is about efficiency, integration, and real-world impact \u2013 where enterprises can achieve powerful outcomes without excessive spend on compute,\" said Sriram Raghavan, VP, IBM AI Research. \"IBM's latest Granite developments focus on open solutions demonstrate another step forward in making AI more accessible, cost-effective, and valuable for modern enterprises.\"\n\nTo learn more about Granite 3.2, read this technical article.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

Our combined technology will capture richer, more nuanced representations of knowledge, ultimately leading to more efficient and accurate outcomes,\u201d Gunnar said.\n\n\u201cWe have long said that there is no AI without data, and this vision will now be propelled as DataStax joins IBM,\u201d DataStax CEO Chet Kapoor said in his own blog post about the acquisition deal. \u201cWith our technologies and IBM\u2019s Watsonx.data, their hybrid, open data lakehouse, we will be able to bring vector and AI search to the entire data estate and make IBM\u2019s capabilities available to every developer.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its database, DataStax\u2019s product portfolio also includes Astra Streaming for building real-time data pipelines, the DataStax AI Platform for building and deploying AI applications, and an enterprise AI platform that incorporates Nvidia AI technology.\n\n\u201cBy harnessing DataStax's expertise in managing large-scale, unstructured data and combining it with Watsonx's innovative data AI solutions, we will provide enterprise ready data for AI with better data performance, search relevancy, and overall operational efficiency,\u201d Gunnar said.\n\nAnother key attraction for IBM is DataStax\u2019s Langflow open-source, low-code tools for developing AI applications that use retrieval augmented generation (RAG). DataStax acquired those tools in April 2024 when it bought Langflow, the company.\n\n\u201cLangflow empowers developers to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy RAG and multi-agent AI applications with simplicity,\u201d Gunnar wrote. \u201cBy providing a low-code interface, it simplifies the complex integration of generative AI models, data processing, and AI workflows, enabling developers to focus on creating intelligent generative AI applications rather than managing technical integrations and complexity associated with building AI applications.\u201d\n\nIBM did not disclose financial details of the planned acquisition, which is expected to be completed sometime in the second quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nDataStax, founded in 2010 and headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., is privately held. The company raised $115 million in a private equity funding round led by Goldman Sachs in June 2022. Altogether the company raised $342.6 million, according to the Crunchbase website.\n\nIBM is in the process of acquiring HashiCorp, a developer of infrastructure and security automation tools, for $6.4 billion. While that acquisition was originally slated to close by the end of 2024, it has been held up by regulators, including in the U.K. But on Tuesday the U.K. regulatory body, The Competition and Markets Authority, posted a notice saying the CMA had cleared IBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp.",

In 2016, Datastax, the biggest donor to Apache Cassandra, drew back on its support for the database project, prompting criticism within the community.\n\nBy way of a peace offering, DataStax donated tools it developed in building its AstraDB database service to the community to help with deployments in Kubernetes, including Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, Reaper, a tool designed to manage the maintenance and repair tasks for a Cassandra cluster, and Medusa, a way to back up and restore data.\n\n\"Like any good family, you're going to have fights,\" Patrick McFadin, Apache Cassandra and developer relations veep at DataStax, said at the time.

And so in December, the CMA launched an early \u201cphase 1\u201d investigation, inviting comment from key stakeholders.\n\nWhile it was never certain to proceed to a full-blown investigation, it\u2019s worth noting that the U.K. has been pushing to portray itself as a pro-tech, pro-growth nation of late \u2014 and this has meant changes at the CMA.\n\nLast month, the government appointed a new CMA chairperson in the form of ex-Amazon executive Doug Gurr, a move that sparked a coalition of smaller tech firms and not-for-profits to pen an open letter expressing their concern at the CMA\u2019s new direction.\n\nToday\u2019s decision is in line with those changes. The U.K. wants the world to know it doesn\u2019t want to be a roadblock to business, which extends to deals of this nature involving companies headquartered elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe British government recently signaled that it wants the CMA to be more careful about intervening in international deals where there is no special U.K. issue,\u201d Tom Smith, partner at London-based law firm Geradin Partners and former legal director at the CMA, told TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not possible to know if the result in this case would have been different without that signal.\u201d\n\nThe transaction isn\u2019t over the line yet, though: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the U.S. is also looking at the deal, though it has yet to make a formal announcement at the time of writing.\n\nIBM declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch.",

In 2025, the new question is whether Cassandra can be the default database for a generation. To get there, the project needs a lot of friends, and it has some great ones. Netflix, Apple, Bloomberg, Uber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long list. Today, IBM joined the chorus. The Cassandra project momentum has been picking up and just got some big blue jet boots.\u201d\n\nDataStax CEO Chet Kapoor wrote: \u201cDataStax\u2019s NoSQL products\u2014our cloud service, Astra DB , and self-managed DataStax Enterprise \u2014have been the standard for scale-out data delivered on top of Cassandra.\n\n\u201cDataStax and IBM have collaborated in the market since 2020, serving customers such as T-Mobile, Audi, The Home Depot, and Intuit.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, DataStax introduced HCD and Mission Control, further bringing Cassandra into the cloud-native era, deployed on top of IBM OpenShift. We\u2019re excited to continue making Cassandra the standard for scaling out cloud-native data for our existing and future customers.\u201d\n\nThe deal follows DataStax\u2019s April 2024 acquisition of Langflow, which provides a GUI for building retrieval augmented generation and other AI applications with LangChain .

            "content": "The chip race in Silicon Valley has been underway since long before generative AI applications supercharged tech companies\u2019 appetite for them. In 2015, Google\u2019s AI system AlphaGo, powered by a Google-designed chip known as a tensor processing unit (TPU), beat a professional human player at the ancient Chinese game Go. Since then, Google has unveiled a series of chips it designed in-house to power AI systems in its data centers. Most recently, in December 2024, Google announced a new AI chip for quantum computing named Willow. The company says Willow can complete a standard benchmark computation in under 5 minutes\u2014one that would take one of today\u2019s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion, or 1025, years.\n\nAround the same time that Google was launching AlphaGo, researchers at IBM started investigating building AI hardware, too. By 2021, IBM had opened its AI Hardware Center in Albany, New York, to create a wider AI hardware-software ecosystem, and by 2022, IBM\u2019s new Telum microprocessor chip had brought AI inferencing to IBM Z, the mainframes that run roughly 70% of the world\u2019s transactions by value. In late 2024, IBM announced a new Spyre accelerator chip, which brought generative AI to IBM Z mainframes for enterprise users.\n\nMeanwhile, AWS has been working on its own computer chips for AI projects since at least 2018. Fast forward to the 2024 AWS annual event, where Amazon announced its latest custom Trainium3 AI chip, which it is bringing to customers paired with partner Anthropic\u2019s large language models. Many companies have snapped up AWS\u2019s AI chips, including Apple, which drew attention at AWS 2024 as it was a rare moment where Apple discussed one of its vendors.\n\nNot to be outdone, Microsoft, which has made chips to power its gaming functions for years, announced its own custom AI chips in 2023, around the same time tech giant Meta announced its own silicon chip plans. OpenAI is the latest to join the custom silicon party, though it hasn\u2019t made any official announcements yet. While no details have been shared publicly, Reuters reported earlier this month that OpenAI was finalizing its chip designs, with plans to start fabricating them via TSMC in 2025.\n\nWhy has the chip race intensified recently? IBM\u2019s Varshney says that when companies can customize chips to specific language models for the use cases they need, they can cut costs, improve latency or speed up the movement of data from one network to another. He points to an example: historically, when companies were doing fraud detection and examining incoming invoices, they used classical computing techniques because the volume was high, and they needed very quick latency. \u201cThey also had to do this a million times a day, so the cost would add up really quickly,\u201d Varshney says.\n\nNow that companies can optimize their chips for specific models, the cost of high-volume use cases goes down, and it becomes more cost-effective to use these solutions in production at scale. \u201cSo from an enterprise perspective, the use cases don't change,\u201d Varshney says. \u201cBut now we start to go after the high-volume ones where earlier the ROI didn't exist.\u201d",

            "content": "Semiconductors, just like the AI workloads they power, are exponentially evolving. Take Blackwell, Nvidia \u2019s highly anticipated next-generation GPU, which is marketed as being able to run AI models at 25 times lower costs than the previous Nvidia H100 series.\n\nBut advancements in technology are happening at such a rate that current semiconductors could become obsolete in 3-5 years, that\u2019s the view of Dr. Seth Dobrin, former IBM Chief AI Officer, and now founder and CEO of Qantm AI and General Partner at 1infinity Ventures.\n\nSubscribe today for free\n\nSpeaking at Metro Connect 2025 in Fort Lauderdale, Dobrin highlighted that several innovative startups are creating technologies not only set to rival semiconductor stalwarts like Nvidia, AMD , and Intel but also consign their current technology to the annals of history.\n\nDorbin highlighted emerging technologies ranging from photonics , which uses electrons to process and transmit data at far higher speeds, to plasmonics, which uses surface plasmons (oscillations of free electrons at the interface between materials) to manipulate and transmit data at nanoscales. These technologies are set to provide even greater miniaturisation and efficiency in powering both computing and communications.\n\nAnother potentially game-changing concept Dobrin discussed was neuromorphic chips, where a neural network is integrated directly into a semiconductor, effectively mimicking the potential cognitive action of the human brain.\n\nDobrin outlined that he was aware of a handful of startups that were headway with spiking neural network technologies, with their added benefit being that they don\u2019t require the two to three-nanometer fabs coveted by current hardware players that take considerable levels of intricacy to produce.\n\n\u201cThey can use fabs that everyone else is abandoning, so that's why I say three to five years, as they don't need to build new fabs. They can take over fabs that other people are abandoning,\u201d Dobrin said.\n\nThese concepts are still emerging at varying degrees. Photonics alone has already seen millions of dollars pumped into startups like Oriole Networks , Lightmatter , and Ephos as they work to develop next-gen chips that leverage light.\n\nOne startup Dobrin referenced on the neuromorphic side was Conscium, which is led by Daniel Hulme of Satalia-fame. The team there are attempting to create neuromorphic computing solutions using both hardware and software to simulate the brain's neural and synaptic structures.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just startups looking to shake things up. Just last week, Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum computing chip that leverages a new kind of architecture that could potentially unlock actual applications far sooner than the previously anticipated quantum timelines.\n\nDeepSeek considerations: New technologies bring advantages\n\nThe recent rise of DeepSeek and the subsequent stock sell-off put current hardware solutions into stark contrast.\n\nIn the wake of DeepSeek, Dobrin said data centre operators and investors need to monitor these new technologies as they ramp up to beat the curve and get ahead.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be an overnight change,\u201d Dobrin said. \u201cYou're going to have three or four emerging technologies accelerating this shift. Instead of one new technology gradually replacing the old, these advancements\u2014like photonics, plasmonics, and neuromorphic hardware\u2014will all develop at a similar pace, making the decline of current semiconductors happen much faster.\u201d\n\nFollowing the \u201ctwo-week panic\u201d brought on by DeepSeek, Dobrin said the general view was that demand for data centres and related hardware will still stay, owing to more of a temporary blip rather than a major disruption.\n\nHe added that the resulting concern about the Chinese startup purportedly copying technology from OpenAI was more akin to fair use \u2014 arguing that it's no different than what companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have done in terms of using publicly available data.\n\n\u201cWeeks before DeepSeek released their model, some graduate students at Berkeley built Sky-T1, but no one complained about that because it wasn't in Beijing. Everyone thought it was great, and while it wasn\u2019t quite as good as DeepSeek, fair use is fair use.\u201d\n\nAlready the overreliance on GPUs is being challenged by a hardware landscape that\u2019s slowly becoming more diverse, with operators increasingly turning to other solutions like CPUs to power their workloads.\n\nCPUs like AMD\u2019s EPYC series are helping to power AI workloads in data centres. Dobrin highlighted databiome, which is developing small-scale language models, as an example of a firm actively running AI training and inference on CPUs.\n\n\u201c[Data Biome] work with telcos and gaming companies, replacing large language models and GPUs, which helps businesses save millions of dollars each month by reducing GPU usage. It has a huge impact on GPU capacity. They're also partnering with AMD and Intel.\u201d\n\nDobrin said the divergence away from GPUs, along with the rise of emerging hardware solutions will ultimately help prevent operators from being solely reliant on Nvidia's ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAMD recently launched a great GPU, and there are GPU virtualisation platforms like Mako, which allow you to virtualise across any GPU using any language,\u201d Dobrin said. \u201cThis creates an abstraction layer, so you're no longer locked into Nvidia's CUDA \u2014 you can run CUDA on AMD, Intel, or any other GPU. All of these developments are breaking Nvidia's previous lock-in.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nDigitalBridge CEO on the AI revolution\u2019s impact on investments",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other best performing Dow stocks so far in 2025.\n\nThe Dow is a renowned and significant stock market index that measures the performance of 30 publicly traded businesses listed on US stock exchanges, representing a diverse variety of industries.\n\nAs of 20 February 2025, the index has steadily increased, rising 14.41% in the last 12 months and 4.21% year to date in 2025. It rose 8.04% over the last six months, mirroring its 8.04% gain in the previous month. Over the long term, it has risen 52.37% in the last five years and has returned an astounding 3,362.55% since 1985.\n\nIn comparison, the broader market has outpaced the Dow, gaining 22% in the last year and 4% year to date in 2025. The wider market has risen 8.84% during the last six months, with a 1.13% increase in the last month. Its long-term performance has been favorable, with a five-year gain of 83.28% and a remarkable 3,717.09% increase since 1996. Its superior performance is largely due to the strength of technology and high-growth stocks.\n\nNonetheless, the Nasdaq has led the market, climbing 28.12% in the last 12 months and 3.53% year to date in 2025. Over the last six months, the Nasdaq has gone up by 11.40%, with 1.04% growth in the last month. Over the last five years, it has surged by 108.45%, proving its dominance in high-growth sectors.\n\nWhile the Dow has fallen behind the other two markets in recent years, its consistency and solid historical returns underline its long-term investment appeal. The index typically has reduced volatility and concentrates on established blue-chip companies.\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dow is still a dependable benchmark for US market performance, following 30 blue-chip businesses with strong reputations and consistent growth. Its price-weighted system ensures stability, typically reducing losses during downturns. The index has a historical association with broader markets, but it is less volatile than the broader market due to its emphasis on well-established firms. Despite its small size, the index has shown resilience in bear markets, such as 2009, while also reaping gains during bullish cycles. Its longstanding reputation and exposure to important industries make it a reliable predictor of economic strength.\n\nHowever, the Dow lost 0.6% on Thursday, February 20, 2025, as U.S. jobless claims surged faster than expected, heightening concerns about the labor market and the overall economic outlook. The wider market fell 0.5%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.7% in early trading, signaling broader market weakness. Investors reacted to economic data and shifting market sentiment as bond yields edged lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.52%.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified stocks that have delivered positive returns in 2025 so far. We then picked the top 11 stocks with the highest Year-to-Date return as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\n\n\u201cWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\u201d\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nYear-to-date return as of February 14: 18.80%\n\nOne of the biggest providers of IT services globally, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) continues to dominate the mainframe market and has established software and consulting units specializing in hybrid cloud infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives. Over the past few decades, the firm has had to reinvent itself in response to a shifting industry landscape that affected its initial mainframe business. The business has positioned itself to meet the demands of companies looking for hardware, consulting services, and updates for their IT infrastructure. Along with consulting services for project implementation and maintenance, the company\u2019s software products are being utilized in hybrid cloud-focused initiatives. IBM-assisted hardware can also be used for these projects.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stated that there was a high demand for new artificial intelligence projects in its fourth-quarter financial results, which exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. As a result, the stock price was up over 18% so far this year, making it the Best Performing Stock.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported $17.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, a 1% increase YoY. Strong demand for Red Hat drove double-digit revenue growth in the software area. Its generative AI segment has over $5 billion in total sales, up over $2 billion from the previous quarter, highlighting that businesses worldwide are looking to the company for AI-powered transformation. In 2024, it generated $12.7 billion in free cash flow and $13.4 billion in operating cash flow, displaying a high cash performance.\n\nOppenheimer believes that the company\u2019s move toward a greater emphasis on software has not yet been completely acknowledged by investors. The investment firm gave the IT behemoth an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating when it first started covering it. The price estimate of $320 per share was established by analyst Param Singh, suggesting a possible upside of over 28%. As the market learns more about International Business Machines Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:IBM) strategy shift to software, Singh also anticipates that the company\u2019s worth will rise over time.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 1st on our list of Best Performing Dow Stocks So Far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Development of Phase Superconductor Quantum Chip Increase the qubit stably and accelerate commercialization. Academia \"There is no computational process in the paper. You have to wait carefully\".\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 Yang Jab, developed by MS. [Photo = MS]\n\nNews came out on the 19th (local time) that Microsoft (MS) has developed a new \"quantum chip\" that has never existed before. It is said to be a step closer to implementing quantum computers, and let's look at what MS technology is and how it differs from companies that are developing quantum computers such as Google and IBM.\n\nSuperconductors, ion traps, topological superconductors...\n\nFirst, let's briefly summarize quantum computers. Traditional computers use the bits '0' and '1' as basic units. Quantum computers use a unit called 'qubit' that has two states at the same time along with '0' and '1'. This is based on quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is an equation that explains the motion of small particles invisible to our eyes. The F (force) = m (mass) and a (acceleration) presented by Newton explains the movement of objects in our eyes.\n\nHowever, the movement of small particles such as molecules, atoms, and electrons cannot be explained by Newton's equations. Everything is explained by quantum mechanics based on uncertainty. In quantum mechanics, two states coexist (overlapping) and are entangled (entangled). Using this phenomenon, you can create new computers that have significantly faster computational speeds than traditional computers.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to create a state called qubit. Scientists use three main methods to implement this. The first is the superconductor method. A superconductor refers to an object with '0' electrical resistance, and if a thin insulating layer is placed between these superconductors, the quantum state is realized and the qubit can be adjusted. This method has been studied considerably, and is also known to be quite fast in computation. Google and IBM are using this method to develop quantum computers.\n\nThe second is the ion trap method. We use an electric field to float the ions in the air, and then we shoot the laser here. Then, the kinetic energy of the ions decreases and cools. In this process, a qubit is formed using a specific energy level of the ion. This method has high computational accuracy but is difficult to increase the number of qubits. IonQ is developing a quantum computer based on this.\n\nMS Develops Technology to Stable Expansion of Qubit\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 IBM Quantum Computer [Photo = IBM]\n\nFinally, it's a phase superconductor. It's a little bit like a superconductor. Superconductors with unique structures create something called 'Mayorana quasiparticles'. The qubits created here are known to be less affected by the external environment and thus have low error rates. If this is implemented, the quantum computer qubit can be increased quickly, but it has not been implemented yet. MS says in its recently published paper that it has succeeded in implementing qubits in the topological superconductor method. In other words, we have confirmed the possibility of creating quantum computers based on technology that no one has ever done. Microsoft claims that this technology can make qubits stable, which can speed up the commercialization of quantum computers.\n\nFor instance, if the superconductor method is like skating on ice, then a topological superconductor is similar to a roller coaster track. Skates can easily trip over if the ice is rough or impurities are present. On the other hand, roller coasters are difficult to make, but as they move along a pre-designed path, they can be operated whether it rains or snows.\n\nHowever, scholars in the quantum field interviewed by foreign media such as Nature and the Guardian expressed cautious opinions. Scientists working on quantum computers in Korea were similar. In an interview with the New York Times, Professor Jason Alicia Caltech said, \"Phase qubits are possible in principle. However, it is necessary to verify that the device operates in all the magical ways that are theoretically expected. Otherwise, the reality of quantum computers may not be as rosy as expected. Fortunately, Microsoft has the environment to verify this.\" The experts interviewed by Nature have similar opinions. It is followed by points such as \"There is not much to comment on without additional data on the operation of the qubit.\"\n\nAcademia, \"There are still many things to overcome.\"\n\nMS also has similar bad experiences in the past. In 2018, a team of researchers led by MS published a paper in the journal Nature stating that they succeeded in making Mayorana particles. At the time, Microsoft once said, \"We will develop a commercially available quantum computer that solves real problems within five years,\" but in 2021, three years later, an error in the paper was found and withdrawn.\n\nScientists tend to view their findings as conservative. Companies want to know this within the 'facts'. Many experts agree that MS researchers' achievements are significant in terms of 'science'. If this technology develops rapidly, it is natural that the commercialization of quantum computers will accelerate. In this process, scientists are saying, \"Get a clearer basis.\"\n\nI think it would be good for criminals like us to look at the technology between these two perspectives. No new technology is completed in a day.",

            "content": "The United Naga Council (UNC) in Manipur has voiced strong opposition to the abrupt termination of the Free Movement Regime (FMR) and the construction of a border fence along the Indo-Myanmar Border (IBM).\n\nThe Naga people have shared familial and communal bonds across the border since time immemorial, predating colonial demarcations.\n\nHowever, the imposition of a physical barrier is seen as a direct threat to this interdependence.\n\nReports indicate that many families own ancestral lands on both sides of the border and are now being denied access to them due to the fencing project.\n\nBeyond human concerns, the ecological impact of the fencing is also a pressing issue.\n\nExperts warn that the construction could significantly disrupt the movement of wildlife, fragment populations, and reduce genetic diversity among species.\n\nThe fencing risks affecting biodiversity hotspots and disturbing the delicate ecological balance, thereby threatening the survival of numerous flora and fauna.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Manipur: 6 active cadres of Kangleipak Communist Party arrested, explosives recovered in Kakching area\n\nThe government has justified its decision by citing the need to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.\n\nHowever, local stakeholders, including the UNC, argue that such justifications lack historical or factual backing.\n\nAccording to them, there is no evidence of significant drug smuggling or illegal immigration in Naga-inhabited regions along the Indo-Myanmar border.\n\nInstead of blanket measures like border fencing, they suggest implementing stringent laws such as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to address these concerns.\n\nThe move has led to growing dissatisfaction among frontier communities, who feel their voices are being ignored. Many see the scrapping of FMR and the erection of barriers as an act of political insensitivity that exacerbates old wounds rather than resolving long-standing issues.\n\nCommunity leaders emphasize that their opposition is not an anti-India stance but a plea for recognizing historical and traditional boundaries. They urge the Government of India to engage in meaningful dialogue rather than imposing policies from a distance without considering the ground realities.\n\nInstead of reducing the FMR coverage, they propose its reinstatement and even expansion from 16 km to 40 km to better facilitate local trade, healthcare access, and cross-border familial interactions.\n\nAdditionally, they call for engaging local communities in decision-making processes regarding border management, which could foster cooperation and minimize disruptions.\n\nIf fencing the Indo-Myanmar border remains a priority, they argue that proper demarcation based on historical boundaries must precede any physical construction to prevent unintended consequences and social unrest.\n\nAmid these border-related concerns, tripartite talks between the Government of Manipur, the Government of India, and the UNC are ongoing. The discussions, led by AK Mishra, Advisor for Northeast Affairs, focus on the rollback of seven districts created on December 8, 2016. The UNC has appealed for a swift resolution, urging the intervention of the Governor to settle the matter amicably.\n\nRegarding the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur, the UNC reaffirmed its commitment to peace and stability between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. However, they stress that without decisive intervention from competent authorities, long-term solutions remain elusive.\n\nThe council has expressed hope that the new administration under the Governor\u2019s leadership will bring peace and normalcy to the state.",

The rise of generative AI and big data has brought data governance and all its requirements to the forefront of the modern enterprise.\n\nGenerative AI, with its capacity to create new content based on data upon which it has trained, creates new demands in the safe and lawful collection, storage and processing of data.\n\nQuality\n\nBecause generative AI models are trained on massive datasets, the data within those sets must be of the highest quality, and its integrity must be unquestionable. Data governance plays an important role in helping ensure that the datasets generative AI models train on are accurate and complete, a key component in generating answers that can be relied upon.\n\nCompliance\n\nDepending on industry and location, generative AI business applications face a rigorous compliance environment in how data can be used. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules, for example, govern how data belonging to EU residents can be used by organizations. Violations carry heavy fines and penalties when customer information is compromised in any way.\n\nIn 2021, Google and other companies were fined over a billion dollars for violating data protection rules stipulated in the GDPR.\n\nTransparency\n\nFor a generative AI application to be effective, the origin of its data and how the data has been transformed for business use must be clearly established and visible. Data governance helps ensure that documentation exists\u2014and is transparent to users\u2014at every step of the data lifecycle, from collection, through storage, processing and output, so users understand how an answer was generated.",

Nguyen, IBM Research; (4) Pankaj Dayama, IBM Research; (5) Chandra Reddy, IBM Research; (6) Wesley M. Gifford, IBM Research; (7) Jayant Kalagnanam, IBM Research.\n\nEditor's note: this is part 3 of 5 of a study detailing the development of a tiny, fast AI model that delivers excellent accuracy. Read the rest below.\n\n3 TTM Workflows\n\nTTM works in 2 stages: pre-train and fine-tune (Figure 1(a)).\n\n3.1 Pre-training Workflow\n\nMulti-Resolution Pre-training via TTM Backbone\n\nThe majority of the pre-training happens in the TTM backbone. The primary challenge with the proposed pre-training technique is that the pre-training data is diverse and has multiple resolutions. There are two main options for pre-training: conducting separate pre-training for each resolution type or pre-training using all resolution data collectively. While it\u2019s common to train a model per resolution type to overcome challenges in learning diverse seasonal patterns, this leads to diminished training data for each resolution due to limited data availability. Consequently, this motivated the exploration of pre-training a single model using datasets from all resolutions. To achieve this, we propose the following 3 enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Augmentation via Downsampling: A significant challenge in TS pre-training datasets is the scarcity of public datasets at specific resolutions. To overcome this, we employ a downsampling technique for high-resolution datasets, generating multiple datasets at lower resolutions. For example, from a one-second resolution dataset, we derive datasets at minute and hour resolutions. Note that, the original high-resolution dataset remains within the pool of pre-training datasets. This methodology significantly augments the number of datasets for each resolution which greatly improves the model performance (Section 4.5).\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Prefix Tuning: This technique explicitly learns and incorporates a new patch embedding as a prefix into the input data based on the input resolution type (see Figure 1(b)). Similar to the concept of prefix tuning [Li and Liang, 2021], this approach provides an explicit signal to the model about the resolution type for resolution-conditioned modeling. First, we map every resolution to a unique integer, which is then passed through an embedding layer to project it to the hidden dimension, hf. Subsequently, we expand the embedding across all channels to have a representation of shape c\u00d71\u00d7hf. This module is optional for the TTM backbone, particularly beneficial when the context length (sl) is short. In these scenarios, automatically detecting the resolution becomes a challenge for the model. Hence, by explicitly fusing the resolution information as a prefix, we can enhance the model\u2019s ability to learn effectively across resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Fine-tuning Workflow\n\nIn the fine-tuning workflow, we deal with data from the target domain that has no overlap with the pre-training datasets. We have three options here: (a) In Zero-shot forecasting, we directly use the pre-trained model to evaluate on the test part of the target data, (b) In Few-shot forecasting, we utilize only a tiny portion (5-10%) of the train part of the target data to quickly update the pre-trained weights of the decoder and head, and subsequently, evaluate it on the test part, (c) In Full-shot forecasting, we fine-tune the pre-trained weights of the decoder and head on the entire train part of the target data, and then, evaluate on the test part.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe backbone is completely frozen during fine-tuning, and still operates in a channel-independent univariate fashion. However, the TTM decoder can be fine-tuned via channel-mixing (for multivariate) or a channel-independent (for univariate) way based on the nature of the target data. If pure multivariate modeling is needed, then the channel-mixer block in all the TSMixer components (see Figure 1(b)) in the decoder gets enabled to explicitly capture the channel correlation between the channels. The forecast head and reverse normalization perform similar operations as in the pretraining stage. The fine-tuning also optimizes the forecasting objective with MSE loss. This thoughtful multi-level design choice ensures our backbone excels in channel-independent pre-training, enabling effective temporal correlation modeling across diverse datasets. Simultaneously, the decoder handles target-data-specific tasks like channel-correlation modeling and fine-tuning. In addition, if the target data has exogenous variables, then an exogenous mixer block is applied to the actual forecasts as explained next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "IBM is looking to reduce expenses through what's described as a co-location program that, according to current and former employees who spoke with The Register, appears to be designed to drive out older, more expensive workers.\n\nThe mainframe giant's recent return-to-office (RTO) push is already arguably achieving that, namely forcing out those kinds of workers, but we're told that Big Blue is taking a broader approach, echoing a 2016 initiative from then marketing chief Michelle Peluso.\n\nAs we reported at the time, marketing staff in the US were directed to work from one of six strategic locations in the country. That required marketing workers to relocate, with a modest moving allowance and no guaranteed salary adjustment for cost of living changes, or to leave the company.\n\nThat program was extended to IBM's Software and Systems unit in 2017.\n\nIBM, like Amazon, Dell, and other tech firms, wants employees allowed to work remotely during the COVID pandemic to resume working from a corporate office \u2013 ostensibly for better communication and team cohesion.\n\nIn 2024, IBM Consulting instructed executives and people managers to work from a corporate office at least three days per week. IBM Software issued similar orders to employees several months earlier. Earlier this month, Finance & Operations employees faced an RTO demand.\n\nBut IBM's co-location program affects workers who have never worked from corporate offices.\n\nThis program is intended to get people not only back in the office but bring teams with common work functions together into the same location\n\n\"IBM is implementing a 'co-location' program,\" an IBM employee told us. \"This program is intended to get people not only back in the office but bring teams with common work functions together into the same location.\n\n\"In 2024, IBM mandated all US managers back into the office. This was the start of co-location. Now, rolling out in phases, all US employees will be required to co-located or resign from IBM.\"\n\nIn America, we hear, IBM presently has eight strategic locations where employees are expected to work: Two in New York, two in Illinois, two in Texas, and two in North Carolina. In New York City, IBM recently opened a new flagship office, which we're told IBM expects to be occupied by employees.\n\nThere are plausible benefits for working from an office, but there are also many studies that highlight the advantages of supporting remote work and the detrimental effects of RTO directives.\n\n\"IBM has recently mandated that all employees co-locate in strategic locations or resign,\" our source explained. \"This included all employees who started working from home during COVID as well as those who have been working from home for 15-plus years.\"\n\nIBM has recently mandated that all employees co-locate in strategic locations or resign\n\nMany of the employees who have given more than a decade to the IT titan have established lives in communities where they've participated in civic and religious life, and perhaps have raised children. They're often of middle-age, with families that strong social ties, within two or three years of retirement eligibility.\n\nOur sources suggest that co-location amounts to age discrimination because older, more established workers are less willing to pick up stakes and move.\n\n\"For years, IBM has been hiring only into strategic locations, which implies they are selectively targeting those who are established in their home offices and have been for 20-plus years,\" we're told.\n\nA former IBM employee we spoke to, recently laid off, agreed with the current employee's interpretation of events about how co-location will affect older workers.\n\n\"The company is not going to pay to relocate anybody,\" the former employee said. \"And you know, it's a way to get rid of a bunch of people and a bunch of older people.\"\n\nWithin IBM, as the corporation acknowledges on its website, employees have long joked that its initials stand for \"I've Been Moved.\" But as we hear it, that came about at a time when IBM paid for relocations.\n\nIBM, despite being subject to numerous age discrimination lawsuits in recent years, maintains that it does not systematically discriminate, on the basis of age or anything else.\n\nIn unofficial IBM discussion forums like Reddit, those posting about co-location share the view voiced by our sources about the impact of the co-location program. For example, one individual claiming to have been with IBM's software group for more than 20 years alleges being asked to relocate when fellow team members were not.\n\nAnother forum participant replied, \"It's a stealth layoff. Same thing happened to me \u2013 I was asked to move to a strategic site to better 'collaborate,' but no other members of my team were even at this new location.\"\n\nIn a more recent thread, a forum poster says, \"Just keep in mind, the object of co-location is to get you to quit. It is statistically known that the majority of people will not move, and decide to leave. This is what they are hoping from you.\"\n\nThe Register asked IBM to explain why it's pursuing its co-location plan and we've not heard back.\n\nCo-location is one aspect of a broader workforce rebalancing strategy, which appears to be an ongoing activity at IBM. \"[CEO] Arvind [Krishna] said in an employee broadcast in March 2024 that 'skills rebalancing will be perpetual, and the average shelf life of skills now is three to seven years; where it used to be 20-plus years,'\" our source said.\n\nCFO Jim Kavanaugh, our source said, has repeatedly talked about getting IBM's stock price to $300 per share; it currently stands at $264. \"I think this is just cutting expenses,\" our source speculated, adding that colleagues have said the move-or-leave demands imperil stock option vesting. \"A couple of my peers are trying to hang on to get their vested stock options,\" we're told.\n\nThe implication is that the decision deadline means those who refuse to move and have to leave the company may miss out on stock grants pegged to a future date, a financial loss to them but a gain for IBM.\n\nAs to why this is happening now, our source within IBM described a conversation between an employee and manager in which the manager described an executive-level debate about whether to do a layoff, known internally as a resource action, or a co-location program.\n\n\"A resource action would target employees whose job has been eliminated or employees who do not meet performance requirements,\" our source said. \"Co-location would target a much broader group of work-from-home or remote employees. Most of those who are long-time loyal employees who have established ties in their communities. The company chose to roll out the co-location program.\"\n\nThis executive, it's claimed, subsequently said there would be no resource actions in 2025, \"presumably because [IBM] will hit the attrition target with co-location.\" \u00ae",

This can be key to surpass incremental productivity gains to achieve real performance and value, yet there are still some major hurdles in the way.\n\nMany early AI experiments focused on simple productivity tasks or bolting AI onto outdated business processes, which yield only marginal improvements. Often organizations are working with data that is fragmented, poor quality or outdated. Most organizations have legacy IT systems with disparate applications and complex integrations, which makes it harder to pull data from where it\u2019s needed to support new AI-powered processes. Lastly, there\u2019s a need for broad workforce re-skilling so employees understand and can apply AI in their daily work.\n\nIn the face of all those obstacles, AI agents alone are not enough. We believe enterprises need to take a comprehensive approach to re-engineering entire business processes, dramatically changing both user experience and the orchestrated system of AI assistants, agents and data that supports it.\n\nWe like to call this reimagined business process an \u201cagentic app.\u201d It has three layers:\n\nPersona-based user experience : enhance the everyday tools of employees with a new user experience, integrating AI assistants tailored to specific user personas\n\n: enhance the everyday tools of employees with a new user experience, integrating AI assistants tailored to specific user personas Multi-agent orchestration : an orchestration layer powered by multiple AI agents that work together to transform how workflows are executed, monitored, and controlled, incorporating robust AI governance\n\n: an orchestration layer powered by multiple AI agents that work together to transform how workflows are executed, monitored, and controlled, incorporating robust AI governance Optimized data management: data products that enable data that is organized, prepped for consumption, and readily available in real-time from distributed enterprise systems\n\nTo enable and support agentic apps, leaders also need to up-skill their teams and execute change management programs to encourage employee adoption, establish rigorous organizational governance and more.\n\nIntroducing AI Integration Services\n\nIBM Consulting\u2019s new AI Integration Services bring together key capabilities plus IBM\u2019s open ecosystem of partners to help clients transform end-to-end business processes into agentic apps and help drive ROI from AI. There are three key components:\n\nDeep expertise in scaling AI: Our consultants have deep technology, business domain and industry expertise, built upon experience helping clients scale AI with appropriate governance guardrails as well as building and implementing agentic solutions to transform business operations. More than 75,000 IBM consultants have earned generative AI certifications in IBM and strategic partner technology since 2023, and we\u2019ve earned 135,000 industry credentials in sectors like banking and financial services, telecommunications, public sector and more.\n\nGenerative AI-powered technology solutions: We are also bringing capabilities in IBM Consulting Advantage, our first-of-its-kind AI-powered delivery platform that is designed to supercharge our consulting expertise. The new IBM Consulting Agents Catalyst technology solution enables IBM consultants and clients with a low code/no-code approach to design, build and deploy agentic apps to transform complex enterprise workflows on their preferred cloud platform. Using the foundational capabilities of IBM Consulting Advantage with this new solution, IBM consultants can accelerate the development of agentic apps using technology from IBM, Microsoft and AWS.\n\nLibrary of pre-built Agentic Apps templates: A suite of pre-built templates for specific business domain and industry processes. The templates combine persona-based user experiences with AI assistants; a range of custom AI agents or pre-built agents from IBM and strategic partners like Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow that automate workflows; and are underpinned by operational and analytical data.

This includes but is not limited to routine duties like equipment upkeep, space planning, and investment portfolio projections. Organizations can benefit from facilities management services by contracting with an outside company to take care of day-to-day operations and maintenance at their buildings as well as other, less crucial tasks. The FM provider's offerings included hard services, business support services, and energy management services. Modernizing office premises and expanding cities have raised the need for FM services. In addition, customer companies are improving their operations by reducing their infrastructure and procedures. The increasing efficiency of business processes is dependent on the facilities' ability to work as expected. FM service providers have their jobs cut out for them in energy management. However, the poor retention of skilled manpower is a limitation on the worldwide Facility Management Services Market's growth, making it one of the most difficult markets to maintain a stable workforce.List of Prominent Players in the facility management market:\u2022 IBM Corporation (US)\u2022 Oracle Corporation (US)\u2022 SAP SE (Germany)\u2022 CBRE Group, Inc.

The majority of work done and new business generated in this sector is associated with enhancing preexisting structures. Governments in these countries are therefore recruiting private organizations, including service providers and a number of foreign companies, to assist in the upkeep of a green and clean infrastructure.Expert Knowledge, Just a Click Away:Challenges:The prime challenge is insufficient technological knowledge, a shortage of competent individuals and a lack of norms and protocol because the lack of technical ability to run and maintain these solutions discourages their adoption, limiting the number of users of facility management solutions. Facility management is viewed as something other than a legitimate occupation by most companies. As a result, there needs to be more skilled workers to implement facility management strategies. Large firms sometimes need more management and executive-level technological expertise to implement sophisticated facilities management solutions. Experts are working on a solution, but training enough people to run the facilities management solutions will take years. The acceptance and expansion of the worldwide facility management market are expected to be deterred by worries about the availability of technical talent.Regional Trends:The North American facility management market is anticipated to record a major market share in revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future because of the growing research and development activities of both small and major companies. Businesses in North America are thriving because their leaders are adopting integrated enterprise and business solutions, which allow for more adaptability and speed in daily operations. Besides, Europe had a considerable share in the market due to proactive actions taken by governments in several countries in the region. Service providers can boost their workforce, output, and revenue by implementing these safety procedures.Recent Developments:\u2022 In May 2023, SAP and Planon jointly declared an extensive collaboration pertaining to the software market for facilities management. The partnership facilitated a more comprehensive integration of processes and technology by combining Planon's superior real estate and smart building management solution with SAP's market-leading ERP capabilities.\u2022 In Jan 2020, IBM integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into its TRIRIGA solution to enhance the efficiency of real estate and facility management professionals in optimizing office space and providing a more immersive workplace environment.

            "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just shook up the quantum computing race with its Majorana 1 chipa breakthrough that could slash the timeline for useful quantum machines from decades to just years. Unlike traditional quantum chips that struggle with instability, Microsoft's new design taps into Majorana fermions, an elusive subatomic particle first theorized in the 1930s but never before controlled at scale. The company says this innovation makes its qubits far less prone to errors, potentially giving it a major edge over rivals like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). The chip is designed to integrate seamlessly into Microsoft's Azure data centers, hinting at a strategy that prioritizes real-world deployment over theoretical milestones.\n\nThis announcement comes as the battle for quantum supremacy heats up. Quantum computers promise to crack problems that today's most powerful supercomputers would need millions of years to solve, revolutionizing fields like medicine, materials science, and AI. But the industry remains divided on just how soon this future will arrive. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently cast doubt on near-term quantum breakthroughs, suggesting the tech is still 20 years away from overtaking traditional chips. Meanwhile, Google says commercial quantum applications could be viable in just five years, and IBM has set a 2033 target for large-scale adoption. Microsoft's approach is differentit's betting that fewer, more stable qubits will bring practical quantum computing faster than anyone expects.\n\nFor investors, this is a high-risk, high-reward play that could reshape the entire computing landscape. If Microsoft's bet pays off, it won't just disrupt classical computingit could also challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI chips. However, the timeline remains murky, and Microsoft hasn't set a firm date for when Majorana 1 will scale beyond prototypes. The stakes are massive, and with Google and IBM also racing to commercialize quantum technology, the next few years could determine who takes the lead in a trillion-dollar marketor whether quantum computing remains just out of reach.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "People, perseverance, and partnership\n\nIBM Consulting and CA-MMIS: A successful partnership\n\nAbout The California Department of Health Care Services\n\nLegacy platforms no longer support Business needs and are cost prohibitive. Effective healthcare systems are essential for individual and societal well-being.However, large and complex systems sometimes struggle to keep pace as healthcare needs evolve.As healthcare demands increase and patient expectations rise, it\u2019s important to modernize these systems to deliver efficient, accessible, and high-quality care. This was the challenge faced by the State of California.The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) operates the California Medicaid Management Information System (CA-MMIS), a complex system serving California\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries, known as Medi-Cal. CA-MMIS processes about 200 million claims annually for almost 15 million beneficiaries, the largest Medicaid population in the nation. However, the decades-old CA-MMIS application, critical to the smooth functioning of the system, was hindering progress.DHCS partnered with IBM Consulting\u00ae , and that initial step led both partners to embark on what became a transformative journey.When IBM Consulting entered the scene in 2009-2010, they had to navigate a complex and uncertain landscape. Despite the initial challenges and previous vendor's shortcomings, IBM Consulting demonstrated a strong commitment to innovation throughout the project. The team navigated the technological and cultural constraints of the State of California, carefully considering the client's existing infrastructure and operational norms. By clearly articulating the potential for transformative change and consistently moving together towards a shared vision, IBM successfully expanded the State of California\u2019s initial understanding of what was possible and helped make it a reality. Their commitment to the project and perseverance in understanding the client laid the groundwork for a significant breakthrough: a contract awarded by the State of California in 2018-2019. This marked a pivotal moment, empowering IBM to take the reins in managing the entire CA-MMIS suite of applications.With direct client access, IBM Consulting determined that the path to transformation had to start by addressing public-facing services and security approaches to technology upgrades for their system. The consulting team first established credibility by showcasing their expertise and understanding of IBM's capabilities. Next, they spent months in understanding the aspirations, desired goals and objectives of the client\u2014not just the organization, and technology but the people representing the client. By mapping the client organization\u2019s needs, IBM Consulting developed an overall approach that identified hidden pain points and opportunities, but would still be acceptable and preferred by the client organization. This empathetic approach fostered a sense of shared purpose and aligned IBM Consulting\u2019s efforts with the client's strategic goals.To bring their vision to life, the IBM Consulting team harnessed their expertise and resources, placing the client at the heart of their approach. By employing IBM Garage\u2122 design thinking methodologies and an agile mindset, they emphasized that their offering went beyond technology and were intended to better serve the people of California. They demonstrated a deep understanding of the client's people, their unique ways of thinking, and their motivations\u2014specifically, how to shift the mindset of CA-MMIS administrators from \"process managers\" to \"product owners\" who drive innovation beyond mere technology improvement. This human-centered approach, coupled with IBM Consulting's proven track record of successful Medicaid IT projects, fostered a collaborative and trusting environment. This collaborative spirit, built on mutual respect and open communication, enabled the IBM Consulting team to effectively address the division's concerns, navigate the complexities of the project, and ensure the final solution truly addressed the client's specific requirements and aspirations, including the critical need to improve provider satisfaction and streamline administrative processes.The successful collaboration between IBM Consulting and the client resulted in the approval of a proof of concept (POC) to develop a cloud-based portal for CA-MMIS. The success of the POC built confidence in cloud technology, proving that the collaborative method between DHCS and IBM of co-creating an IT system was possible and beneficial for all. The IBM and DHCS teams ensured that the portal was user-centric and efficient. Further, the DHCS and IBM teams challenged status quo ways of doing business so that inefficient business processes do not carry over into modern technology solutions. Examples include transition from paper-based business processes to fully electronic and business processes with little to no value were decommissioned. Business processes that previously took weeks and months, with considerable human effort now takes minutes with minimal or zero human-interaction. Robust security measures were implemented to meet HIPAA compliance standards. The portal demonstrated the benefits of cloud technology, such as faster time-to-market and efficient deployment, and also showed that IBM could deliver innovative and transformative work, which inspired the client to consider migrating its entire CA-MMIS application suite to the cloud.Some of the achievements with CA-MMIS hybrid cloud journey:96.7% Medi-Cal user volume on cloud60% daily business transaction volume on cloud76% legacy EOS/EOL applications migrated to cloud30% delivery cost reduction from inception of cloud journey5 new programs leveraging hybrid cloud2+ average features deployed per weekOver 3,100 organizations adopted paperless processesNumerous Business processes redesign and enforced through automated workflowsIBM Consulting also recognized the potential of cloud technology to improve operations and efficiency. That\u2019s why the development, maintenance, operations and infrastructure teams worked with the client team to develop a roadmap for migrating to a more secure, multi-tenant IBM Z\u00ae Cloud. Using RedHat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae on AWS (ROSA) , the team that started with a proof of concept sparked a broader transformation. This resulted in the migration of more than 30 functions from legacy systems to AWS cloud platform with the remaining functional apps in the pipeline for migration.The features developed for the provider portal, such as single sign-on and shared cost applications, have been successfully deployed and made available to all active provider organizations. The initiative has onboarded over 30,000 providers and helped the provider and submitter communities with faster service turnaround time, for example resetting PINs in real time instead of taking 30 days. The initiative also delivered new capabilities for CA-MMIS organization user management, electronic migration of paper records and scalable frameworks, all on a high availability and performant system.The successful partnership between IBM Consulting and the client has not only transformed the customized CA-MMIS legacy system and enhanced it with the latest technology and framework, but also set a new standard for innovation and collaboration in the industry. By embracing AWS cloud technology and a user-centric approach, the project has delivered significant value and paved the way for future digital transformation initiatives within the CA-MMIS program.By modernizing the CA-MMIS system and improving the provider portal, this project directly impacts the lives of Californians. Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right for all, and the Medi-Cal program plays a vital role in ensuring that millions of low-income and vulnerable individuals receive the care they need. Streamlined claims processing and reduced administrative burdens for providers lead to faster and more efficient access to care. Furthermore, enhanced data security and privacy protect the sensitive information of Medi-Cal beneficiaries, while improved communication and collaboration between providers and the state facilitate better coordination of care and ultimately promote improved health outcomes for beneficiaries. The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) (link resides outside of ibm.com) is the state's primary healthcare agency, serving over 14 million Californians through Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. DHCS is committed to providing equitable access to quality healthcare for all Californians by focusing on whole-person care, expanding access, improving health outcomes, and strengthening its workforce. Through initiatives like CalAIM and ongoing program enhancements, DHCS strives to improve the health and well-being of all Californians while ensuring the efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars.",

The challenge of implementing AI has rapidly moved from problems with the algorithms to issues with the data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finding and selecting the data needed to build an application that uses AI to make accurate predictions, governing sensitive data so an app can use AI to only provide the data that is appropriate for a given user and purpose, and ensuring data is fresh and accurate, so that the AI applications give customers correct information using the latest-breaking changes. Those who look to best support their AI innovation by leveraging solutions that treat data challenges will come out on top. In addition, we believe that moving AI projects from lab to production, will require process redesign capabilities and change management skills.\n\nDell Technologies CEO: Michael Dell Dell Tenure: 41 Years Has Been Dell CEO For: 41 Years In 2025, businesses will continue to grapple with AI adoption, surging data volumes and an evolving workforce. Customers need solutions that remove complexity so they can focus on their core mission. This is where collaboration with our trusted partner ecosystem will play a central role. By combining innovative technology with partners\u2019 expertise, we will simplify adoption and offer flexible, scalable and secure solutions to address critical business needs.\n\nIBM CEO: Arvind Krishna IBM Tenure: 34 Years Has Been IBM CEO For: 5 Years For customers, demonstrating significant ROI from AI will be essential to building the institutional confidence to scale the technology across their business. As they scale, they can both improve productivity and begin to create new business models, new revenue streams, and drive enduring growth. The alignment between business strategy and technology strategy is a key priority \u2014 deciding what they want to do and then focusing tightly on the right use cases. With the correct strategy in place, they can better understand, map, and measure what the return on investment and value from AI will be. It\u2019s also important to note that as AI becomes pervasive, job roles from entry level to the executive suite will change along with organizational structures and even entire industries. Company leaders must be willing to change and move with this disruption. They must consider how to engage and bring their people on the journey, how to drive adoption, and how to give employees the skills, confidence and ability to use this technology in their work.\n\nAMD CEO: Lisa Su AMD Tenure: 13 Years Has Been AMD CEO For: 11 Years The toughest challenge facing customers is the rapid pace of change. As technology advances, cutting-edge solutions like AI are essential to scaling business. However, new technologies also bring significant complexity and the need for business process innovation. We are committed to working closely with partners to help customers leverage end-to-end AI and high-performance computing solutions to navigate these changes.\n\nNutanix CEO: Rajiv Ramaswami Nutanix Tenure: 5 Years Has Been Nutanix CEO For: 5 Years One of the toughest challenges facing our customers is around understanding how AI can deliver business value and effectively unlocking the ROI in AI initiatives. Many organizations are working to bring strategic expectations around AI projects in line with budgets. Customers are also grappling with how to simplify how they run their applications and manage data in a hybrid multicloud world. Customers want deployment flexibility and one platform to run applications and data anywhere they need it, especially as IT complexity has continued to increase. Our software-defined architecture adapts to various hardware and cloud options to provide consistent operations and data services across cloud, edge, and core environments. Lastly, we continue to hear from our customers that they are thinking through their strategy going forward to reduce their risk following the Broadcom acquisition. Many VMware customers have concerns about pricing, lack of support, and a decreased focus on innovation. As customers are seeking to modernize their IT infrastructure, the decision to migrate away from VMware is well-timed as it provides an opportunity to future-proof their application strategies, especially as technologies like GenAI take hold.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO: Antonio Neri HPE Tenure: 30 Years Has Been HPE CEO For: 7 Years Customers and partners will continue to explore AI use cases for their businesses with an increasing pressure to move from experimentation to adoption. HPE and our partners are well positioned to help customers easily test proofs of concept and deploy them into production to solve this challenge. Our new turnkey HPE Private Cloud AI is a first-of-its-kind solution that provides deep integration with Nvidia AI computing, networking and software with HPE's AI storage, compute, and the HPE GreenLake cloud. The offering enables enterprises of every size to gain an energy-efficient, fast, and flexible path for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications.\n\nRed Hat CEO: Matt Hicks Red Hat Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Red Hat CEO For: 3 Years A major challenge for many customers will be the high price of innovation and the financial realities of investing in and implementing an AI strategy. For instance, training a single, general purpose large language model requires a lot of resources, with the largest AI models demanding some 10,000 GPUs and those models may already be out of date. In fact, research shows that by 2026, the cost of training frontier AI models will be equivalent to the US GDP which is $22 trillion. It should come as no surprise that the average CIO doesn't have a US GDP-level IT budget, nor do they have thousands of spare GPUs lying around. For Red Hat, the answer lies in optimized, built-to-purpose, and smaller, AI models driven by open source. If we look back on how the industry has evolved over the years, CIOs have long been moving away from monolithic technologies, starting with the shift from UNIX to Linux in the early 2000s. The industry is at a similar turning point now with huge, monolithic AI models taking center stage. So, the challenge for customers becomes exploring the options at their disposal for AI, understanding the associated costs of implementing and maintaining the technologies as well as necessary skills to do so, all while paving the way for the future of their business.\n\nLenovo CEO: Yuanqing Yang Lenovo Tenure: 20 Years Has Been Lenovo CEO For: 36 Years Sixty-one percent of CIOs find it challenging to demonstrate ROI from their AI investments or don't believe their organization has the proper skills to deploy AI. Many CIOs expect to wait two to three years to show any ROI. As AI innovators, it is our role to help demonstrate the value of AI and how we can deploy the technology at speed with our partners.\n\nExtreme Networks CEO: Ed Meyercord Extreme Networks Tenure: 10 Years Has Been Extreme Networks CEO For: 16 Years In a survey we conducted late last year of 200 CIOs and senior IT buyers, they told us their overwhelming focus is to improve the security of connected devices, while harnessing AI for tangible, ROI-focused use cases. The toughest challenges in 2025 will be managing and securing complex network architectures, addressing increasing cyber threats and smoothly and securely deploying AI. Extreme Platform ONE aims to address these challenges by integrating networking, security and AI solutions into a single framework, simplifying network management and enhancing security. The other significant challenge is AI and trust. At Extreme, we're focused on helping customers adopt AI at the pace of trust. There is no one size fits all with AI. We are working with customers and partners to help drive AI at a pace that they feel comfortable with and that is the beauty with the flexibility of Platform ONE, we can do that in a way that is meaningful and impactful.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2025 well underway, Jim Cramer hasn't been short of comments on artificial intelligence. AI stocks, which entered 2025 with optimism and tailwinds were dealt a shock during January's DeepSeek selloff. The selloff was centered around stocks of firms that investors believe stand to benefit from billions of dollars in AI GPU spending.\n\nThe firm that led the DeepSeek selloff was the AI GPU stock that has been Wall Street's favorite. Its shares dropped by 17% during the day and are flat year to date after having gained 17% since the selloff. Cramer has also been one of the firm's biggest fans. For instance, consider his remarks made in January before the selloff. Cramer started out by bemoaning a lack of knowledge about the firm and shared:\n\n\"Okay, some of the analysts are good, but some of the analysts are just talking about the quarter! And these are people, who are, they are bound by the four walls of idiocy. This is one of the greatest companies in the world, these people want to buy sell, buy sell, they don't recognize that [the firm] is doing things that are just running circles around.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer went as far as to suggest that the firm was ushering in an industrial revolution. According to him:\n\n\"Industrial revolution, why can't we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn't get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\"\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV show host had to naturally adjust his expectations after investors re-calibrated their AI GPU spending. Appearing on Squawk on the Street the day after the selloff, he shared two factors that would be key in determining the future of AI stock performance. According to Cramer, these factors are energy spending and GPU orders. Investors have focused on energy stocks, particularly those that deal with nuclear energy - a fact that has sent some stocks to gain as much as 140% over the past year. As for GPU orders, the Q4 2024 earnings season has seen big tech firms persist in their multi-billion dollar AI capital expenditure commitments.",

Last year, IBM Research released the Bee Agent Framework, a fully open-source and no-code platform to get started with agents.

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, International Business Machines' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 41% ownership\n\nalong with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nIf you want to know who really controls International Business Machines Corporation ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about International Business Machines.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in International Business Machines. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. With 8.5% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of International Business Machines\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of International Business Machines Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$261m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in International Business Machines. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that , you should know about...\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The generative AI-powered assistant is meant to streamline details about campus resources and how to seek them when it launches, expected in the fall semester, to the nearly 90,000 Penn State students.\n\nThe project stems from Penn State student leaders identifying a need for improved access to campus services, such as academic advising, health and wellness, and financial aid, while an analysis by the university discovered similar findings. In listening to students, Penn State and IBM are collaborating to create a concierge to help students navigate the many resources available to them, help increase support, and further advance satisfaction for the student body.\n\n\"At Penn State, student success is our priority, and this is an exciting step toward continuing to enhance the lives and experiences of students across our University,\" said Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi. \"We're thrilled to collaborate with IBM to leverage advancements like generative AI, a critical tool to help us create a more student-centered experience, remove barriers, improve retention rates and further achieve a sense of belonging for all Penn Staters by allowing our students to navigate our institution seamlessly and intuitively.\"\n\n\"IBM is honored to co-create a solution with Penn State that will play a significant role in its goal to advance engagement from students through an AI-infused assistant,\" said IBM General Manager, Public Sector Frank Attaie. \"Penn State students want quicker access to the important resources they need to be successful during their college experience and beyond. By integrating IBM's AI, Penn State can unlock new possibilities for its students.\"\n\nIBM consultants and experts are leveraging the conversational AI capabilities of watsonx Assistant to build MyResource. Watsonx.ai will be used to host, train and tune foundation models with data provided by Penn State. This will help the system promptly generate answers and recommendations with AI guardrails to detect and remove potentially harmful language or sensitive data. The tool will also use the conversational search capabilities within watsonx Discovery to help improve the quality and accuracy of the responses given by MyResource.\n\nAs part of this collaboration, IBM plans to bring this solution to other higher education institutions in the United States.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

            "content": "I\u2019m Brian Gordon, tech reporter for The News & Observer, and this is Open Source, a weekly newsletter on business, labor and technology in North Carolina.\n\nThe flurry of systemic changes by the new Trump administration has already been felt in North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle. Perhaps particularly so.\n\nAmong the roughly 1,000 Environmental Protection Agency workers who report to the agency\u2019s largest physical campus, in Research Triangle Park, more than 130 received an email last week emphasizing they could be fired at any time given their probationary status as new hires. At the same time, the government offered federal employees a deferred resignation that promised to pay them through September if they quit.\n\nThis buyout was communicated in a message with the subject line \u201cFork in the Road,\u201d which was the same phrase Elon Musk sent Twitter employees before he slashed jobs at the company. The administration subsequently sent multiple messages throughout the week reminding employees of the offer and its Thursday deadline.\n\nRegardless of politics \u2014 the impact of cutting EPA staff and the size of the federal government overall \u2014 this past week presented a tricky decision for the Triangle\u2019s newest EPA employees. Quit and potentially get months of pay? Or roll the dice without job protections?\n\nHolly Wilson, an EPA employee and president of the local union chapter, said more than one colleague reached out for advice. Hours before the buyout deadline Thursday, a federal judge paused the program, with a hearing on the program now scheduled for Monday.\n\nImpact of USAID cuts\n\nAnother place where the Triangle has been uniquely affected by the administration is through the gutting of USAID. Again, this isn\u2019t an exploration of whether USAID should exist. But among the six nonprofits that receive the most funding from the agency, two are based locally.\n\nOpen Source\n\nThat would be FHI 360 (No. 3) and RTI International (No. 6). On Friday, the latter furloughed a third of its U.S. staff, including more than 200 workers in North Carolina. Over 60% of FHI 360\u2019s annual revenue comes from USAID (more than $500 million in 2023).\n\nRTI International hasn\u2019t given an update. As an original RTP tenant, it is among Durham County\u2019s 10 largest employers.\n\nLastly, local startup leaders say the Trump administration\u2019s halting of federal research grants led to a chaotic week. \u201cWe have about half a million dollars that were pending reimbursements that we weren\u2019t sure if we were going to get,\u201d one Durham founder said.\n\nNorth Carolina has the ninth largest population but receives the sixth most grant funding through the National Institutes of Health. More than half of this nearly $2 billion went to Duke University and UNC-Chapel Hill last year.\n\nNIH grant payments and reviews have resumed, a development that should be welcomed in the research-focused Triangle.\n\nClearing my cache\n\nIBM is increasingly becoming a software company, and arguably a more interesting one, thanks to its acquisition of the Raleigh open source giant Red Hat .\n\nToyota says it will start shipping electric vehicle batteries from its new North Carolina factory in April. It is the carmaker\u2019s first EV battery facility in the U.S. and Toyota aims to have 3,000 workers there by end of this year.\n\nThousands of Amazon warehouse workers in Garner will have the chance to vote on a union starting Monday.\n\nThe publicly traded Wilmington fintech company nCino has a new CEO.\n\nCold-Link Logistics , a cold storage operator, promises 123 new jobs in the small city of Lumberton, 90 minutes south of Raleigh.\n\nHoneywell, the Charlotte-based conglomerate, is splitting into three publicly traded companies. It currently employs 1,150 in the Queen City.\n\nAn aerial view of the Red Hat building in downtown Raleigh Thursday, Feb. 16, 2023.\n\nNational Tech Happenings\n\nBarnes & Noble is having a moment. Buoyed by viral online hits, the brick-and-mortar bookseller opened nearly 60 stores last year, and plans to open at least as many in 2025.\n\nOpenAI is scouting more U.S. sites for its future data center network, part of the President Donald Trump-backed Stargate project to support artificial intelligence technologies. North Carolina isn\u2019t one of the 16 states being considered.\n\nFirst TikTok, next DeepSeek?

            "content": "AI is no longer a luxury but a necessity. And while necessity is the mother of invention, Australian CIOs may struggle to get everyone in the boardroom, well, on board. Australian organisations are not moving as quickly as their counterparts in preparing for and fully adopting AI for business transformation.\n\nResearch from IBM indicates that only 15% of global businesses have established themselves as leaders in AI implementation, while the majority remain in early experimental phases.\n\nOne way to address this challenge is with clarity and direction. The top barriers hindering enterprises globally from adopting AI are a lack of a clear AI strategy and investment, highlights the IBM AI in Action report.\n\nWhat is value stream mapping?\n\nValue stream mapping is a powerful technique making a big difference in this space. Derived from Lean manufacturing principles, this technique essentially creates a visual representation of all the components necessary to deliver a product or service, considering the people, processes, information, and inventory involved from start to finish.\n\n\u201cValue stream mapping lays bare the delays and inefficiencies in a given workflow,\u201d explains John Hanna, Neudesic Australia. \u201cThis allows executives, leaders, and teams to work together to find gaps, understand pain points, and build a better AI strategy.\u201d\n\nFor utilities in particular, it helps teams identify high-impact opportunities. For example, mapping the time taken for tasks such as rate case submissions can pinpoint where AI can streamline processes. By evaluating metrics like lead time (time to start an action) and cycle time (time spent on productive work), utilities can identify repetitive tasks that can be automated.\n\n\u201cRegularly reviewing the mapped process allows stakeholders to identify outdated approvals or unnecessary steps that slow progress. Knowledge like this is crucial to help utilities face today\u2019s uncertain economic climate,\u201d Hanna remarks.\n\nSuch insights also reveal complexities and bottlenecks that may not be apparent when teams only view their part of the process. \u201cBy collaborating across departments, organisations can gain valuable insights into how each step impacts the entire workflow so that they can make meaningful, impactful improvements,\u201d Hanna adds.\n\nImplementing AI with confidence\n\nMapping like this represents the first step towards building a culture of continuous improvement and adaptability, ensuring that utility companies can rapidly respond to evolving regulations and changing market demands. Working with a trusted industry leader is a surefire way to do this confidently.\n\nGlobal professional services leader Neudesic, an IBM Company, is a proven expert in value stream mapping. Neudesic leverages extensive industry expertise and advanced skills in Microsoft Azure, AI, data engineering, and analytics to help businesses meet the growing demands of AI.\n\nThe company\u2019s approach, which comprises four pillars, helps organisations to transform legacy systems into AI-ready environments:\n\nPeople: Its diverse array of internal experts spanning industries, skillsets, and Microsoft Azure and OpenAI solutions help clients address a wide spectrum of business challenges for any type of organisation\n\nApproach: It achieves results not only by implementing Microsoft and OpenAI solutions, but also by addressing today\u2019s challenges, identifying tomorrow\u2019s opportunities, and designing the best path forward\n\nTechnology: It focuses on innovation to develop solutions that meet clients\u2019 needs while accelerating time to value\n\nExpertise: With 20 years of expertise in Microsoft\u2019s stack, it offers clients expert knowledge to tackle critical IT challenges and unlock new opportunities\n\nArmed with insights through mapping, CIOs can start with small, quick successes and therefore gain stakeholder support early on. For instance, using AI to automate document preparation can cut processing time from hours to minutes. One utility that Neudesic worked with recently saved nearly $1 million by streamlining less than 40 documents.\n\nHanna goes on to share three tips for CIOs to develop an effective AI strategy.\n\nFirst, set clear objectives and success metrics. Agree on clear, measurable goals for AI projects that match business priorities and ensure everyone understands the desired results. Understanding customer behaviour is key to shaping these goals as it helps businesses adapt to changes, connect better with customers, and increase revenue.\n\nNext, encourage cross-functional collaboration. Involve teams from various departments, such as IT, operations, and finance, from the outset. This ensures the AI models are selected and refined to meet project requirements effectively.\n\nFinally, apply the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d principle when evaluating AI projects. Choose use cases that balance complexity, feasibility, and value. Consider factors like data type, problem scope, resource availability, and interpretability.\n\nValue stream mapping isn\u2019t just a tool. It\u2019s the flashlight guiding you through a labyrinth of inefficiencies and untapped potential. With clarity and direction, Australian organisations can leap forward from aspiration to action.\n\nWith the right strategy and partners like Neudesic, you can ensure your AI journey doesn\u2019t just keep pace but sets the standard.\n\nLearn more about how Neudesic can help Australian organisations go forward in AI, confidently.",

            "content": "AI is evolving rapidly, and so are the benchmarks that measure their progress. Benchmarks are essentially tests of how well AI models can carry out a task or achieve a target goal, giving people a way to compare models and select the best one for their needs.\n\nBut benchmarks have flaws. They may not adequately measure the skills their creators intended, and with time, they can drift into irrelevancy as questions become too easy. There is also evidence to suggest they are becoming easier to game, as more models train on data scraped from the web, including the problems in benchmarks themselves. The practical implications of this are that models that have ascended prominent leaderboards may prove far less capable in real life.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture of AI aptitude, researchers at IBM, University of Michigan, and Tel Aviv University have created a new, dynamic benchmark for visual document understanding tasks. LiveXiv (pronounced \u201clive-kive\u201d), provides an evolving set of test questions corresponding to images in the latest papers posted on arXiv, a platform for sharing scientific research. Updated automatically once a month, LiveXiv may be the largest, most comprehensive benchmark yet for evaluating VLMs on their ability to analyze charts, tables, diagrams, and other images.\n\nOne of the downsides of updating benchmarks this often is that, while cheating becomes harder, the cost of re-evaluating and re-ranking models becomes more costly. To make live benchmarks more feasible, the researchers also devised a statistical shortcut for re-evaluating a full leaderboard. In a paper to be presented at the upcoming International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), they show that their method can accurately estimate model performance using 70% less data and computation.\n\n\"That evaluation is important, and it's important to do it efficiently,\" said the study's lead author, Nimrod Shabtay, a researcher at IBM who is also a PhD student at Tel Aviv University.\n\nBenchmarking AI at the pace of scientific progress\n\nModern AI depends on data. To continue improving their models, companies now routinely crawl the web for new content to feed them. This shift to automated data gathering has increased the odds that AI models have effectively seen the test before taking it. This is known as benchmark contamination.\n\nIn the last year or so, a series of dynamic benchmarks have emerged in response. The researchers took inspiration from one of them, a comprehensive benchmark called LiveBench that uses arXiv papers, among other sources, to assesses LLMs on their math and linguistic \u2018reasoning\u2019 skills. But rather than focus solely on text, the researchers chose to zero in on visual reasoning tasks important to enterprises. To make their benchmark as efficient and as scalable as possible, they also introduced automation into the benchmark creation and model evaluation process.\n\nOne pillar of this automated pipeline is Docling, IBM\u2019s open-source toolkit for document conversion. The researchers used Docling to turn raw PDF pages from the web into structured, machine-readable documents. They also harnessed a pair of language models to convert the documents into more than 16,000 questions and answers about the graphs, tables, and charts within.\n\nNow in its fifth month \u2014 and fifth iteration \u2014 the current version of LiveXiv draws from more than 300 arXiv papers across 14 domains.\n\nLiveXiv tests vision-language models on a variety of tasks that involve 'reasoning' over images and their corresponding text\n\nQuick comparisons\n\nEach time a benchmark gets updated, ideally each model on the leaderboard gets re-evaluated. But the cost of running dozens of models again on the newest benchmark can quickly become cost prohibitive. Inspired by the rise of \u201ctiny\u201d benchmarks that can gauge model performance from a few strategically picked questions, the researchers came up with a solution for LiveXiv.\n\nA tiny benchmark can infer from a few AI model responses how it\u2019s likely to do on the complete test. Similarly, the LiveXiv solution estimates from a subset of AI model results how the rest of the field will perform. In experiments to validate their approach, they found that re-evaluating just five out of 17 VLMs was enough to accurately predict the performance of the entire cast.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \"there's still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\" He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper's comments about the market were precarious and didn't reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \"I mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation's precarious on Squawk Box. And it's not.\"\n\nInstead, Cramer shared \"These are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let's make a talk. Let's do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it's not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President's strategy, I think people say, is working.\" As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \"And the answer is why you would sell is because you don't believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn't exist. I come back and say, well I don't know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\"\n\nThe CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \"how can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they're getting that in spade,\" on the other hand he agreed that \"Yes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we're gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\"\n\nIn fact, Cramer was surprised by the President's China approach. He had \"expected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\"",

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nLast week\u2019s 3.5% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 44% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for International Business Machines\n\nNYSE:IBM Ownership Breakdown February 15th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:IBM Earnings and Revenue Growth February 15th 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. International Business Machines is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. With 8.5% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.",

            "content": "\u201cWe would never tell a company what its dividend should or should not be. Instead, we prefer to afford the management teams of companies in which we invest the space and the confidence to cut their dividend if they feel it is unsustainable or the money is better spent elsewhere. Far better it takes that approach than overstretch its balance sheet to pay a dividend it cannot afford.\u201d\n\nWhile a dividend cut poses a risk, it can also create opportunities. Short-term investors focused solely on high dividends often sell their shares when a company reduces its payout. This can open the door for long-term, value-oriented investors to purchase shares at more attractive prices. Simon Adler, value equity fund manager at Schroders, made the following comment about this:\n\nThe year 2020 served as a significant test of dividend durability among these companies. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March, consumer demand in several industries declined sharply. As a result, numerous companies either cut or suspended their dividends, some voluntarily and others as a condition of accepting government stimulus funds. By the end of 2020, a total of 66 companies in the broader market had distributed less in dividends than they had in 2019, according to a report by Morningstar.\n\nA company\u2019s history of annual dividend increases, regardless of its length, does not guarantee that future payouts are secure. However, when management frequently highlights these streaks in earnings calls and annual reports, it suggests a strong commitment to maintaining and growing dividends when making capital allocation decisions. Even so, history shows that some Dividend Aristocrats have had to reduce their payouts, leading to their removal from the list.\n\nDividend Aristocrats refer to companies with a strong track record of increasing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. These stocks are often favored by investors due to their reputation as dependable sources of income. A company\u2019s ability to raise dividends consistently over decades is considered an indicator of financial resilience and stability. In addition, these stocks have demonstrated strong long-term performance, often surpassing other asset classes. According to a ProShares report citing FactSet data, the Dividend Aristocrat Index delivered a notable return of 27.7% between March 2022 and April 2023, outperforming the broader market, which posted a 25.2% return over the same period.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Cheapest Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other cheapest dividend aristocrats to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend-paying stocks are often linked to value investing, as they typically offer higher yields and stronger financial fundamentals compared to growth stocks. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices noted that income-focused investment strategies tend to exhibit characteristics associated with value stocks. Companies with high dividend yields and lower valuations frequently draw investor interest. However, the report also highlighted that the Dividend Aristocrats Index is not strictly value-focused. Instead, it maintains a balance between growth and value stocks. A long-term analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 showed that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings fell into the value category, while 40.94% were classified as growth stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned the list of the Dividend Aristocrats, the stocks that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. From this group, we identified 10 stocks with the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. The chosen stocks featured in the list exhibit a forward P/E ratio below 25 as of February 14. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their P/E ratios.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) the Cheapest Dividend Aristocrat Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 23.8\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational tech company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. Oppenheimer believes that investors have yet to fully recognize the company\u2019s shift toward a stronger focus on software. The investment firm began coverage of the tech giant with an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating. Analyst Param Singh set a price target of $320 per share, indicating a potential upside of approximately 28%. Singh also expects IBM\u2019s valuation to increase over time as the market gains a better understanding of its strategic move toward software.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) announced revenue of $17.6 billion, marking a 1% increase from the same quarter in the previous year. The Software segment saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong demand for Red Hat. Businesses across the globe are turning to IBM for AI-powered transformation, with its generative AI segment exceeding $5 billion in total revenue\u2014an increase of nearly $2 billion from the prior quarter.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported a strong cash performance in 2024, generating $13.4 billion in operating cash flow and $12.7 billion in free cash flow. During the fourth quarter, IBM distributed $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividend payments. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.57%, as of February 14. IBM is one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks as the company has raised its payouts for 29 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 10th on our list of cheapest dividend aristocrats to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

IBM historically focused on business consulting and manufacturing hardware like servers, storage systems and network equipment. In 2005, software accounted for 18% of the company\u2019s revenue. By 2019, the year IBM acquired the Raleigh software giant Red Hat for $34 billion, software was still only a quarter of its total revenue.\n\nIn the past six years however, Red Hat has helped IBM overhaul its portfolio. Kavanaugh told investors Tuesday that software is now 45% of IBM \u2014 with the segment projected to soon reach 50%.\n\n\u201cSoftware is taking the baton from consulting and becoming the key to IBM\u2019s revenue, profit and free cash flow growth over the next 3 years,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in an investor note Wednesday.\n\nListen to any recent IBM earnings call and the catalyst for this transition is easy to spot.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, IBM recorded 22 consecutive fiscal quarters of declining revenue growth as it struggled to move from traditional hardware \u2014 with its one-time sales and fixed equipment costs \u2014 toward cloud computing. Red Hat has provided a jolt. Of the 22 quarters since IBM bought Red Hat, the Raleigh company has grown by at least 10% in all but four of them.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see momentum in Red Hat with fourth-quarter revenue growth of 17%, fueled by six consecutive quarters of double-digit bookings growth,\u201d Kavanaugh said during the company\u2019s Jan. 29 earnings call.\n\nSince the acquisition, Red Hat\u2019s annual revenue has almost doubled from $3.4 billion to more than $6.5 billion. IBM has in recent years reversed its overall declines, albeit with smaller increases, and its stock is currently near an all-time high.\n\nBeyond hard figures, Red Hat\u2019s addition has coincided with heightened excitement around the parent company. In its latest analyst report, the investment firm BMO Capital Markets said the strong attendance at this year\u2019s Investor Day \u201creflects incremental interest in IBM compared to historical events.\u201d\n\nBoth IBM and Red Hat are major employers in the Triangle. The former has the seventh-largest workforce in Durham County, state records show, with offices in Research Triangle Park, while Red Hat \u2014 headquartered in downtown Raleigh \u2014 is a top-20 employer in Wake County.\n\nAn aerial view of the Red Hat building in downtown Raleigh Thursday, Feb. 16, 2023.\n\nFounded in 1993, Red Hat is the world\u2019s top provider of open source software. The company uses an operating system called Linux, which anyone can access for free. What is sells are bespoke Linux-based packages that enable customers to run their businesses efficiently.\n\nRed Hat\u2019s flagship product is Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL. The company has also reported significant growth in its hybrid cloud platform OpenShift, which has ballooned from $100 million in annual sales to more than $1.4 billion today.\n\nOn last week\u2019s earnings call, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna highlighted the role Red Hat plays as the parent company pursues artificial intelligence. Krishna highlighted how Red Hat software is being paired with Neural Magic, a generative AI firm IBM bought last year.\n\nYet while AI represents potential, investors say the value Red Hat gives IBM is in its steady subscription-based returns.\n\nIn its latest analyst note, the investment firm Melius Research compared the Red Hat acquisition to buying an annuity \u2014 an insurance company product that guarantees buyers regular income. Confident that IBM will continue collecting returns, as customer demand for enterprise Linux services appear stable, Melius gave the company a share target of $290 \u2014 a 12% increase from its current price.\n\nEnjoy Triangle tech news?

            "content": "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC announced today plans to build a $360 million state-of-the-art data center at its facility in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. The data center will include new technologies and services that will enable IBM to deliver Cloud Computing capabilities to clients.\n\nCloud computing uses advanced technologies and global delivery mechanisms to enable individuals to access information and services from any device with extremely high levels of availability and quality of experience.\n\nIBM will renovate an existing building on its RTP campus in North Carolina to create one of the most technologically advanced and energy efficient data centers in the world. The new data center will be the first in the world to be built with IBM's New Enterprise Data Center design principles. Clients using this center will have unparalleled access to massive internet-scale computing capabilities, while gaining the cost and environmental protection advantages of IBM's industry-leading energy efficiency data center design.\n\nData centers are the backbone of information technology (IT) infrastructure for businesses and other organizations, with powerful servers and storage systems running business-critical technology including software applications, email and web sites. IBM owns and operates more than eight million square feet of data center space -- more than any other company in the world.\n\nThis new RTP data center is a key component in IBM's Project Big Green initiative to dramatically increase energy efficiency in the data center, as companies face escalating energy costs and the requirement to handle a rapidly rising amount of data.\n\n\"This announcement further demonstrates IBM's commitment to our state and to our people,\" said Gov. Mike Easley. \"I look forward to maintaining this partnership with IBM for years to come.\"\n\n\"This new data center is part of IBM's commitment to construct the world's most advanced data centers,\" said Bob Greenberg, general manager of IT Optimization and North Carolina Senior State Executive at IBM. \"This is the latest example of IBM's deep history of innovation in North Carolina. When we open for business in late 2009, the new IBM data center assures that Research Triangle Park will be a strategic location for our outsourcing business for many years to come. I'd like to thank the State of North Carolina, Durham County, the Durham Chamber of Commerce, and Duke Energy for their outstanding support that helped make this project possible.\"\n\n\"IBM's innovations have been a cornerstone of the Research Triangle Park and Durham County, and this new state-of-the-art data center certainly continues that outstanding legacy,\" said Ellen W. Reckhow, Chairman of the Durham County Board of Commissioners. Durham County approved allocating $750,000 in economic development incentives for IBM's new data center.\n\nTechnology features and details on the new RTP data center\n\nThe new RTP data center will use many of the technologies from IBM's Project Big Green initiative to sharply reduce data center energy consumption. Following the first phase of 60,000 square feet of raised floor data center space, this site can potentially be expanded in standard modular increments. In IBM's new Data Center Family of services, design is typically performed in advance on an entire project, so the additional capacity can be added as client demand dictates. With a modular approach, it's easier to grow the space and defer significant capital costs.\n\nAlong with the recently commissioned Boulder data center, the new RTP facility will be IBM's first truly adaptive data center, where facilities equipment is designed to adjust its operation to the needs of IT equipment in the data center. These data centers will be specially designed for a heterogeneous mix of computer hardware and software.\n\nIBM will also incorporate its High Density Zone solution into the data center design. This will enable IBM to support the latest water-cooled equipment and energy requirements, as well as to optimize its infrastructure for traditional and new air-cooled equipment.\n\nSome other key design features:\n\n-- IBM goals include reusing 95 percent of the original building's shell, recycling 90 percent of materials from the original building, with 20 percent of newly purchased material to be from recycled products. -- IBM plans to install high density computing systems utilizing virtualization technology, which reduces energy costs by running multiple software applications on the same servers. This technology, along with IBM's Cool Blue portfolio of energy efficient technologies and a modular data center design, will allow the RTP facility to offer IBM's clients up to three times more computing capacity per square foot than the average data center. -- The data center will leverage an industry-leading integrated cooling system allowing it to respond to varying cooling requirements of the IT equipment in real time. -- During colder months, the data center can switch to free-cooling mode, utilizing a water economizer to dramatically reduce energy consumption. -- The data center's mechanical system design is 50 percent more efficient than the industry average, equating to a reduction of approximately 31,799 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year. -- The facility is planned to be partially powered by alternative energy sources, resulting in a targeted reduction of approximately one million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year. -- The data center will provide dual-site backup and recovery offerings from IBM's Business Continuity and Resiliency Services, in conjunction with IBM's recently enhanced Boulder, Colorado data center. -- The facility will use energy efficient lighting, and all critical systems will be monitored and alarmed to security and maintenance 24x7x365.\n\nThese technologies, in conjunction with the energy efficient design and construction, will allow IBM to reduce its overall carbon footprint compared to standard data centers.\n\nMore information about IBM can be found at www.ibm.com.\n\nNote to Editors: Images and broadcast-quality b-roll are available for download by registered journalists at www.thenewsmarket.com/ibm.\n\nIBM, the IBM logo, Data Center Family and Cool Blue are trademarks or registered trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation.

            "content": "IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned +16.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIBM is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%. This estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.59 indicates a change of +7.6% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.",

This creates a hybrid-by-default approach that leads to a lack of strategic IT foundation where the elements required to manage the cloud remain in silos, as Deloitte described it.\n\nHybrid by design puts interoperability at its core through intelligent and intentional vertical and horizontal integration of technology components. Hybrid by design centers on a platforming approach that enables common innovation and operation practices. It significantly reduces the complexity of managing the hybrid environment while improving the gains from it.\n\n\n\nFurther, enterprises have increased adoption of technology approaches such as platform engineering, which uses self-service capabilities and automated infrastructure operations to improve developer experience and productivity. Platform engineering is often a response to the ever-growing complexity of modern software architectures and hybrid cloud environments.\n\nBusiness innovation requires organizations to deploy technology wherever the business operates and needs it, such as a cloud, a data center, an edge location or a device. It requires tight coordination between technical architecture, operations, teams and culture to succeed.\n\nHybrid by design prevents deployment heterogeneity that turns into technical and operational heterogeneity that we often see in hybrid by default.\n\nThe reality is that running across multiple environments creates a complexity that spans data centers, multiple clouds, existing tech stacks and teams. But migrating to the public cloud, specifically, without improving and streamlining the platform that manages those environments is also a recipe for inefficiency and spiraled costs.\n\n\n\nHybrid by default\u2019s siloed environments do nothing to reduce the complexity of the cloud. What businesses do get are rising costs and a minimizing of any positive impact the cloud might have on the organization. It is the equivalent of a hotel setting up security cameras everywhere but not establishing a control center where someone can monitor them all at once.\n\nHybrid by design is the correct methodology for every organization considering the importance of digital transformation, the increasing dependency on the cloud and the looming opportunity inherent in artificial intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s why hybrid by design was used in IBM CIO transformation as client-zero, which led to significant decreases in hosting costs and platform operations headcount required. It resulted in 90% savings in hosting cost, 55% decrease in platform operations headcount and $200M in savings by using Apptio\u2019s integrated suite.\n\nAn IBM Consulting analysis of more than 50 clients found that those who incorporated hybrid-by-design principles had three times higher ROI from IT programs over five years, primarily driven by consistency across platforms, processes and people. This number is further expected to be amplified by extensive use of generative AI.\n\n",

When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.\n\nBefore we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.\n\nHaving given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in IBM positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:\n\nIn terms of shares owned, we count 10 of the above funds having increased existing IBM positions from 09/30/2024 to 12/31/2024, with 10 having decreased their positions.\n\nLooking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the IBM share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held IBM at the 12/31/2024 reporting period (out of the 5,177 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of IBM shares those same funds held back at the 09/30/2024 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for IBM. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 9,640,227 shares in the aggregate, from 331,785,915 up to 341,426,142 for a share count increase of approximately 2.91%.

While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM).\n\n10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\n\u0095 ETF Finder\n\n\u0095 TCRR Insider Buying\n\n\u0095 Funds Holding RNDV\n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

That avoids the cost of a formal layoff or \"resource action,\" as Big Blue likes to call it.\n\n\"People are being forcibly pushed out but in a way that does not look like typical layoffs to avoid public scrutiny,\" our source explained, noting that the tech giant is keen to avoid the perception that it's trying to get rid of older workers, an issue in numerous past lawsuits. \"It is also to divest from areas executives no longer see as strategic.\"\n\nDuring IBM's Q4 2024 financial call in January, CFO James Kavanaugh anticipated that cost-cutting with regard to employees will continue at a pace comparable to last year. \"We expect workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with prior years,\" said the exec.\n\nIn 2024 \u2013 a year for IBM that began with a headcount of about 288,000 \u2013 the IT titan took a \"workforce rebalancing\" to cover layoffs for \"a very low single digit percentage of IBM\u2019s global workforce,\" the corporation told The Register several months ago.\n\nBased on IBM's reported $700 million \"workforce rebalancing\" charge for that year, we estimate that around 9,000 employees \u2013 about three percent of the workforce \u2013 were let go in 2024, based on data from the year before. In 2023, the biz announced 3,900 layoffs and took a $300 million charge in the first quarter, a figure ultimately adjusted upward to $400 million for the full year.\n\nOur source said the message internally is that people will be hired to replace those who leave, but specifics have not been provided. Our contact reported knowing of several people who have accepted separation packages and one person who will be moving to a different state.\n\n\"Middle managers are worried because they see teams losing many skills and this decision is making a big impact,\" we're told. \"Over the past year, people were quietly offered voluntary retirement or an exit. The CEO has stated, 'thousands will be replaced by AI,' and management is currently heavily focused on cuts and slowing hiring. He said thousands, but it will likely be in the tens of thousands of people who are replaced over the next several years.\"\n\nAI will be implemented to reduce the workforce ... by focusing on hiring people in AI, machine learning, and data science\n\nInside IBM, we're told, employees are still trying to figure out how to make use of watsonx, Big Blue's enterprise AI service.\n\n\"For example, last year, they voluntold people to use Watson Chat Assistant, and create a use case and strategy for it,\" our source explained. \"Teams were then ranked and winners were selected.\"\n\nThe hope is that winning ideas can be deployed to help operations.

            "content": "Usually, when we want to simulate a quantum state using quantum circuits, we prepare some initial state and use unitary operators\u2014quantum logic gates\u2014to evolve it over time. Once we reach the end of the circuit, we take measurements that collapse the quantum state into a classical one, yielding the information we sought to glean from our simulation. Or at least that's one way of doing things.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are investigating quantum algorithms that use the act of measurement itself not only to extract information from quantum states, but also to steer and manipulate them as they evolve in time. This can be particularly helpful when it comes to generating entanglement, an essential task in quantum information processing. Entanglement generation in purely unitary circuits often leads to high-depth circuits that are beyond the capabilities of today\u2019s hardware. Quantum circuits that incorporate measurement\u2014for example, dynamic circuits that allow us to perform logical operations in our circuits based on mid-circuit measurements\u2014can be much more efficient.\n\nIn recent blog posts, we\u2019ve seen dynamic circuits enable efficient measurement-based methods for entangling disconnected qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and even for entangling qubits on separate processors. A paper published in Nature Physics highlights more of the many capabilities measurement-based quantum protocols can enable, underscoring their potential to support progress in fields like condensed-matter physics and quantum error correction.\n\nIn that paper, researchers from IBM, University of Cologne, and Harvard demonstrate an efficient measurement-based protocol for generating a simple long-range ordered state\u2014i.e., a quantum state in which long-range entanglements are maintained across significant distances within the system. Crucially, we were able to achieve this at the utility scale, using as many as 125 qubits on an IBM Quantum\u2122 Eagle processor to build long-range order across up to 54 qubits.\n\nBy tuning both coherent and incoherent error rates in their quantum circuit, we show that it is possible to maintain this long-range order in two spatial dimensions up to a critical point known as the Nishimori transition. We then use a classical decoder to ascertain the signature of the long-range ordered state. Prior to this experiment, it was not known whether it was actually possible to create and validate this kind of long-range order in a quantum circuit given the presence of measurement error.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll dive into the details of the experiment and show how the protocols we developed alongside our collaborators at University of Cologne and Harvard could significantly enhance quantum simulations of different phases of matter relevant to condensed-matter physics and other fields of physics research. We\u2019ll also discuss how these new methods help to reveal fascinating insights into the nature of quantum information itself.\n\nInterested in realizing a Nishimori phase transition on your own? Recreate the experiment with an IBM Quantum processor by following our tutorial on IBM Quantum Learning.\n\nExploring phase transition with quantum circuits\n\nIn our experiments, we set out to simulate the \u201cphase transition\u201d of a disordered quantum state evolving into a long-range ordered state. In particular, we set our sights on realizing the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state\u2014the simplest example of long-range order in quantum systems, and one of the few large-scale entangled quantum states that have been well-studied. You can also think of the GHZ state as the ground state of the random bond Ising model, a simplified model of magnetism that is used widely in physics research and which served as the model of interest in the 2023 IBM Quantum utility experiment.\n\nWe should note that the utility experiment concerned the transverse-field Ising model where spins interact with a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the spins\u2019 alignment. This experiment, on the other hand, centers on the random bond Ising model, where the spin system tends to exist in a disordered state due to variations in the strength of interactions between the neighboring spins.\n\nSo, what is a phase transition? If you\u2019ve ever watched an ice cube melt into liquid water, then you\u2019ve witnessed one first hand. When the ice molecules reach melting temperature, they enter into a kind of intermediate state, where they are essentially unsure of whether they want to remain in the rigid crystalline structure of the ice cube, or enter into the more chaotic state of water\u2019s liquid phase. The transformation that turns ice into liquid water is a phase transition.\n\nSimulating the phase transition of the GHZ state from long-range order to disorder and back again is kind of like taking an ice cube, melting it, and freezing it again. However, instead of being made up of water molecules, the GHZ state is made up of \u201cspins.\u201d In an Ising model system, you can think of a spin as an atom-sized magnet arranged into a grid-like structure or \u201clattice\u201d with other spins to make up some larger magnetic material. The spin can point in one of two directions, either up or down.\n\nPhysicists are often interested in the question of whether the spins in a lattice all want to be aligned, or if they all want to be random. In the 1970s, theoretical physicist Hidetoshi Nishimori identified the now famous Nishimori line, which illustrates this transition from order to disorder in spin glass models\n\nWhat is a spin glass? A spin glass is a type of magnetic state that is studied in condensed-matter physics. It is characterized by disorder and random interactions between individual spins within the system.\n\nlike the random bond Ising model used for this experiment. You can see this illustrated in the image below.\n\nA long-range ordered system is, as you might guess, a system in which the spins are all aligned in either the spin up state or the spin down state. When we increase the system\u2019s temperature or disorder probability, we push it from the long-range ordered phase into the disordered phase\u2014with the system following the path of the Nishimori line. The crossover point between long-range order and disorder, marked in the figure above in blue, is known as the Nishimori transition or the Nishimori \u201ccriticality.\u201d The red point marked at the bottom of the chart is the GHZ state.\n\nAs far as we know, creating a truly long-range ordered state in a real magnetic material is not possible because it would require actively tuning the individual atomic-scale properties of the material. Real magnets always have tiny imperfections\u2014individual atoms whose spin does not align with the rest of the system. In our Nature Physics experiment, however, we showed that we can use the qubits in an IBM quantum computer to simulate the interaction between spins in a lattice, and dynamically tune the individual magnets within the lattice to realize the phase transition between disorder and long-range order.\n\nPrior to this experiment, it was unknown whether this kind of tuning could be performed in the presence of measurement error. Our research shows that is possible to manipulate the spin degree of freedom in qubits in a controllable way, much like we boil water by applying heat, and we were able to do this in a quantum computer despite the fact that our implementation of this phase transition is inherently noisy.\n\nRealizing the GHZ state and the Nishimori transition in superconducting quantum circuits\n\nWe ran our simulation experiments on ibm_sherbrooke , a 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle processor. To create the GHZ state with their measurement-based protocol, we begin by dividing the processor\u2019s qubits into two categories\u2014the system qubits that will make up the GHZ state, and the auxiliary qubits that serve to prepare and measure the GHZ state. In the image below, you can see how we divided up the processor\u2019s qubits for our largest simulation, which we ran on 125 of the ibm_sherbrooke \u2019s 127 qubits:\n\nAs you can see, the system qubits that will represent the GHZ state are colored black, while the auxiliary qubits are colored gray. Gray auxiliary qubits are placed in between each of the black system qubits so that no two system qubits are directly adjacent. You\u2019ll also notice some color coding in the physical connections or \u201cbonds\u201d that connect each qubit to its nearest neighbors. The bonds are divided into three groups\u2014blue, red, and gray. This detail will be important for executing the circuit protocol.\n\nThe protocol begins with all qubits initialized into the ground state. In a perfect, error-free world, we could create a GHZ state without using any auxiliary qubits or mid-circuit measurements at all. We would simply initialize the system qubits, use purely unitary, two-qubit entangling gates to entangle each pair of neighboring qubits, and measure the qubits at the end of this simple circuit to reveal the desired long-range ordered state.\n\nOf course, we do not live in an error-free world. Gate errors, measurement errors, and other kinds of error inevitably throw the system out of long-range order, or prevent us from determining whether long-range order has been achieved. That\u2019s where the auxiliary qubits play a role. To better understand their purpose, let\u2019s zoom in on a small sub section of the processor\u2019s qubits\u2014two system qubits connected by an auxiliary qubit in between them:\n\nWe begin the protocol by applying separate Hadamard gates to each individual qubit, preparing all three qubits in their own separate superposition states. Our goal is to entangle the two system qubits, which we do by applying two qubit gates. However, in superconducting quantum processors, we can only apply two qubit gates to qubits that are directly adjacent to each other, and the system qubits are separated by the auxiliary qubit that sits in between them. To connect the two system qubits, we\u2019ll need to perform a simple quantum teleportation experiment.\n\nFirst, we entangle each of the system qubits to the auxiliary qubit using local unitary two-qubit gates. At this point, all three qubits are highly entangled - but we only need the two system qubits to be entangled. So we apply another Hadamard gate to the auxiliary qubit, which upon measurement, creates a maximally entangled Bell pair between the two adjacent system qubits.\n\nWe can extend this small, three-qubit example to all system qubits, performing the same entangling operations across all system qubits and the auxiliary qubits that sit in between them. More specifically, we first apply our two-qubit gates simultaneously to all qubits connected by gray-colored bonds, then to all qubits connected by red-colored bonds, and finally to all qubits connected by blue-colored bonds. This method allows us to maintain constant-depth in the circuit and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. It also creates a macroscopic GHZ state across all system qubits with the auxiliary qubits serving as bridges for the entanglement.\n\nThis raises two important questions:\n\nHow do we actually verify that we have made the transition from disorder to long-range order? How can we observe the nature of this phase transition and determine whether it follows the famous Nishimori line?\n\nTo answer the first question, all we have to do is projectively measure all auxiliary qubits, and feed those measurement outcomes into a function on a classical computer that allows us to decode the state of the remaining system qubits. This classical decoder helps us verify that the system qubits have achieved the long-range order of the GHZ state.\n\nTo probe the nature of this phase transition from disordered to ordered, we can manually inject errors into the circuit\u2014both the coherent errors that distort interactions between qubits, and the incoherent errors that corrupt the communications channel between the quantum computer and the classical decoder. This gives us the ability to observe how the quantum state evolves as the disorder probability is tuned up and down. The macroscopic behavior of all pair-wise correlations in the system, upon injecting both types of errors, reveals that our quantum state follows the same path as the Nishimori line:\n\nThis work shows not only that it is possible to create and manipulate the phase transition between order and long-range order on a quantum computer, but also demonstrates our ability to do so at scale, given that our largest experiment simulates up to 54 spins across 125 qubits. Our theory work indicates that this protocol could even scale up to 1,121 qubits using a larger device like the IBM Quantum Condor.\n\nHow a condensed-matter physics experiment reveals insights into the nature of quantum information\n\nAt its core, our simulation experiment is a powerful example of the impact quantum computers can make in condensed-matter physics research. This work is the first to show that we can manipulate the error in quantum hardware to transition a quantum system into and out of long-range order in a controlled way.\n\nGiven that our simulations concern the random bond Ising model\u2014an important model of magnetism\u2014this could have important implications for our understanding of real-world magnetic materials, revealing insights into how it is possible for them to maintain their magnetic effects despite the presence of imperfections in their atomic structure.\n\nMagnetism is an important field in physics because magnets are pervasive in technology. We use them in smartphones, hard drives, and MRI medical scans\u2014to name just a few examples\u2014and a better understanding of magnetism is essential for progress in the semiconductor processing that we use to create computer chips.\n\nHowever, this work may also have more fundamental relevance for our understanding of quantum information. In the early 2000s, theorists from Caltech drew a profound connection between the random bond Ising model and quantum error correcting codes. At the time, the question of whether practical quantum error correction could ever be achieved was much more controversial than it is today.\n\nBy mapping quantum errors to spins and their interactions in the random bond Ising model, the Caltech researchers rigorously proved that small amounts of quantum errors are not detrimental to quantum information\u2014in the same way that low-enough levels of magnetic disorder do not immediately ruin long-range magnetic ordering. Through this connection, they established that quantum computers can indeed tolerate a certain amount of error.\n\nAnother interesting takeaway is the simple but perhaps counterintuitive fact that quantum information is not always exclusively quantum in nature; it can co-exist with classical information. In our experiments, we used a classical decoder to take information from the classically projected auxiliary qubits, and then used that classical information to recover quantum information that was previously hidden. This shows that, at least in some cases, we cannot process quantum information successfully without also processing classical information.\n\nThis goes against some of the basic intuitions we develop as students of quantum information science when we learn about fundamental concepts like the observer effect, which tells us that the act of observing or measuring a quantum state collapses the state\u2019s quantum information into classical information. We often see this concept illustrated via the famous Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat thought experiment, where a cat trapped in a box with a radioactive isotope exists in a superposition state of \u201calive\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d until an observer looks inside the box. The act of observation forces the state of the cat to settle into one of the two classical options.\n\nNature, however, is a bit more complicated. This research shows that, in the real world, when you have a quantum state and want to get a glimpse inside it, you can collapse part of that state through measurement, and use the classical information you collect from that measurement to learn something about the quantum information that has yet to be directly measured. These sorts of measurement-based protocols could play an important role towards the development of algorithms for studying condensed-matter phenomena using quantum processors.\n\nFor more details on this experiment, be sure to read the full paper in Nature Physics.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Trending on News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other AI stocks trending on news and analyst ratings.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a consortium led by Elon Musk said on Monday that it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Marc Toberoff, Musk\u2019s attorney, confirmed that he submitted the bid for all OpenAI\u2019s assets to its board.\n\nThe offer is a twist to Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s rift that began last August when Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI. The lawsuit accused the company of putting profits before its initial nonprofit mission which aimed to advance AI in a way that benefits humanity.\n\nThe two prominent figures of the tech world are still involved in a legal battle over the future of this AI startup.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI News Making Waves on Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nAnalysts have been skeptical of Musk\u2019s move ever since it came to light.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to be pretty suspicious of this considering that he has a competitor himself\u2026 which is structured as a for-profit company, so I think there\u2019s more than meets the eye here\u201d. \u2013 Christie Pitts, a tech investor in San Francisco, told the BBC.\n\nSam Altman has this to say about the bid:\n\nMusk was \u201ca competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna buy this\u2019 with total disregard for the mission\u201d. \u2013 Altman told Axios\n\nPlus, this is what Altman wrote on X as a reply to Musk\u2019s bid:\n\n\u201cNo thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\u201d\n\nOpenAI was cofounded by Musk and Altman in 2018 as a non-profit, with Musk leaving before the company took off. Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says that the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity. However, it was now focused on making money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.\u201d -Elon Musk\n\nOn the contrary, Altman said that he has no interest in the offer, stating that OpenAI is not for sale.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company and a pioneer in artificial intelligence, offering AI consulting services and a suite of AI software products. On February 11, Oppenheimer initiated coverage of the stock with an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and a $320 price target. The firm said it sees \u201csustained \u2018double-digit\u2019 revenue growth\u201d for IBM.\n\n\u201cWe are initiating coverage of International Business Machines (IBM) with an Outperform rating and a $320 price target\u201d.\n\nOppenheimer is bullish on the stock as it anticipates strong revenue growth in its software business, primarily driven by its Red Hat offerings. It also anticipates a rebound in consulting in the second half of 2025 with recovery in application development and management. IBM also enjoys \u201coptionality\u201d with the creation and management of artificial intelligence applications. Therefore, the analyst told investors in a research note that these drivers are likely to lead to \u201cstrong expansion activity\u201d with existing customers, as well as boost continued gross and pre-tax margin expansion.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 9th on our list of AI stocks trending on news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Yury Uskov iSpring\u2019s VKontakte page\n\nOn Monday, Russian police raided iSpring, a software company that lists major Russian corporations and international firms like Sony, Samsung, and IBM among its clients, and arrested its founder, Yury Uskov, reportedly as part of a fraud investigation. Uskov claims the case is retaliation for his activism against a real estate project in a local park. But despite iSpring\u2019s alleged ties to \u201cunfriendly\u201d Western companies, it\u2019s Russian politicians and pro-war bloggers who are rallying to his defense. The reason? Uskov is a vocal supporter of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the case.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Russian law enforcement searched the office of iSpring, a software company based in the city of Yoshkar-Ola. The company confirmed the raids in a statement on its official Telegram channel. Founder Yury Uskov later revealed that officers had also searched his home. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll lock me up,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a Forbes Russia source at iSpring, Uskov was questioned and is being held for 48 hours. The source said the searches were linked to a large-scale fraud case, though officials have yet to confirm this.\n\nUskov suggested the investigation stemmed from alleged violations in the purchase of land for a planned corporate housing project, an issue reportedly flagged by law enforcement. As part of the same case, authorities also arrested Alexander Plotnikov, head of the Orshansky district administration in the Mari El Republic, and his first deputy, Kommersant reported.\n\nFounded in 2001 as CPS Labs, iSpring specializes in corporate e-learning software. Its two flagship products are iSpring Learn, a training platform, and iSpring Suite, an online course builder integrated with Microsoft PowerPoint. Both are listed in Russia\u2019s domestic software registry.\n\nWestern software\n\nStill loading... Despite Putin\u2019s ban, Russian state companies keep buying Western software as domestic alternatives fall short\n\nWestern software\n\nStill loading... Despite Putin\u2019s ban, Russian state companies keep buying Western software as domestic alternatives fall short\n\nThe client list published on the company website includes major Russian corporations such as Sberbank, Lukoil, and MTS, as well as international firms like Sony, Samsung, and IBM. In 2016, Forbes Russia reported that iSpring had also worked with the U.S. Department of Defense. In a December 2024 interview with the publication, Uskov claimed iSpring was Russia\u2019s leading provider of corporate training software and ranked among the world\u2019s top ten in the sector. He also noted that 70 percent of the company\u2019s revenue came from international clients.\n\nIn 2013, iSpring purchased a plot of land in the Orshansky district through an open auction, intending to build a residential community. By 2019, the company had constructed seven houses for programmers and a multi-story building on the site, RBC reported. Investigators now claim the land was acquired at an artificially low price, estimating the financial damage to the state at around 20.5 million rubles (approximately $218,000).\n\nYury Uskov\u2019s brother, Vladimir Uskov, confirmed these allegations in a comment to RIA Novosti but insisted the transaction was legal and that iSpring had actually paid above market value. He also pointed to a 2024 prosecutor\u2019s review of the deal, which he said found no violations.\n\nMeduza has condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine from the very start, and we are committed to reporting objectively on a war we firmly oppose. Join Meduza in its mission to challenge the Kremlin\u2019s censorship with the truth. Donate today.\n\nUskov, for his part, claimed the searches and his arrest are politically motivated. He argued that the case is retaliation for his activism against a planned residential development near a wooded area in Yoshkar-Ola.\n\n\u201cThe residents contacted the Construction Ministry and received confirmation that residential development in a recreational zone was illegal. Information about the violations was forwarded to the prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d Business Online quoted iSpring\u2019s press service as saying. The company also pointed out that criminal proceedings were launched on the same day a court was scheduled to hear arguments about the proposed construction.\n\nUskov\u2019s arrest has sparked outrage among his business partners and acquaintances. \u201cYury is undoubtedly one of the best in the industry. He has done more than most to improve education in this country. His arrest is yet another example of lawlessness and injustice,\u201d former Skyeng managing partner Alexander Laryanovskiy wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is not normal \u2014 though it has become routine in today\u2019s Russia.\u201d\n\nThe case has also drawn the attention of Russian politicians. Vladislav Davankov, deputy speaker of the State Duma and a former New People party presidential candidate, said he had asked Federal Investigative Committee head Alexander Bastrykin to take personal control of the investigation.\n\n\u201cIn a region where some homes are still heated with firewood, he built iSpring from the ground up \u2014 one of Russia\u2019s leading IT companies,\u201d Davankov wrote on Telegram. \u201cIn Yoshkar-Ola, few people believe that Yury could have stolen anything. Here, he\u2019s seen as a patriot who invests in his hometown rather than trying to exploit it.\u201d\n\nOn February 11, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin ordered Vasily Piskaryov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on safety and anti-corruption, to look into the circumstances of Uskov\u2019s arrest, RBC reported. The request came from Alexey Nechayev, leader of the New People party.\n\nUpdate: On February 12, Russian journalist Roman Yuneman reported that Yury Uskov had been released under pre-trial restrictions prohibiting him from communicating with anybody except for the authorities and emergency services.\n\nSome pro-war Z-bloggers, including Yegor Kholmogorov, have also voiced support for Uskov \u2014 likely due to his backing of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Davankov confirmed that Uskov has been an active supporter of the war effort.\n\n\u201cYury truly cares about this country,\u201d the deputy speaker said. \u201cWhen the \u2018 \u2019 began, he didn\u2019t try to shield his son from the draft \u2014 his son is fighting on the front lines, has been wounded, and Yury spends millions [of rubles] every month to support the troops.\u201d\n\nproblems in the IT sector\n\nRussia\u2019s Sberbank is laying off IT specialists from its subsidiaries en masse\n\nproblems in the IT sector",

            "content": "IBM and C40 Cities today announced a new collaboration through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator aimed at scaling up social innovation action in cities around the world.\n\nIn alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, the new project will develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to advance city resiliency and address specific challenges facing urban communities.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, IBM held a request for proposals for nonprofit and government organisations, focused on technology-driven projects to advance city resiliency. Out of more than 100 applicants, C40 Cities was one of five organisations selected to participate in this new cohort of IBM Sustainability Accelerator projects.\n\nParticipants were selected for their significant level of support to the communities they serve, as well as the innovative ways each organisation plans to leverage AI technology to build more resilient cities. Each organisation will receive up to $3 million in cash and in-kind donations of technology and services.\n\nIBM and C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world\u2019s leading cities, will work together to create a data-driven, AI-powered solution to help cities analyse potential risks that may arise as a result of extreme heat and the urban heat island effect. These can include stressed energy resources, increases in mortality rates, and socioeconomic disparities. The new solution will aim to enable cities to create adaptation strategies to help alleviate population health risks and economic burdens, while strengthening national resilience efforts. The Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and the Group on Earth Observations will also support this project.\n\nMark Watts, Executive Director of C40 Cities said: \u201cCities are on the frontline of an extreme heat crisis. Through this collaboration with IBM\u2019s Sustainability Accelerator, we have a groundbreaking opportunity to harness AI-driven solutions to help cities analyse risks, strengthen resilience, and protect their most vulnerable communities. At C40, we are committed to ensuring mayors have the best data and tools available to make informed decisions and drive impactful climate action. We look forward to working with IBM to develop innovative strategies that will help cities worldwide adapt to rising temperatures and build a more sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe IBM Sustainability Accelerator is a social innovation program that applies IBM technologies, such as hybrid cloud and AI, and an ecosystem of experts to enhance and scale nonprofit and government organisation initiatives, accelerating economic impact for communities vulnerable to climate stress.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to unlock a new economic and innovation era for communities worldwide, helping people tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. We believe that much of this potential to improve people\u2019s lives resides in transforming cities, and this is what we are aiming to do with our AI technology and expertise,\u201d said Justina Nixon-Saintil, IBM Vice President and Chief Impact Officer.\n\nIBM and C40 Cities will collaborate over two years and in two phases. The first phase will begin with the IBM Garage, IBM\u2019s proven methodology for accelerating digital transformation and delivering meaningful, measurable, outcomes. Next, during the Development and Implementation phase, IBM experts will configure IBM resources and technology to help participants meet their goals, as well as support pilot deployments in communities and facilitate further scaling.\n\nTo date, 20 organisations have been part of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator supporting vulnerable populations around the world. As of last year, IBM has supported approximately 65,300 direct beneficiaries through our sustainable agriculture cohort, with approximately 1.1 million more projected to benefit from our clean energy cohort. And, we expect these resilient cities projects will benefit thousands of citizens across the world.\n\n\n\nShare article twitter\n\nlinkedin\n\nfacebook\n\nemail",

In this interview with UC Berkeley Haas professors Jenny Chatman and Sameer Srivastava, she shares how IBM\u2019s bold shift to AI-powered HR helped free up her human team to better support the company\u2019s 275,000 global employees.\n\nIBM\u2019s digital AI agent now handles 11 million interactions annually with a 94% resolution rate, and employee satisfaction has soared. LaMoreaux makes the case that this digital transformation has enabled her team to focus on high-value work like leadership coaching and complex problem-solving. She discusses how domain expertise has become more important than ever.\n\n3 main takeaways from Jenny & Sameer\u2019s interview with Nickle LaMoreaux:\n\nHR should lead by example before asking others to change. Leaders create a lot more credibility by transforming their own function first. Be intentional about AI adoption: What works for another company might not fit your culture or business needs. Focus on solving real problems rather than following trends. HR is uniquely positioned to guide organizations through AI integration, balancing business goals with employee readiness. It\u2019s critical for HR to make sure employees are prepared while maintaining cultural values.\n\n*The Culture Kit with Jenny & Sameer is a production of Haas School of Business and is produced by University FM.*\n\nShow Links:\n\nFull Transcript:\n\n[00:00:00] Sameer Srivastava: Welcome to The Culture Kit with Jenny and Sameer, where we give you the tools to build a healthy and effective workplace culture. I\u2019m Sameer Srivastava.\n\n[00:00:14] Jennifer Chatman: And I\u2019m Jenny Chatman. We\u2019re professors at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business and co-founders of the Berkeley Center for Workplace Culture and Innovation.\n\nOn today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll hear from Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer, on how HR leaders can use AI as a tool to improve workplace culture.\n\n[00:00:40] Nickle LaMoreaux: There\u2019s a high degree of trust in our culture around technology. That being said, we are also very clear that AI is never a decision-maker.\n\n[00:00:53] Sameer Srivastava: Today, we\u2019re thrilled to welcome Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, who leads people strategy, employee experience, and a global HR team that supports more than 275,000 IBM employees across 170 countries. So, not a big job at all. Welcome to the Culture Kit, Nickle.\n\n[00:01:16] Nickle LaMoreaux: Sameer, Jenny, it\u2019s wonderful to be with you today.\n\n[00:01:20] Jennifer Chatman: Well, Nickle, we saw you a year ago at our 2024 Culture Connect Conference, where you gave a really interesting talk \u2014 I would say you brought the house down \u2014 about the transformation of HR practices at IBM that you\u2019ve been leading. I know you\u2019ve been in your role as Chief Human Resources Officer since 2020, but you have more than 20 years at IBM. Have you ever experienced a period of such rapid change?\n\n[00:01:47] Nickle LaMoreaux: Jenny, no, I have not. I think, as human resources professionals, we thought 2020, with the pandemic, maybe going into 2021, was really going to be the height of needing to be agile and nimble. But I\u2019ve got to be honest, I think AI takes the cake when it comes to that now, just because of that rapid pace of change, but also because no two companies are going to be the same on this.\n\n[00:02:19] Sameer Srivastava: So, I want to dive into what\u2019s happening today, but I also want to start by going back in time. And IBM, as we\u2019ve talked about before, Nickle, has a special place in my heart because my father spent his entire 30-year career working at IBM. And I know from my own experience, talking to him, that IBM has just been a pioneer in so many different domains over the years. And you mentioned in your own talk that, back in even 2009, IBM began using neural networks for salary decisions. Could you walk us through a little bit of the history of the HR journey with AI at IBM?\n\n[00:02:53] Nickle LaMoreaux: Sure. And so, Sameer, what we say at IBM is, once an IBMer, always an IBMer. So, you are an extended part of the IBM family, and happy to have your father as an alumni. Yeah, if I think about the AI journey that we\u2019ve been on, we did start experimenting this, you know, 2008. 2009. We used neural networks at the time. So, you know, very different than where we are now with generative AI.\n\nBut what we were trying to achieve at that point in time was decision-making support for our management population. I think we all know that managers have the hardest jobs in our companies, no matter what industry you\u2019re in or how big or small you are. And so, as an HR team, what we were trying to do, to say, given all this information that is being thrown at them, how can we help make it easier for them?\n\nWe started with compensation. Every manager gets their annual salary budget, and you have to think about, how do you allocate it? So, were there AI tools that could assist in that allocation to start giving you a recommended way to spend the budget? As a manager, you always had autonomy to tweak it, but it gave you a starting point, taking in a lot of information, from performance to skills to benchmarking of that job. And so, that\u2019s where we started.\n\n[00:04:22] Jennifer Chatman: That\u2019s so interesting. And I\u2019m wondering a little bit more about the process. Like, when did you launch the first HR chatbot? How did it go over? Did people resist? What did you learn?\n\n[00:04:33] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah. You know, our first entry into this was what I\u2019ll call advanced predictive analytics. I\u2019m not even sure we were really calling it AI at that time. But at the point in time that AI became very visible to the rest of the function was through our very first chatbot.\n\nIn 2017, we launched an HR chatbot. And the real intent of it was to just be a question-and-answer tool for managers and employees on some of the most basic questions that HR professionals often got. But we learned maybe a lesson in AI that was powerful then. And I still think it\u2019s powerful today. We launched the chatbot. The technology was pretty amazing, but technology aside doesn\u2019t necessarily get an organization where it needs to go. What we found was no one used the chatbot. And so, why did no one use the chatbot? Because behavior change is a really important part of every company\u2019s AI journey. At the time, we still had a telephone number for HR. We still had an email address for HR. We still had HR professionals at all of our locations where people could walk down the hall and ask them a question.\n\n[00:06:01] Jennifer Chatman: So, maybe you could just say a little bit about how you broke through that, kind of, stalemate.\n\n[00:06:07] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah. So, break through it, we did. And I will tell you, we took an approach that was pretty bold. I\u2019m not necessarily sure it\u2019s an approach you would need to take today.\n\nIf we were really going to change behavior, we had to make a hard pivot. So, in 2018, overnight, we took away the email address to HR, we took away the telephone number to HR, and we told 21,000 first-line managers in about 90 countries at the time that we were becoming a digital-first HR function. And so, to get answers to their questions or support from HR, their only entry point was what we had then named it Ask HR, which was a digital chatbot.\n\nThat chatbot really could do two things at that time in 2018. It could answer basic questions or it could create a ticket if it couldn\u2019t answer your question. You can imagine this was a pretty bold approach to take. And maybe I should just say a minute about why, because Jenny and Sameer, I think this is where when we had talked last year, people often asked, how did you get to that point to really, kind of, take that bold leap? And it was because we were facing three things in the organization. The first thing is, like many HR departments, we were under what I\u2019ll call cost pressure. Our budget was not growing. In some years, it was shrinking or staying flat. But we were being asked to do more with less. The second thing that was happening is the complexity of the environment we were operating in was increasing. States, cities, providences, countries were all passing different laws. And typically, as an HR team, when you have that complexity, where you have to do different policies, different processes, you either put more people on it or you put technology on it. But that requires that you have money to do that, which we didn\u2019t have because of the first force that was hitting us. And the last piece I would say is, back in 2018, and, you know, if we could all go back in time a little bit, that is when we all started having these amazing consumer-grade experiences in our personal lives. One click to order something or to order a taxi, food, shopping, all on your mobile device and your handheld device.\n\nEmployees were coming into IBM and either we had no technology \u2014 and so, we were still doing things, hard copy, paper, pen, wet signatures \u2014 or even where we had technology, it didn\u2019t feel seamless, one-click. So, we took this bold approach to change behavior, but also because we saw a little bit of an unsolvable problem, this wasn\u2019t just about cutting out a little bit more and asking people to work harder. We needed a way to work smarter.\n\n[00:09:27] Sameer Srivastava: So, I wanted to think a little bit about the relationship between technology and automation on one hand and the human culture that IBM had developed and has evolved over all these years. Could you talk a little bit about how you see the introduction and rollout of AI tools and the automation of some of these core processes as possibly affecting or changing the culture of your organization?\n\n[00:09:50] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah, I think, you know, in this environment we\u2019re in now, the technology\u2019s pretty amazing. And many of us are experimenting. But the first piece of advice I give any company when they\u2019re embarking on this, particularly, as you think about it in your people or talent processes, is be intentional about where you use it. And you need to be intentional to make sure that it supports your business model, how your company or organization, why it exists. You need to be intentional to ensure that it\u2019s actually solving the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, but that it also fits your culture. And so, where you get started with AI, you need to be taking all of this into account.\n\nOne of the things I worry about a little bit is, that because there are so many great use cases out there for AI right now, including the digital assistant I just spoke about, a lot of companies are in the FOMO stage. And so, they\u2019re just saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be left behind. I hear that this other company is doing this with AI. Let me just quickly replicate it.\u201d But if it doesn\u2019t support your business model, and if it doesn\u2019t solve a problem, and if it doesn\u2019t fit your culture, then you\u2019re going to find that you\u2019re not getting the lift from it as appropriate.\n\nAnd so, you know, Sameer, even if I think about what we\u2019ve done, because we are a technology company, one of the reasons why we can go digital-first is because that\u2019s embedded in the culture of our company, the business processes that we have. There\u2019s a high degree of trust in our culture around technology. That being said, we are also very clear that AI is never a decision-maker. And so, even in the examples where I talked about the recommendations around your salary budget, that always has a human in the loop, because in our culture, it\u2019s very important to have humans be decision-makers.\n\nThe last point on this, and this gets to the what\u2019s important for you and I to interact on, everything we\u2019re doing around AI and automation in HR is trying to make sure that the low-value work is being done as quickly as possible and as accurately as possible. If you need to update your address, I don\u2019t want you to necessarily have to talk to me to go do that. Even in a self-service model where you may log into a tool, I don\u2019t want you to have to remember your password, fill it out, and then make sure you submit it. I\u2019d rather to have you tell a digital assistant, \u201cI\u2019ve moved, here\u2019s my new address,\u201d and it, in an automated way, does all of that for you.\n\nBut at the point, you need leadership coaching, you have a tough performance management situation, you want to build unique learning plans, given the aspiration of your team, I want you dealing with an HR professional on that \u2014 human to human, face to face. And so, in our culture, it\u2019s thinking through, where do you want that human value? And where is it okay not to have it?\n\n[00:13:25] Jennifer Chatman: So, this question is, kind of, a how\u2019s it going question. I\u2019m wondering if there are cultural metrics that have improved with the use of digital labor for these lower-level repetitive tasks, if people don\u2019t have to go through a big process to change their address, is there a, kind of, cultural benefit to that?\n\n[00:13:48] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah, if I take a snapshot of where we are now, because I started to tell you where we started in 2018, but if we did a fast forward to the end of 2024, our digital agent, we now call it an agent because it will answer your questions, but it will also do transactions and assist you with programmatic work, our digital agent, last year, handled 11 million interactions.\n\n[00:14:16] Jennifer Chatman: Wow.\n\n[00:14:19] Nickle LaMoreaux: It did almost 500,000 transactions, from updating your address, to transferring an employee, to creating a new job requisition that might need to be posted on an external job board. What we\u2019re finding is that the satisfaction net promoter score with that service is 74%.\n\n[00:14:43] Jennifer Chatman: Okay.\n\n[00:14:44] Nickle LaMoreaux: Okay. So, that\u2019s a pretty high satisfaction level. And what I will tell you, before we moved to this digital-first approach in 2018, we were actually at a satisfaction level of plus 19 NPS \u2014 so, a massive shift.\n\n[00:15:02] Jennifer Chatman: Yeah.\n\n[00:15:02] Nickle LaMoreaux: The other thing I\u2019m proud to say is that the digital assistant itself has a 94% containment rate. What does that mean? Of those transactions coming in, the questions coming in, how many is it able to handle without having to go to a human tier? That leads to that high satisfaction rate, because when you do need an expert, Nickle isn\u2019t bogged down with looking up the vacation policy. You can get to an expert quickly. And for my HR team, HR engagement is at an all-time high and the average band or grade, we use bands at IBM, but levels, if you think about it this way, has increased by two. So, we really are moving to that higher-value work. And it\u2019s really adding a lot of benefit to the business.\n\n[00:15:58] Sameer Srivastava: So, can you say a little bit more about that? In particular, the types of skills that are now needed in the HR professional that, perhaps, were less critical before? How is this changing the expertise you\u2019re even looking for in the function?\n\n[00:16:11] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah. So, if I think about the expertise, you know, a lot of people have often asked me, in this age of AI where you can ask an agent any kind of question, is domain expertise fading? And I would actually say domain expertise is becoming more and more important, because the basic questions are being able to be answered by an agent. But when you get to the complex scenarios and you get to that expert, you need to be able to go very, very deep. So, I always say to my HR professionals, domain expertise have become more important than ever, and especially for HR professionals. I say you have to be an expert in at least one thing. It can be compensation, it could be benefits, it could be leadership development, but you\u2019ve got to have a domain expertise focus.\n\nThe second thing that has become even more important is business acumen. Because again, you have to be able to overlay that domain expertise over the business problem or the business model. At IBM, we\u2019re a hardware, software, and consulting company. So, if you have a retention situation that has come into you as an expert, you have to think about it. How do I solve it in the context of those businesses? So, that\u2019s a second very important key skill.\n\nThe third thing I say is, AI itself isn\u2019t necessarily a job. It\u2019s a skill we\u2019ve all got to have to have in our responsibilities. We have to know how to work with AI. And so, for my HR professionals, they have to understand, how do you update the Q\u2019s and A\u2019s coming in? How do you watch where we might be seeing hallucinations? All of that is something that we\u2019ve got to be able to respond to real time. And it\u2019s not one person\u2019s job. It\u2019s all of us, as we\u2019re working with the AI.\n\n[00:18:16] Jennifer Chatman: So, Nickle, you wrote in a LinkedIn article that, and I\u2019ll use quotes here, \u201cagentic AI is going to be the talk of 2025.\u201d I\u2019m interested in, kind of, what you meant by that. And specifically, you use the term, \u201cagentic.\u201d So, contrasting agentic and generative AI, what does that mean to you?\n\n[00:18:39] Nickle LaMoreaux: Yeah, absolutely. I will tell you that a lot of the advancements that we made in HR, in our assistant, were traditional AI. We spend a lot of time training, Q&A, and then using natural language. The assistant would answer the questions. We are now moving to generative AI. And the beauty of generative AI is it takes a lot less time to train. It is a lot more user-friendly. It can understand a lot more context. It also has what I call memory.\n\no, as we move to generative AI, the really great thing is that it is going to have a much higher, easier, better user experience around question and answer functionality. It will also, through other technology, be able to do transactions that I spoke about.\n\nWe also will have to watch for hallucinations. In IBM\u2019s terminology, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re using generative AI, but there are some questions where there\u2019s only one right answer. And in those, we are doing the more traditional AI with hard coded answers.\n\nWe are, though, moving to agentic. What does agentic mean? You get all of the functionality of that Q&A and that transactions but you can now run full programs. An example at IBM is, if I\u2019m a compensation professional and I log in to Ask HR, I can ask questions. What\u2019s the vacation policy? I can then ask it to do a task for me. I can say, \u201cPlease put in for time off from February 1st to February 10th.\u201d But then I can also say, \u201cI\u2019d like to initiate the promotion cycle for the software division.\u201d And that agentic AI will come back to me and it will know I\u2019m authorized because I\u2019m a compensation professional to initiate the promotion process. It will say, \u201cThere are 6,000 managers in the software division. Would you like to send an email to all of them initiating the process?\u201d I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo, please exclude these two countries because we\u2019re still in works council negotiations.\u201d So, it will exclude those two countries. It will say, \u201cWhat is the criteria for this year\u2019s promotion cycle?\u201d I can upload a document. It will read it. And it will say, \u201cHere\u2019s the draft email we\u2019re going to send to the specified managers,\u201d and it will send it for you. That is agentic AI, where it\u2019s able to do not just one task, but it is able to do, kind of, these multi-programmatic steps to make your work easier.\n\n[00:21:37] Sameer Srivastava: It\u2019s great to have a very concrete example like that, but I want to ask you now to extrapolate a bit beyond even IBM to think about the entire labor force. And in this year\u2019s Culture Connect Conference, we had a couple of really fascinating talks by some labor economists who are trying to look at the effect of AI on the overall workforce. And you yourself have estimated that, like, 95% of existing jobs are going to change in some form through AI, generative AI and agentic AI altogether. If you were to speculate a little bit about how that transformation will play out, what are some of your early thoughts?\n\n[00:22:11] Nickle LaMoreaux: My early thoughts around this are that, probably, for the next several years, maybe even close to a decade, this, really, is not about new jobs being created or jobs going completely away. It is about all of our jobs that exist today, even yours and Jenny\u2019s, mine as well, it is about our jobs changing. And that\u2019s what I think we need to be focused on.\n\nI know, early last year in the AI journeys, many people were forecasting, well, prompt engineers will be a job. Here\u2019s how I think about AI. AI is a platform. It\u2019s a platform like the internet, like email. And so, if you think about that, the internet, email has transformed how we all do our jobs, but it\u2019s not a job itself. You know, even prompt engineer, I often joked that, it\u2019s, kind of, like, comparable to saying, \u201cWell, you\u2019re going to be an email drafter.\u201d We all have to be prompt engineers, just like we all have to write our own emails, right?\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s what I think, again, over a much longer arc, and maybe some of those labor economists you talk about, will there be jobs that maybe completely we don\u2019t need as many of and others that we need far more of? Yes. But in this period we\u2019re in now, the biggest advice I can give people is, don\u2019t worry about, like, what job\u2019s coming, what job\u2019s going. Think about what skills you\u2019re building. How are you, or how would you recommend to your boss, to your company, of where agentic AI could be helpful in your job? If you can get ahead of that and move with it, you\u2019re going to find that you\u2019re in a much better place.\n\n[00:24:08] Jennifer Chatman: Well, you raise a good point. I think Sameer and I are acutely aware that we\u2019re in the mix as professors, too, and potentially very replaceable, I suppose. Nickle, this has been such an interesting conversation. We always like to end with three key takeaways. And I\u2019m wondering if you could think about how HR leaders can prepare their organizations for this scale of change.\n\n[00:24:32] Nickle LaMoreaux: So, the first piece of advice I would give for HR leaders is lead the change yourself. You become a lot more credible in your organization if you are also doing it within the HR function. So, that would be the first thing I would say.\n\nThe second thing I would say is this point about being intentional. There\u2019s a lot of really interesting great stuff going on that is fit for purpose for other companies. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fit for purpose for you. And, you know, just as we think about this podcast, not only think about, does the technology work, and does it solve the business problem? But you need to be very intentional about, does it fit the culture of your company? So, that would be the second piece I would say.\n\nAnd the third piece that I would say is, because of this point that AI is going to change every job, I feel that HR professionals are in a unique position and, maybe, the only position to really lead this effort within their company. Because if you think about it, we\u2019re all in organizations where business leaders will want to go, you know, totally without abandon, jump head, feet first, head first into AI, but you\u2019ve got to be thoughtful about, how are you building skills? How are you preparing the workforce?\n\nYou may have other functions, maybe legal, that are saying, \u201cOh, let\u2019s be a little cautious.\u201d You may have the IT department saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if we can afford it.\u201d HR needs to be the one that puts all of those distinct pieces together to think about, well, where is the return on that technology, and why should we push forward? Where should we take the risk and why shouldn\u2019t we take the risk? But most importantly, how do we bring the employees along with us? So, again, lead, lead, lead. I think HR professionals are uniquely positioned for this.\n\n[00:26:31] Jennifer Chatman: What an opportunity. Thank you so much, Nickle. This has been fantastic.\n\n[00:26:35] Sameer Srivastava: Thank you, Nickle. That was great.\n\n[00:26:37] Nickle LaMoreaux: Wonderful to be here, Jenny and Sameer.\n\n[00:26:42] Jennifer Chatman: Thanks for listening to The Culture Kit with Jenny and Sameer.

            "content": "Have you assessed how the international operations of IBM (IBM) performed in the quarter ended December 2024? For this technology and consulting company, possessing an expansive global footprint, parsing the trends of international revenues could be critical to gauge its financial resilience and growth prospects.\n\nThe global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\n\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\n\nUpon examining IBM's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $17.55 billion, showing rise of 1%. We will now explore the breakdown of IBM's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n\nA Look into IBM's International Revenue Streams\n\nDuring the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $3.2 billion in revenue, making up 18.23% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $3.44 billion, this meant a surprise of -6.86%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $2.9 billion, or 19.37%, in the previous quarter, and $3.2 billion, or 18.41%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOf the total revenue, $5.8 billion came from Europe, Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 33.04%. This represented a surprise of +8.83% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $5.33 billion to the total revenue.

            "content": "AI computing has a reputation for consuming epic quantities of energy. This is partly because of the sheer volume of data being handled. Training often requires billions or trillions of pieces of information to create a model with billions of parameters. But that\u2019s not the whole reason \u2014 it also comes down to how most computer chips are built.\n\nModern computer processors are quite efficient at performing the discrete computations they\u2019re usually tasked with. Though their efficiency nosedives when they must wait for data to move back and forth between memory and compute, they\u2019re designed to quickly switch over to work on some unrelated task. But for AI computing, almost all the tasks are interrelated, so there often isn\u2019t much other work that can be done when the processor gets stuck waiting, said IBM Research scientist Geoffrey Burr.\n\nIn that scenario, processors hit what is called the von Neumann bottleneck, the lag that happens when data moves slower than computation. It\u2019s the result of von Neumann architecture, found in almost every processor over the last six decades, wherein a processor\u2019s memory and computing units are separate, connected by a bus. This setup has advantages, including flexibility, adaptability to varying workloads, and the ability to easily scale systems and upgrade components. That makes this architecture great for conventional computing, and it won\u2019t be going away any time soon.\n\nBut for AI computing, whose operations are simple, numerous, and highly predictable, a conventional processor ends up working below its full capacity while it waits for model weights to be shuttled back and forth from memory. Scientists and engineers at IBM Research are working on new processors, like the AIU family, which use various strategies to break down the von Neumann bottleneck and supercharge AI computing.\n\nWhy does the von Neumann bottleneck exist?\n\nThe von Neumann bottleneck is named for mathematician and physicist John von Neumann, who first circulated a draft of his idea for a stored-program computer in 1945. In that paper, he described a computer with a processing unit, a control unit, memory that stored data and instructions, external storage, and input/output mechanisms. His description didn\u2019t name any specific hardware \u2014 likely to avoid security clearance issues with the US Army, for whom he was consulting. Almost no scientific discovery is made by one individual, though, and von Neumann architecture is no exception. Von Neumann\u2019s work was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who invented the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the world\u2019s first digital computer. In the time since that paper was written, von Neumann architecture has become the norm.\n\n\u201cThe von Neumann architecture is quite flexible, that\u2019s the main benefit,\u201d said IBM Research scientist Manuel Le Gallo-Bourdeau. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was first adopted, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s still the prominent architecture today.\u201d\n\nDiscrete memory and computing units mean you can design them separately and configure them more or less any way you want. Historically, this has made it easier to design computing systems because the best components can be selected and paired, based on the application.\n\nEven the cache memory, which is integrated into a single chip with the processor, can still be individually upgraded. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are implications for the processor when you make a new cache memory design, but it\u2019s not as difficult as if they were coupled together,\u201d Le Gallo-Bourdeau said. \u201cThey\u2019re still separate. It allows some freedom in designing the cache separately from the processor.\u201d\n\nHow the von Neumann bottleneck reduces efficiency\n\nFor AI computing, the von Neumann bottleneck creates a twofold efficiency problem: the number of model parameters (or weights) to move, and how far they need to move. More model weights mean larger storage, which usually means more distant storage, said IBM Research scientist Hsinyu (Sidney) Tsai. \u201cBecause the quantity of model weights is very large, you can\u2019t afford to hold them for very long, so you need to keep discarding and reloading,\u201d she said.\n\nThe main energy expenditure during AI runtime is spent on data transfers \u2014 bringing model weights back and forth from memory to compute. By comparison, the energy spent doing computations is low. In deep learning models, for example, the operations are almost all relatively simple matrix vector multiplication problems. Compute energy is still around 10% of modern AI workloads, so it isn\u2019t negligible, said Tsai. \u201cIt is just found to be no longer dominating energy consumption and latency, unlike in conventional workloads,\u201d she added.\n\nAbout a decade ago, the von Neumann bottleneck wasn\u2019t a significant issue because processors and memory weren\u2019t so efficient, at least compared to the energy that was spent to transfer data, said Le Gallo-Bourdeau. But data transfer efficiency hasn\u2019t improved as much as processing and memory have over the years, so now processors can complete their computations much more quickly, leaving them sitting idle while data moves across the von Neumann bottleneck.\n\nThe farther away the memory is from the processor, the more energy it costs to move it. On a basic physical level, an electrical copper wire is charged to propagate a 1, and it\u2019s discharged to propagate a 0. The energy spent charging and discharging the wires is proportional to their length, so the longer the wire is, the more energy you spend. This also means greater latency, as it takes more time for the charge to dissipate or propagate the longer the wire is.\n\nAdmittedly, the time and energy cost of each data transfer is low, but every time you want to propagate data through a large language model, you need to load up to billions of weights from the memory. This could mean using the DRAM from one or more other GPUs, because one GPU doesn\u2019t have enough memory to store them all. After they\u2019re downloaded to the processor, it performs its computations and sends the result to another memory location for further processing.\n\nAside from eliminating the von Neumann bottleneck, one solution includes closing that distance. \u201cThe entire industry is working to try to improve data localization,\u201d Tsai said. IBM Research scientists recently announced such an approach: a polymer optical waveguide for co-packaged optics. This module brings the speed and bandwidth density of fiber optics to the edge of chips, supercharging their connectivity and hugely reducing model training time and energy costs.\n\nWith currently available hardware, though, the result of all these data transfers is that training an LLM can easily take months, consuming more energy than a typical US home does in that time. And AI doesn\u2019t stop needing energy after model training. Inferencing has similar computational requirements, meaning that the von Neumann bottleneck slows it down in a similar fashion.\n\na. In a conventional computing system, when an operation f is performed on data D, D has to be moved into a processing unit, leading to significant costs in latency and energy. b. In the case of in-memory computing, f(D) is performed within a computational memory unit by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices, thus obviating the need to move D to the processing unit. The computational tasks are performed within the confines of the memory array and its peripheral circuitry, albeit without deciphering the content of the individual memory elements. Both charge-based memory technologies, such as SRAM, DRAM, and flash memory, and resistance-based memory technologies, such as RRAM, PCM, and STT-MRAM, can serve as elements of such a computational memory unit. Source: Nature Nanotechnology\n\nGetting around the bottleneck\n\nFor the most parts, model weights are stationary, and AI computing is memory-centric, rather than compute heavy, said Le Gallo-Bourdeau. \u201cYou have a fixed set of synaptic weights, and you just need to propagate data through them.\u201d\n\nThis quality has enabled him and his colleagues to pursue analog in-memory computing, which integrates memory with processing, using the laws of physics to store weights. One of these approaches is phase-change memory (PCM), which stores model weights in the resistivity of a chalcogenide glass, which is changed by applying an electrical current.\n\n\u201cThis way we can reduce the energy that is spent in data transfers and mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck,\u201d said Le Gallo-Bourdeau. In-memory computing isn\u2019t the only way to work around the von Neumann bottleneck, though.\n\nThe AIU NorthPole is a processor that stores memory in digital SRAM, and while its memory isn\u2019t intertwined with compute in the same way as analog chips, its numerous cores each has access to local memory \u2014 making it an extreme example of near-memory computing. Experiments have already demonstrated the power and promise of this architecture. In recent inference tests run on a 3-billion-parameter LLM developed from IBM\u2019s Granite-8B-Code-Base model, NorthPole was 47 times faster than the next most energy-efficient GPU and was 73 times more energy efficient than the next lowest latency GPU.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that models trained on von Neumann hardware can be run on non-von Neumann devices. In fact, for analog in-memory computing, it\u2019s essential. PCM devices aren\u2019t durable enough to have their weights changed over and over, so they\u2019re used to deploy models that have been trained on conventional GPUs. Durability is a comparative advantage of SRAM memory in near-memory or in-memory computing, as it can be rewritten infinitely.\n\nWhy von Neumann computing isn\u2019t going away\n\nWhile von Neumann architecture creates a bottleneck for AI computing, for other applications, it\u2019s perfectly suited. Sure, it causes issues in model training and inference, but von Neumann architecture is perfect for processing computer graphics or other compute-heavy processes. And when 32- or 64-bit floating point precision is called for, the low precision of in-memory computing isn\u2019t up to the task.\n\n\u201cFor general purpose computing, there's really nothing more powerful than the von Neumann architecture,\u201d said Burr. Under these circumstances, bytes are either operations or operands that are moving on a bus from a memory to a processor. \u201cJust like an all-purpose deli where somebody might order some salami or pepperoni or this or that, but you're able to switch between them because you have the right ingredients on hand, and you can easily make six sandwiches in a row.\u201d Special-purpose computing, on the other hand, may involve 5,000 tuna sandwiches for one order \u2014 like AI computing as it shuttles static model weights.\n\nEven when building their in-memory AIU chips, IBM Researchers include some conventional hardware for the necessary high-precision operations.",

Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThis week's first dividend stock is tech giant IBM (IBM). The company impressed investors with its market-beating fourth-quarter earnings. Notably, IBM's Software segment's performance reflected solid demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and the Red Hat Linux operating system.\n\nThe company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends in the fourth quarter. IBM has a dividend yield of 2.6%.\n\nIn reaction to the results, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani raised the price target for IBM stock to $275 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. The analyst highlighted that the Q4 revenue growth was driven by continued acceleration in IBM's Software business growth, which helped offset the weakness in the Consulting and Infrastructure segments.\n\n\"We think the print highlighted IBM's unique position across both Software and Consulting segments that are starting to inflect higher with AI and potential M&A being incremental upside catalysts,\" said Daryanani.\n\nThe analyst noted that despite flattish trends in the fourth quarter, the company expects the Consulting segment's performance to improve in 2025, driven by higher IT spending and the conversion of the $5 billion of AI signings to revenues.\n\nDaryanani further added that during the December quarter, IBM's shareholder returns comprised only dividends and no share repurchases. He highlighted that the company is committed to a consistent and growing dividend. He expects IBM to allocate more capital to mergers and acquisitions rather than share repurchases.\n\nDaryanani ranks No. 244 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 14%. See IBM Stock Charts on TipRanks.\n\nVerizon\n\nThe next dividend pick is telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ). The company posted strong results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and achieved the best quarterly postpaid phone gross additions in five years. On Feb. 3, Verizon paid a quarterly dividend of just over 67 cents per share. VZ stock offers a dividend yield of 6.8%.\n\nRecently, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on Verizon stock with a price target of $55. The analyst highlighted that a reacceleration in mobile and broadband subscriber growth is fueling the company's revenue and cash flow.\n\nFeinseth thinks that Verizon will continue to gain from robust 5G adoption and increasing services revenue growth. He also thinks that the company is well-positioned to benefit from AI-led growth in mobile edge computing. The analyst noted that Verizon has a solid track record of developing and integrating AI enhancements across its network and is in the process of integrating several generative AI initiatives.\n\n\"5G and margin expansion combined with AI-driven network optimization and operating efficiency expansion is driving a re-acceleration in Business Performance trends,\" said Feinseth.\n\nThe analyst also expects Verizon's expansion into emerging technologies, like autonomous vehicle connectivity, smart city infrastructure and remote health-care solutions, to drive further growth. Moreover, Feinseth thinks that VZ's above-average dividend yield makes it a compelling pick. He pointed out that the company has hiked its dividend every year for the past 18 years.\n\nFeinseth ranks No. 169 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 15%. See Verizon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.\n\nEPR Properties\n\nAnother attractive dividend stock is EPR Properties (EPR), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on experiential properties such as movie theaters, amusement parks, eat-and-play centers and ski resorts. EPR offers a dividend yield of 7.2%.\n\nAfter the company hosted a multi-city non-deal road show, RBC Capital analyst Michael Carroll reiterated a buy rating on EPR stock with a price target of $50. The analyst stated that management \"highlighted an attractive story supported by a healthy tenant base, recovering box office, and a pragmatic investment approach.\"\n\nCarroll noted that consumers have been resilient following the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to give importance to experiences, thus benefiting EPR due to its focus on experiential properties. Also, management noted that the mid- to high-end customers, who are its tenants' major clients, continue to be healthy and are visiting its properties.\n\nThe analyst added that EPR expects to gain from a rebound in box office in 2025. The company expects 110-115 wide releases by studios in 2025 and more than 120 in 2026, compared to only 95 in 2024.\n\nCarroll is also bullish on EPR stock due to its lucrative dividend yield of more than 7%, which it expects to grow at the rate of 3% to 5% per year. At a multiple of an estimated 9.0-times forward adjusted funds from operations, the analyst finds EPR's valuation attractive.\n\nCarroll ranks No. 886 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 7.5%. See EPR Properties Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Why Are These 10 Dividend Stocks Declining? In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other declining dividend stocks.\n\nThe dividend season is here, and the big announcements are rolling in!\n\nThe overall market atmosphere has been moderately negative since the new tariffs from the US. Soon after he entered the Oval Office, President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico. Chinese products, meanwhile, are left tackling an even higher tariff of 60 percent.\n\nAs a result, on Monday this week, the broader market noted a sharp decline of 0.76 percent, while the Nasdaq reported the same trajectory but at 1.20 percent.\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently shown interest in dividend stocks, particularly those from companies that have steadily increased their payouts, making them popular among income-focused investors. Analysts have long tracked the performance of Dividend Aristocrats, both historically and in recent times.\n\nIn a January 2019 blog post titled \u201cDividend Growth Strategies and Downside Protection,\u201d Phillip Brzenk, Global Head of Multi-Asset Indexes, examined how dividend growth strategies perform, especially during market downturns. He noted that since the end of 1989, there have been six calendar years where the broader market delivered negative returns. Interestingly, during each of those years, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader equity benchmark by an average margin of 13.28%. In addition, in three of those challenging years, they still managed to generate positive total returns. Brzenk further pointed out that when analyzed on a monthly basis, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the market 53% of the time, with an average outperformance of 0.16%.\n\nAs noted earlier, dividend growth stocks have outperformed the broader market. From its launch in 2005 through September 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered a total return of 10.35%, exceeding the broader market\u2019s 9.54% return over the same period. Moreover, these stocks experienced lower volatility, measured at 15.35%, compared to the market\u2019s 16.31%. This suggests that their prices tend to be more stable, making them less susceptible to sharp fluctuations and highlighting their overall resilience.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn the list of underwhelming performers we will be looking into today, the dividend companies with a minimum of $1 billion in market capitalization alone are considered. Then we checked the returns of these stocks and selected 10 stocks that fell on February 6, 2024. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as of February 6. We also hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 2.61%\n\nEx-Dividend Date: February 10, 2025\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nQuarterly dividend amount: $1.67\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has declined since the start of the market after reaching its 52-week high of $265.72 just a few trading sessions ago. The stock recently received new investment from Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. Ltd., increasing their holding to 10.6% per the SEC disclosure. IBM\u2019s stock has been of particular interest to multiple hedge funds such as FMR LLC (6.6%) and State Street Corp (2.2%). According to our database, 57 hedge funds held a strong position in the share by the end of Q3 2024.\n\nThe stock price declined despite Stiefel maintaining a buy rating with a $290 target as the stock is adjusting after a soaring high in the recent sessions, and it presents an ideal opportunity for investors to accumulate the stocks.\n\nOne of the trusted stocks among dividend investors, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) maintains a high dividend payout ratio of 102.6% and a progressive dividend policy with an average annual dividend growth rate of 0.7% over the last 5 years.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 9th on our list of declining dividend stocks. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nAt IBM's Investor Day event in New York City this week, the first the company has held since 2021, a word executives stressed was \"software.\"\n\nAnd two other words top IBM brass highlighted again and again were \"Red Hat.\"\n\n\"Hopefully you got the theme of the entire day today of us being a much more software-led company,\" IBM chief financial officer James Kavanaugh told the audience.\n\nNumbers tell the journey. IBM historically focused on business consulting and manufacturing hardware like servers, storage systems and network equipment. In 2005, software accounted for 18% of the company's revenue. By 2019, the year IBM acquired the Raleigh software giant Red Hat for $34 billion, software was still only a quarter of its total revenue.\n\nIn the past six years however, Red Hat has helped IBM overhaul its portfolio. Kavanaugh told investors Tuesday that software is now 45% of IBM\u2014with the segment projected to soon reach 50%.\n\n\"Software is taking the baton from consulting and becoming the key to IBM's revenue, profit and free cash flow growth over the next three years,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in an investor note Wednesday.\n\nListen to any recent IBM earnings call and the catalyst for this transition is easy to spot.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, IBM recorded 22 consecutive fiscal quarters of declining revenue growth as it struggled to move from traditional hardware\u2014with its one-time sales and fixed equipment costs\u2014toward cloud computing. Red Hat has provided a jolt. Of the 22 quarters since IBM bought Red Hat, the Raleigh company has grown by at least 10% in all but four of them.\n\n\"We continue to see momentum in Red Hat with fourth-quarter revenue growth of 17%, fueled by six consecutive quarters of double-digit bookings growth,\" Kavanaugh said during the company's Jan. 29 earnings call.\n\nSince the acquisition, Red Hat's annual revenue has almost doubled from $3.4 billion to more than $6.5 billion. IBM has in recent years reversed its overall declines, albeit with smaller increases, and its stock is currently near an all-time high.\n\nBeyond hard figures, Red Hat's addition has coincided with heightened excitement around the parent company. In its latest analyst report, the investment firm BMO Capital Markets said the strong attendance at this year's Investor Day \"reflects incremental interest in IBM compared to historical events.\"\n\nBoth IBM and Red Hat are major employers in the Triangle. The former has the seventh-largest workforce in Durham County, state records show, with offices in Research Triangle Park, while Red Hat\u2014headquartered in downtown Raleigh\u2014is a top-20 employer in Wake County.\n\nFounded in 1993, Red Hat is the world's top provider of open source software. The company uses an operating system called Linux, which anyone can access for free. What is sells are bespoke Linux-based packages that enable customers to run their businesses efficiently.\n\nRed Hat's flagship product is Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL. The company has also reported significant growth in its hybrid cloud platform OpenShift, which has ballooned from $100 million in annual sales to more than $1.4 billion today.\n\nOn last week's earnings call, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna highlighted the role Red Hat plays as the parent company pursues artificial intelligence. Krishna highlighted how Red Hat software is being paired with Neural Magic, a generative AI firm IBM bought last year.\n\nYet while AI represents potential, investors say the value Red Hat gives IBM is in its steady subscription-based returns.\n\nIn its latest analyst note, the investment firm Melius Research compared the Red Hat acquisition to buying an annuity\u2014an insurance company product that guarantees buyers regular income. Confident that IBM will continue collecting returns, as customer demand for enterprise Linux services appears stable, Melius gave the company a share target of $290\u2014a 12% increase from its current price.\n\n2025 The News & Observer.

In the latest news report, Reuters reported that South Korea\u2019s industry ministry temporarily blocked access to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek due to security concerns. The government urges caution on generative AI services, particularly calling out ministries and agencies about using AI services such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek at work.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nState-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power reported blocking the use of AI services including DeepSeek earlier this month. The defense ministry has done the same for its computers that are for military use, reported officials. Yonhap News Agency has further reported restricting access to DeepSeek in computers that connect to external networks. South Korea, however, isn\u2019t the only country that despises DeepSeek for its security vulnerabilities.\n\nBBC has also reported on the matter, stating that Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices and systems. The country is concerned over the security risk the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup poses. Its government further insisted that the ban comes not because the startup is Chinese, but because of the \"unacceptable risk\" it poses to national security. The move specifically requires government entities to \"prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications, and web services\", as well as remove any previously installed, on any government system or device. As a result, a wide range of workers won\u2019t be able to use DeepSeek in the country.\n\nSimilarly, the US Navy has also banned the use of DeepSeek, as reported by CNBC last week. The Navy reportedly said that DeepSeek\u2019s AI was not to be used \u201cin any capacity\u201d due to \u201cpotential security and ethical concerns associated with the model\u2019s origin and usage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek,\u201d The memo said it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that team members do not use DeepSeek\u2019s AI \u201cfor any work-related tasks or personal use.\u201d\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

            "content": "Until the mid-1970s, IT professionals viewed computer code as implicit in the operation of computer hardware and not unique intellectual property subject to copyright protection. Organizations programmed their own software, and code sharing was a common practice.\n\nThe Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works was established in 1974. It concluded that software code was a category of creative work suitable for copyright protection. This development fueled the growth of independent software publishing as an industry, with proprietary source code as the primary source of revenue. As personal computing brought applications to every corporate desk and many households, the market for software became intensely competitive. Software publishers also became increasingly alert to infringements of their property rights.\n\nA rebellion against the restrictions and limitations of proprietary software began in 1983. Programmer Richard Stallman chafed at the notion that users could not customize proprietary software however they saw fit to accomplish their work. Stallman felt that \u201csoftware should be free\u2014as in speech, not beer\u201d and he championed the notion of freely available software for customization.\n\nStallman founded the Free Software Foundation and would go on to drive the development of an open source alternative to the AT&T-owned Unix operating system, among other applications. He also innovated the first copyleft software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), which required anyone who enhanced his source code to likewise publish their edited version freely to all.\n\nEric S. Raymond\u2019s 1997 essay \u201cThe Cathedral and the Bazaar\u201d is another watershed in the free software movement. Raymond contrasted the closed, top-down approach typical of proprietary software development, where all development was handled by a core group (which he called The Cathedral), versus open, freely shared public development over the internet (The Bazaar). Shortly after, Netscape Corporation released their Mozilla browser code as open source, and the open source movement gained legitimacy.\n\nBecause many felt that Stallman\u2019s term \u201cfree software\u201d inaptly emphasized \u201cfree of cost\u201d as the principal value of the software, the term \u201copen source\u201d was adopted in 1999. The Open Source Initiative (OCI) was created to advocate for it; the organization also has established ground rules for the industry through the open source definition and hosts compliant open source licenses. Today, the terms free software, open source software, free and open source software and free or libre-open source software all refer to the same thing: software with source code available for public use and customization.",

It is not clear when IBM started recording revenues to reach this figure.\n\nThe revelation followed the release of the company\u2019s Q4 2024 results, which saw Big Blue exceed Wall Street expectations and post quarterly revenue of $17.6 billion, bringing the year\u2019s revenue to $62.8bn overall. However, IBM does not provide a breakdown of figures for its quantum business in earnings reports, meaning it\u2019s not possible to know just how much quarterly revenue the technology is driving for the company.\n\nIn Q3 2024, publicly traded quantum computing companies IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave posted combined revenues of less than $20 million. If you were to divide IBM\u2019s $1bn figure equally over 34 quarters \u2013 roughly the number of reporting quarters since the company launched its first quantum product \u2013 it would equal approximately $29.4m.\n\nDCD has contacted IBM to ask for more information about how the $1bn figure was reached.\n\nUpdate: In response, IBM directed DCD to its 2025 Investor Day presentation, during which Jay Gambetta, VP of quantum, IBM fellow, provided more detail about the company's current and forward-looking quantum strategy.\n\nThe presentation clarified that the reporting window relating to the $1bn figure was Q1 2017 - Q4 2024, making average quarterly quantum revenue ~$31.3m.\n\nHowever, while CNBC reported that IBM had booked $1bn of cumulative quantum business, the Investor Day presentation states: \"IBM Quantum is approaching $1 billion of signings since inception (Q1 2017).\"\n\nA brief history of IBM Quantum\n\nIBM launched its first quantum offering in May 2016, a five-qubit cloud-based quantum computing service that was known at the time as IBM Quantum Experience.\n\nThe following year, the company made an additional 16-qubit processor available on the platform, announcing in 2018 that there were more than 80,000 users of the IBM Quantum Experience, who have collectively run more than three million experiments.\n\nToday the company hosts around a dozen quantum computers at its own data centers in New York and Germany for its quantum cloud service.\n\nIn addition to its cloud-based quantum offerings, IBM\u2019s quantum portfolio also includes a commercial quantum computer dubbed IBM Quantum System One. Powered by a 127-qubit IBM Quantum \u2018Eagle\u2019 processor, the system is kept at an operating temperature of 0.015 Kelvin to enable the qubits to maintain their quantum state. The quantum processor chip, which holds the qubits and performs the calculations, is positioned towards the bottom of the chandelier.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, IBM has shipped five on-premise machines to customers, with recipients including South Korea\u2019s Yonsei University, the University of Tokyo, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York.\n\nIn December 2023, IBM unveiled a host of new quantum hardware and software products, including a 133 fixed-frequency qubit processor dubbed IBM Quantum Heron and IBM Quantum System Two, the company\u2019s first modular quantum computer.\n\nIn May 2024, the company announced it would be deploying an IBM Quantum System Two quantum computer at the Riken Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan.\n\nUpdate: IBM states during its Investor Day presentation that it has 13 utility-scale quantum computers (100+ qubits) operational in Poughkeepsie, NY; its German data center; and in client locations around the world.\n\nIn total, the company claims to have deployed just shy of 80 quantum systems since 2016, more than the rest of the world combined, according to publicly available data cited by IBM.",

This strategic focus on quantum and AI was especially evident in IBM\u2019s latest quarterly and annual updates.\n\nThe company, which released its fourth quarter 2024 earnings report last week to Wall Street approval, indicated AI is critical to IBM\u2019s growth. Generative AI has earned IBM a cumulative $5 billion, the company\u2019s Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer, in a statement on the Q4 earnings.\n\n\u201cWe closed the year with double-digit revenue growth in Software for the quarter, led by further acceleration in Red Hat. Clients globally continue to turn to IBM to transform with AI. Our generative AI book of business now stands at more than $5 billion inception-to-date, up nearly $2 billion quarter over quarter,\u201d said Krishna. \u201cThree years ago, we laid out a vision for a faster-growing, more-profitable IBM. I\u2019m proud of the work the IBM team has done to meet or exceed our commitments. With our focused strategy, enhanced portfolio, and culture of innovation, we\u2019re well-positioned for 2025 and beyond and expect revenue growth of at least five percent and free cash flow of about $13.5 billion this year.\u201d\n\nEmerging Technologies, Increasing Investments\n\nAccording to the earnings report, IBM is increasing their investments in those deep techs. The report shows that segment profit was $1.06 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the last quarter, which was mainly attributed to higher investments in areas such as AI, hybrid cloud and quantum.\n\nIBM also called out quantum in its investors\u2019 newsletter for Q4 2024 with a series of highlights, including the launch of its most advanced quantum computers, driving progress toward quantum advantage. Additionally, the company announced a collaboration to establish the National Quantum Algorithm Center at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park in Chicago, expanding its quantum footprint.\n\nThe moves in quantum and AI underscore IBM\u2019s strategic focus on emerging technologies, according to Krishna.\n\n\u201cWith more than 75 quantum systems deployed worldwide, our focus on emerging innovation is clear,\u201d Krishna said during the earnings call. \u201cThis quarter we announced a collaboration with the State of Illinois to establish the National Quantum Algorithm Center in Chicago. M&A remains a key enabler of our strategy. The acquisition of Neural Magic strengthens our AI solutions with advanced model optimization.\u201d\n\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Highlights\n\nIn other fourth quarter news, IBM reported revenue of $17.6 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, or 2% when adjusted for constant currency. Software revenue grew by 10%, while consulting and infrastructure revenues saw declines of 2% and 8%, respectively. Gross profit margin reached 59.5% (GAAP), up 40 basis points, and 60.6% on a non-GAAP basis, up 50 basis points.\n\nFor the full year, IBM achieved total revenue of $62.8 billion, reflecting a 1% increase, or 3% at constant currency. Software revenue was up 8%, while consulting and infrastructure revenue declined by 1% and 4%, respectively.

Nations appeared on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Wednesday to share his views on three stocks on the move lately. He said he is taking a wait-and-see approach to IBM after a strong run. Here were his quick takes during \"Three-Stock Lunch.\" IBM IBM last week reported fourth-quarter results whose earnings and revenue topped Wall Street estimates. The tech firm said software revenue grew 10% to $7.9 billion from the year-earlier period, partially due to demand for AI technology and strong performance from its Red Hat Linux operating system. Still, Nations said there are nagging worries about the stock despite IBM's robust earnings. IBM shares touched an all-time on Wednesday. IBM is \"approaching AI differently than some of the other big names, taking more of the DeepSeek approach; we're going to have to see if that works for them,\" Nations said. \"So I'm holding until we get a little bit more clarity.\" China's DeepSeek shook global stock markets after revealing that it had built a powerful AI model for just $6 million. Some have disputed the shockingly low cost of developing the AI models, while others believe DeepSeek has sharply cut the cost of running powerful AI models and that the firm's decision to release its technology for free has altered the course of the industry. In a statement, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has secured $5 billion in bookings for its generative AI business, which includes sales and future sales in the company's software and consulting division. \"We closed the year with double-digit revenue growth in Software for the quarter, led by further acceleration in Red Hat,\" Krishna said in a statement. \"Clients globally continue to turn to IBM to transform with AI.\" Uber Nations is buying the dip in Uber after the ride-hailing company sold off sharply Wednesday following a quarterly earnings miss and soft guidance about future results. The money manager likes the fact that Uber is accelerating stock repurchases. Uber also announced it is gearing up for the public launch of robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, through its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo division. Uber estimates that the autonomous vehicle market in the U.S. alone is a trillion-dollar opportunity, but CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said it will take \"many, many years\" to build out the business. Even with the company's \"aggressive investments\" in the technology, it is unlikely to affect Uber's outlook in the near term, he said. Mattel Mattel's shares soared 14% to a 52-week high Wednesday after the Barbie maker posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Mattel reported profits of 35 cents per share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $1.65 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG forecast 20 cents per share on revenue of $1.63 billion. Nations said he would buy the stock if it dips below $20 per share. Mattel briefly traded as low as $20.18 Wednesday morning. He added that investors could be cheering on the toymaker's increased stock buyback authorization. \"What really gets people interested are the stock buybacks \u2014 $600 million in 2023 and 2024 combined, another $600 million this year,\" Nations said.",

            "content": "However, equity markets rebounded strongly as global earnings soared, primarily driven by Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Since dividends are typically determined by conservative boards and management, they tend to lag behind earnings during significant earnings surges. As a result, dividend payout ratios are now near their lowest levels in 25 years, meaning companies are paying out less compared to historical averages. Simply returning to a more typical payout level could contribute an additional 2% annual growth over the next five years. This isn\u2019t just a theoretical scenario\u2014global dividend growth has already started to exceed earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters, as reported by J.P. Morgan.\n\nBecause of this earnings and income potential, income investors often turn to dividend stocks when the market shifts. While these stocks may not be keeping pace with the broader market, analysts remain optimistic about their future prospects. A report from J.P. Morgan indicated that global equities are approaching a notable period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a long-term increase in dividend momentum. Over the past 20 years, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts predict this growth will accelerate to 7.6%. The main factor driving this increased growth is the low starting point of payout ratios (dividends as a proportion of earnings). During the Covid pandemic in 2020, many companies cut their dividends, leading to a 12% drop in global dividends, which was a steeper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This was a rational response to an uncertain environment with unpredictable effects and duration.\n\nIn recent years, many investors have shifted their focus from dividend-paying stocks to high-growth secular-themed stocks that typically don\u2019t offer dividends. However, history shows that investors shouldn\u2019t overlook dividends. According to estimates by AGF Investments, the long-term case for dividend-paying equities is strong: if a dollar was invested in the broader market Index in 1927 without reinvesting dividends, it would be worth $243 today. In contrast, that same dollar with dividends reinvested would be worth $3,737.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold . In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy and hold.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile recent market gains have largely been driven by a small group of non-dividend-paying companies, this is starting to shift. In 2024, many big tech companies initiated their dividend policies, highlighting the importance of returning capital to shareholders and positioning dividends as a complement to share buybacks. The report highlighted that although the dividend yields from these tech giants are initially modest, the total amount they are committing to dividends is significant\u2014$17 billion collectively over the next year. More importantly, these actions send a strong signal to the market.\n\nIncome-focused investors have increasingly turned their attention to dividend income, making it a more prominent part of personal earnings. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that dividend income has risen from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, demonstrating its growing importance as an income source. The report further highlighted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for over a third of total equity returns, with the rest coming from capital gains.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned through various credible sources, including Business Insider, Forbes, Morningstar, and Barron\u2019s, and identified their consensus picks from their recent articles. Next, we sorted these companies based on the number of hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database that owned stakes in these companies, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) the Best Dividend Stock To Buy and Hold?\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational technology company. In its recently released Q4 2024 earnings, the company reported $17.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 1% increase compared to the same period last year. The company ended the year with double-digit revenue growth in its Software segment, fueled by strong momentum in Red Hat. Businesses worldwide are increasingly relying on IBM for AI-driven transformation. Its generative AI business has now surpassed $5 billion in total, growing by nearly $2 billion from the previous quarter.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has outperformed the market in the past 12 months, surging by nearly 44%. The company has reinvented itself as a leader in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Its advancements in hybrid cloud technology and the development of Watsonx AI have solidified its position in the tech industry. However, one area that has received less focus is its progress in quantum computing. IBM is considered a frontrunner in this field, leading some investors to evaluate whether this cutting-edge technology enhances the appeal of its stock.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), one of the best dividend stocks, has been growing its dividends for 29 consecutive years. The company reported solid cash results for 2024. It generated $13.4 billion in operating cash flow, with free cash flow totaling $12.7 billion. In Q4 2024, IBM returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $1.67 per share for a dividend yield of 2.53%, as of February 4.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 56 funds held stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), up from 54 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $1.7 billion.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 9th on our list of best dividend stocks to buy and hold. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This breathe of investment includes for customer service, supply chain operations, talent acquisition, and marketing innovation.\n\nThe adoption of AI has accelerated as 81 percent of surveyed executives and 96 percent of their team are already using AI to a moderate or significant extent. Executives indicate they want to expand AI usage to more sophisticated use cases, such as integrated business planning.\n\nUse in the workforce will continue to grow, as 31 percent of employees will need to learn new skills to work with AI in the next year according to respondents\u2014increasing to 45 percent within three years.\n\nCustomer Service Growth\n\nThe largest growth area is expected in customer service, as personalized responses and follow-ups, could grow by 236 percent in the next 12 months when compared to the prior year based on survey responses. Notably, responses indicate that 55 percent of these improvements are expected to involve human-AI collaboration, while only 30 percent would be fully automated.\n\nWhere the money will be invested is in tools that facilitate exchange of data and AI models. Respondents indicated they expect growth from 52 percent today to 89 percent within three years as their companies look to blend AI capabilities with business and technology partners to accelerate innovation and drive efficiencies.\n\nBut for all the talk about increasingly using AI, there remains a significant gap between actual practices being installed. Despite 87 percent of surveyed executives claiming to have clear AI governance frameworks, fewer than 25 percent have fully implemented and continuously review tools to manage risks like bias, transparency, and security. This reveals a critical gap in operational oversight.\n\nRetail at AI Tipping Point\n\nIBM officials emphasized that successful brands can evolve from viewing AI as merely a productivity booster to positioning it as a core driver of enterprise innovation\u2014the transformation will require rethinking traditional governance and reskilling strategies. Retailers will need to tailor AI initiatives to align with their brand priorities and collaborate with strategic partners, including start-ups and technology companies.\n\nEqually important is breaking down silos between finance, technology, and business leaders. By fostering cross-functional collaboration, business can demonstrate how AI can help deliver a long-term competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cRetail and consumer product companies are at a tipping point where embedding AI across their operations can help define not just productivity gains, but the future of brand relevance, engagement and trust,\u201d said Waddell.\n\nRelated stories:",

At the end of 2024, IBM exceeded the three-year mid-term model metrics related to revenue, profitability and cash flow growth that it laid out at the end of 2021.\n\nIBM Rides on Cloud, AI Demand\n\nIBM\u2019s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has translated into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions.\n\n\n\nThe buyout of HashiCorp has further augmented IBM\u2019s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp\u2019s tool sets complement IBM RedHat\u2019s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HashiCorp\u2019s cloud software capabilities has bolstered IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach. The acquisitions of StreamSets and webMethods have improved IBM\u2019s AI platform and automation capabilities, bringing together key competencies in integration, API management and data ingestion. Complementing IBM DataStage and Databand platform with a hybrid and multi-cloud approach, the buyouts have enabled IBM to develop comprehensive application and data integration platforms in the industry.\n\nHealthy Margins Bouy IBM\n\nDespite economic uncertainty due to geopolitical issues, supply chain vulnerabilities, incessant cyber threats and the evolving landscape of interest rates and inflation levels, IBM's margins have improved over the past few quarters. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 improved to $10.44 billion from $10.23 billion in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 59.5% and 59.1% owing to a strong portfolio mix. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains, and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability and help IBM deliver sustainable growth with advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM to Focus More on Watsonx Platform\n\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities.

            "content": "Even as advancements make it easier to build large AI models, a bigger challenge remains: the enormous computing power required to stay competitive. Xia \u201cBen\u201d Hu, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Rice University, acknowledges that DeepSeek is a more efficient step forward in AI development. However, he notes that it doesn\u2019t fundamentally shift the overall power dynamics in AI infrastructure, where access to vast computing resources still determines who leads the race.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is backed by a large venture fund in China, and has access to tens of thousands of GPUs,\u201d Hu says. \u201cThat\u2019s still a major barrier for many smaller startups.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hu predicts that the most significant shift would likely be in enterprise AI adoption. \u201cTraditional industries\u2014oil and gas, manufacturing\u2014have been hesitant to develop their own AI solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cWith costs dropping and open-source models improving, companies that once relied on external AI services are now considering building in-house models tailored to their specific needs.\u201d\n\nThe implications go beyond one model. With open-source AI projects multiplying, smaller startups can now access tools that once required massive data centers and enormous budgets. Cox said that OpenAI and its counterparts have long projected an \u201cair of inevitability\u201d\u2014that only those with deep pockets could lead in AI. But as DeepSeek and other models emerge, that notion is starting to crack.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift where a much broader aperture of players can compete in this space,\u201d Cox says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that anybody with USD 5 million can roll up and build a top-tier model overnight. But well-funded startups and midsized companies? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nResearchers are also focusing on efficiency rather than raw computing power. Cox and his research team have zeroed in on the Mixture of Experts approach, which allows AI to be more selective about how it uses processing resources.\n\n\"Mixture of Experts is just one piece of the puzzle\u2014there's a lot more coming,\" he says, suggesting that the future of AI may depend less on access to advanced chips and more on smarter ways of using existing hardware.\n\nSattigeri highlighted one such innovation: the rise of synthetic data, or artificially generated information that mimics real-world data. \u201cWith models like DeepSeek, we\u2019re seeing a shift toward using AI-generated synthetic data to refine and train models more efficiently,\u201d he says. \u201cThis could significantly lower costs and make high-quality AI accessible to more players.\u201d\n\nThe increasing accessibility of AI development raises new questions about the future of competition. Will infrastructure and computing power still determine the winners, or will the ability to innovate quickly become the most valuable asset? According to Cox, it\u2019s a mix of both.\n\n\u201cYou still need serious infrastructure, you still need great talent, but the moat that OpenAI and Google have isn\u2019t as deep as they\u2019d like people to believe,\u201d he says. \u201cSecrets don\u2019t stay secret in this field. Ideas spread, and people move around. We\u2019re seeing rapid convergence.\u201d\n\nHu added that AI development still requires four critical components: \u201cI call it the ABCD model\u2014Algorithms, Big Data, Compute and Distribution,\u201d he says. \u201cThe best AI companies have all four. DeepSeek is making a dent in the first two, but compute and distribution still give the major players an edge.\u201d",

            "content": "This week, I checked in with IBM execs and market analysts to learn about the industry-wide potential behind the new partnership between L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group and tech juggernaut IBM. I also spoke with the founder of Silicon Valley startup Potion AI, which is providing AI-powered formulation competition for smaller brands and manufacturers amid this sea change.\n\nAdditionally, beauty incubator Maesa sells its European and Middle Eastern operations, the Brazilian beauty market heats up, and executive moves at Victoria Beckham Beauty, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies and Glow Recipe.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Group makes strides in AI-powered formulation with new IBM partnership\n\nThere\u2019s a race underway to use artificial intelligence to improve the way everyday consumer products are made.\n\nThis can be seen in healthcare with the development of new pharmaceutical drugs. According to early analysis, the use of AI could save 20% on R&D costs, which could equate to billions of dollars saved per year. AI is also being used in the fashion industry by brands like Merrill and Puma to find and test more eco-friendly processes.\n\nWhen it comes to beauty, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies\u2019 partnership with Microsoft and OpenAI is one to watch: It strives to harness AI for product formulation, regulatory compliance and more.\n\nNow, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group is entering the race with a new partnership with IBM, one of the largest tech companies in the world. Announced on January 20, the partnership is primed to help L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group reach its goal to source mostly bio-based or circular materials by 2030.\n\n\u201cAlmost all the major players in the beauty industry are using AI-based technology to accelerate the research and development process [right now],\u201d Madhav Pitaliya, Coresight research analyst, told Glossy. \u201cBasically, AI is helping them to analyze vast amounts of data [around] ingredients, formulas and consumer preference.\u201d\n\nThe blueprint for this technological advancement lies in the healthcare sector. \u201cDrug discovery is a very tedious task but when AI [was introduced], drug discovery timing was reduced significantly,\u201d Pitaliya said. \u201cWe are likely to witness something similar in the beauty sector.\u201d\n\nThis means sourcing raw materials \u2014 including identifying and analyzing environmental concerns and labor practices across a supply chain \u2014 as well as formulating and testing can all happen faster. In turn, avoiding problematic ingredients, staying in compliance with evolving retailer clean beauty standards and regulatory compliance can all happen with the click of a button.\n\nThe new tech, called an AI foundation model, leverages IBM\u2019s generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology to build a custom model for L\u2019Oreal. However, some IBM GenAI tools are open-source and, therefore, available to companies for free.\n\n\u201cWe are living in an incredible moment where different companies are sharing [advancements in] the digital research field,\u201d Guilhaume Leroy-M\u00e9line, IBM distinguished engineer and CTO of business transformation, told Glossy. \u201cI like to say that AI generates so humans can accelerate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis partnership will extend the speed and scale of our innovation and reformulation pipeline, with products always reaching higher standards of inclusivity, sustainability and personalization\u201d, said St\u00e9phane Ortiz, head of innovation m\u00e9tiers and product development in L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s research and innovation department.\n\nThe first big achievement could be around personalization, IBM\u2019s Leroy-M\u00e9line told Glossy. For example, using public data and a company\u2019s internal data collected over years, a chemist could create a product made specifically for a small or underserved consumer base then accurately forecast the quantity needed.\n\nIn theory, an AI foundation model could look at a certain demographic, like South Asian women, American tweens or those living in extreme cold. It could then factor in data around historical use cases and sales trends of competing products, cultural considerations like religion or values, hobbies, seasonal supply chain shipment limitations, active tariffs, sales data to predict where and when this demo shops most, and anything else important to the creation, sale or afterlife of the product.\n\nStill, it won\u2019t be perfect or at lightning speed \u2014 yet. \u201cI like to say that alone we go faster, but together we go further,\u201d said IBM\u2019s Leroy-M\u00e9line. \u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to explore and apply with AI technology these days. Partnerships like these really put into perspective the art of what\u2019s possible.\u201d IBM offers open-source tech and, similarly to its L\u2019Or\u00e9al partnership, is available to build AI foundation models for all brands, as well.\n\nThere is also fresh competition popping up now, like Potion AI. \u201cI would predict that you could launch products in about half the time [than without an AI tool],\u201d said Hejab Malik, co-founder and chief product officer of Potion AI, an AI-powered platform that helps contract manufacturers, indie chemists and brands formulate faster. The Silicon Valley-based startup launched in April 2024 and its client base has grown 47% month-over-month, Malik told Glossy.\n\n\u201cContract manufacturers that use our tools report saving 10-20 hours at the beginning of a project,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIf you apply that across the board with product development, you can really see how time savings equals cost savings.\u201d\n\nPotion AI was trained by first aggregating public and private data around scientific knowledge, educational resources, popular product formulations and ingredient data, then formulation data obtained from brands and manufacturers was added to the mix. \u201cIn AI model training, you need both failure data and passing data to really fine-tune our models,\u201d Malik told Glossy.\n\nTranslation: Potion AI can read and remember known product recipes, cross reference them for new safety data or clean beauty compliance lists at top retailers like Sephora or Ulta Beauty, and create a benchmark to start new product formulation immediately.\n\nMalik told Glossy that a big time saver is early formulation. The company\u2019s AI helps brands create fewer product iterations to save time, money and resources.\n\nWhile Potion AI doesn\u2019t share its client list, execs from brands like Olaplex and Arcaesa, manufacturers like Luluble and THG Labs, and ingredient supplies like Botanigenics and 3V Sigma have all publicly recommended the platform on LinkedIn.\n\nPotion AI does not publish its rates but strives to keep costs very competitive as it grows, Malik said. \u201cWe\u2019re marketing [platform] adoption [now], not trying to squeeze money from one company,\u201d she said.\n\nJob loss is, of course, a growing concern with AI. \u201cPeople think their jobs are going to get replaced, but we think [it\u2019s actually the] manual, repetitive tasks that will get replaced so that those same people can hopefully do more creative and innovative work,\u201d Potion AI\u2019s Malik said.\n\nHowever, Coresight\u2019s Pitaliya told Glossy that jobs like supply chain analysts, demand forecasters and inventory managers are likely to be reduced eventually if this tech continues.\n\nIBM is publicly traded and reported 3% growth in 2024 to reach $63 billion in revenue. L\u2019Oreal Group reported $45 billion in revenue for 2023, up 7.6% for FY 2022.\n\nFor 2025, Malik suggests all brands get comfortable with their company\u2019s data \u2014 how it\u2019s collected, stored and analyzed \u2014 as well as the use of AI agents. \u201cI can tell you from being in Silicon Valley, the thing [to understand] in 2025 is AI agents,\u201d she told Glossy. \u201cYou used to have software that humans could operate, and now it\u2019s going to shift to AI agents operating the software with oversight [from the human].\u201d\n\nExecutive moves:\n\nLauren Edelman is the new CEO of Victoria Beckham Beauty. Edelman joined the company in May 2023 as global CMO. She\u2019s succeeding Katia Beauchamp in the CEO role. Victoria Beckham Beauty launched in 2019 and is privately held. Edelman\u2019s CV includes nine years at Chanel and four years at L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n\n\n\nMichael O\u2019Hare, evp and chief human resources officer at Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, is set to retire on April 1. A successor has not yet been named. O\u2019Hare has been with ELC for 13 years.\n\n\n\nMallory Goodman is the new svp of brand for body-care brand Ma\u00eblys. Her CV includes Glow Recipe, Korres and Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies.\n\nNews to know:\n\nActivists have called for a boycott of Target after the company announced its plans to roll back its DEI initiatives. Target is one of many companies reversing diversity-, equity- and inclusion-focused corporate initiatives, many of which were implemented or expanded in 2020. According to reporting by Time, corporations like Amazon, Walmart and Meta have also rolled back similar initiatives. Corporate DEI was under fire for much of 2024.\n\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies-owned MAC cosmetics launched a splashy campaign on Tuesday starring Martha Stewart, Julia Fox, Tiffany \u201cNew York\u201d Pollard, Odell Beckham Jr. and more celebrities, all in various states of undress. The \u201cI Only Wear MAC\u201d lipstick campaign centers around the company\u2019s expansive lineup of nude lipsticks.\n\n\n\nIn a second news-making campaign last week, ELC announced that model Paulina Porizkova will return to Est\u00e9e Lauder as its global brand ambassador. She held the role from 1988-1995. Her return to the conglomerate is centered around a pro-aging campaign called \u201cBecause of my age.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnnounced Monday, Canada-based personal care manufacturer kdc/one has acquired Maesa\u2019s European and Middle Eastern operations. Maesa is a New York-based incubator behind brands like Kristin Ess, Being Frenshe, Hairitage by Mindy McKnight and Fine\u2019ry. \u201cWith this transaction, I am excited to continue to strengthen Maesa\u2019s focus on innovation and redefining the consumer experience in beauty through leading innovation both on our existing portfolio of brands and launching exciting new ones,\u201d Piyush Jain, CEO of Maesa, said in a statement. \u201cThis strategic move will enable Maesa to continue to accelerate our rapid growth globally.\u201d\n\n\n\nJapanese skin-care brand Damdam has raised $3 million in seed funding from Silas Capital, the private equity firm that has backed Ilia, Makeup by Mario, Vacation and others. Damdam launched into select Sephora doors in August. Its products are priced between $38-$68.\n\n\n\nIt was a big week for the derm-focused skin-care market. Cult peptide brand Medik8 launched a $92 serum DTC called Liquid Peptides Advanced MP Serum, while Dr. Diamond Metacine opened DTC pre-orders for its new InstaFacial Infusion serum. In addition, Ilia Beauty launched a barrier cream called Barrier Build through Sephora, while a new skin-care brand called Erly debuted at the retailer. These launches are part of the growing dermocosmetics market, which is anticipated to grow from $39 billion in 2023 to an anticipated $112 billion by 2034, according to new data released Friday from Research and Markets.\n\nStat of the week:\n\nThe beauty market in Brazil is heating up, according to new data released on Friday from Technavio market research company. According to the firm, the cosmetics market in Brazil is estimated to grow by $5.5 billion between 2025 and 2029. This growth is led by e-commerce sales, according to the report.\n\nIn the headlines:\n\nGlow Recipe launches skin-care-based makeup.

There is a lot of work ahead in the sustainability field, but I am thrilled to be working on this important issue here.\n\nSustainability is not just a feel-good word here, it is in our DNA. Our legacy includes leading the charge in creating environmental policies well before most companies (1971), helping to develop international standards and driving toward ambitious environmental goals in line with the UN IPCC. To build on that as IBM prioritises the hybrid cloud and AI space is an amazing opportunity.\n\nIn this role, I am able to tap into technology and experts from throughout IBM, as well as collaborate closely with our wonderful partners across the public, private and nonprofit sectors. IBM also serves as \u201cclient zero\u201d for many of the cutting-edge technologies that we bring to market, which gives my office the opportunity to test and refine solutions and accelerate our own sustainability efforts with strong support from the business.",

(IBM) has projected a robust revenue growth trajectory, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily driven by its expanding software business. During a presentation, IBM\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jim Kavanaugh, announced that the company anticipates long-term sales to grow more than 5% annually, without specifying the exact timeframe, but analysts had previously forecasted around 4% growth for the fiscal years 2026 and 2027 in constant currency.\n\nIBM\u2019s strategic pivot from traditional hardware to a focus on software and services has been facilitated through significant acquisitions, such as the proposed acquisition of HashiCorp Inc. (HCP) and the completed purchase of Apptio for $4.6 billion. These moves are part of IBM\u2019s broader transformation strategy to bolster its product offerings and market position.\n\nThe market reacted positively to IBM\u2019s outlook, pushing shares up $3.73 or 1.43% to close at $264.46. The stock hit a 52-week high of $265.25, building on a 13% surge from January 30, driven by strong Q4 results and a 2025 revenue forecast projecting at least 5% growth in constant currency. Kavanaugh highlighted that the software segment is expected to see an annual growth of about 10%, exceeding previous analyst projections of 7%-9% through 2027. Conversely, the infrastructure segment is projected to grow at a more modest pace of 1%-3%, with future revenue expected from innovations like quantum computing.\n\nDespite the upbeat software outlook, IBM\u2019s consulting division, which has seen challenges recently, is anticipated to grow faster than the market, adapting to the shift towards Generative AI (GenAI) technologies. However, Anurag Rana from Bloomberg Intelligence noted that IBM\u2019s sales outlook, while strong, might be seen as cautious given the software segment\u2019s strength, suggesting that consulting might not recover quickly. This mixed performance across different units underscores IBM\u2019s ongoing transformation and the nuanced challenges it faces in navigating market transitions while capitalizing on technological advancements.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

To a person, the budget that they will cut last if there is ever an issue is their software budget,\u2019 says IBM CEO Arvind Krishna.\n\nIBM\u2019s better-than-expected fourth fiscal quarter sent its stock soaring nearly 12 percent Wednesday to Friday and commentary from the cloud and mainframe giant\u2019s leadership shows positive signs for tech acquisitions, business spending and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Armonk, N.Y.-based vendor, which has thousands of partners in its ecosystem, forecasts 5-plus percent revenue growth year over year in 2025, with software growing double digits, Red Hat growing in the midteens, consulting growing in the low single digits and infrastructure and mainframes adding a point to revenue growth, IBM CFO Jim Kavanaugh said on the latest quarterly earnings call.\n\nAlthough IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna (pictured) didn\u2019t mention newly sworn in U.S. President Donald Trump or other world leaders, he said he anticipates \u201ca regulatory environment that is a bit more rational and a bit more pro-competition.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: IBM CEO: GenAI With Consulting Driving Future Growth]\n\nIBM Q4 Earnings\n\nIBM\u2019s $7 billion purchase of Terraform creator and cloud provider HashiCorp, unveiled in April and intended to close before 2025 started, has received scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\n\n\u201cWe think reasonable deals have a very good chance of getting through in a reasonable amount of time and not being held up for years,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cWith that context, that means, obviously, we are going to lean in more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking specifically about the nearly yearlong HashiCorp deal, Krishna said \u201cwe certainly hope that with a friendlier environment, that gets done soon, and that then begins to open up the aperture for getting more deals done.\u201d\n\nKavanugh said that IBM is factoring HashiCorp revenue as part of its guidance. \u201cWe fully expect to close the Hashi transaction in a relatively soon period of time,\u201d the CFO said. He said HashiCorp should contribute about a point of revenue growth to IBM in 2025.\n\nCRN has reached out to IBM to see if the U.S. Department of Justice filing a lawsuit to prevent Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks has changed their executives\u2019 view of the regulatory environment.\n\nIn a report Thursday, Melius Research predicted that the HashiCorp deal will close in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nKrishna said that he finds \u201cmore optimism in the business climate, and there is more optimism on the growth that is possible in \u201925 compared to \u201924\u201d due in part to improving geopolitics and less \u201cfriction.\u201d\n\nHe maintained his optimistic view on business technology spending, saying that \u201ceverybody believes technology is now essential for helping them grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you service customers better?

So software is the basis for all of those capabilities,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cTo a person, the budget that they will cut last if there is ever an issue is their software budget. That is what is giving us confidence.\u201d\n\nIBM Weighs In On DeepSeek\n\nKrishna echoed other sentiments from AI leaders about the apparent advancements China-based AI lab DeepSeek has brought to the emerging field.\n\nOn the earnings call, Krishna brought to mind Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s \u201cgood news\u201dobservation on DeepSeek\u2019s potential breakthrough of a powerful AI model run locally and built with less capital than expected, with that breakthrough perhaps leading to easier adoption of AI.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek, I think, was a point of validation,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cWe have been very vocal for about a year that smaller models and more reasonable training times are going to be essential for enterprise deployment of large language models.\u201d\n\nKrishna touted IBM\u2019s own work democratizing AI, seeing \u201cas much as 30 times reduction in inference costs using these approaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs other people begin to follow that route, we think that this is incredibly good for our enterprise clients, and we will certainly take advantage of that in our business, but I believe that others will also follow that route,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nKavanaugh said to expect the vendor still adds \u201ca couple $100 million\u201d to its capital expenditures as it invests in software, GenAI, next-generation mainframes and quantum computing.\n\nMainframe Grows In The AI Era\n\nAI has captured the imagination and attention of the business technology world, but Kavanaugh pointed out that IBM\u2019s mainframe portfolio showed positive momentum in the quarter.\n\nSeventy percent of mainframe clients are growing capacity, measured in millions instructions per second (MIPS). \u201cThat is a very different profile than where we were 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cInstalled MIPS are up 3X over the last few cycles.\u201d\n\nIBM runs workloads for 97 percent of the mission-critical transactional processing in banking, retail, airlines and other industries. IBM\u2019s transaction processing revenue grew 11 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nKavanaugh attributed about 4 points of that growth to the capitalization of underlying workloads driving mainframe and 3 points to Watsonx Code Assistant for Z and GenAI monetization on the mainframe platform.\n\nAI Spending Environment Aiding Consulting\n\nIBM exeuctives said the generative AI book of business grew $2 billion quarter over quarter to $5 billion.\n\nOf wider importance to the channel, that spending came mostly in IBM Consulting, No. 6 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500. Those bookings contributed to IBM saying to expect growth in consulting to accelerate from flat to mid single digits by the end of 2025, particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nKavanaugh said consulting ended the fiscal year with the \u201chighest recorded ever signings quarter, up 23 percent.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned against too much excitement given that consulting is \u201cstill dealing with a very dynamic environment around clients prioritizing spend.\u201d\n\nCustomers, like IBM itself, \u201care cutting back on discretionary-based spend so we can fuel investment into digital transformation and GenAI overall,\u201d Kavanaugh said. And winning customers\u2019 trust early in the AI race is important for the consulting business, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so maniacally focused because enterprise clients are making their strategic provider of choice decisions,\u201d the CFO said. \u201cThat is going to be a long-term future vector of growth for consulting for us to win that has a multiplier effect that will drag our software component of our business going forward. So we feel pretty good.\u201d",

            "content": "Robinhood has been focusing on organic growth by implementing strategies such as deposit matches and marketing initiatives, as well as investing in both its current operations and new ventures. Additionally, the company has been using mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to accelerate its business expansion.\n\nThough Robinhood experienced significant growth in its customer base during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people stayed home and invested in their government stimulus checks, years later, the platform has continued to attract even more customers, many of whom have become more knowledgeable and now expect advanced tools, which Robinhood has adapted to offer.\n\nAccording to analysts, Robinhood has significant growth potential, particularly if it can encourage customers who have opened accounts to invest larger sums of money on the platform. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley highlighted that while 10% of US adults have a funded account with Robinhood, the company currently controls less than 0.3% of the $65 trillion in retail assets in the US As of June 2024, Robinhood has facilitated over $200 million in asset transfer and retirement account contribution matches for its customers. This initiative helped the company secure over $13 billion in net deposits during the second quarter, with assets under custody reaching a record $140 billion\u2014an increase of 57% from the previous year. Additionally, retirement assets more than doubled, nearing $9 billion.\n\nAs stock prices hit historic lows, younger investors flocked to platforms like Robinhood. Founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood quickly became a fintech favorite. The app, which pioneered commission-free trading, amassed 13 million user accounts and gained significant brand recognition, surpassing legacy brokerages like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, as well as app-first competitors like Webull and Dough.\n\nThe start of 2020 marked a turning point for retail trading, driven by increased market volatility, stay-at-home orders, and commission-free trading across platforms, which led to a surge in activity and a rise in new traders. Many of these new traders, particularly in their 20s and 30s, found the stock market more accessible than ever, as high prices had previously kept them from participating. With sports events canceled, many turned to stock trading as a replacement for sports betting.\n\nWe recently published a list of Top 10 Best Dividend Stocks on Robinhood . In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other best dividend stocks on Robinhood.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to technological improvements, shifts in asset classes and market structure have also played a role in the emergence of new investment products. One of the most notable innovations in 2024 was the introduction of event contracts, especially those based on elections. In addition, many other brokerages, fintech firms, and financial institutions introduced a wide range of new products that reshaped how retail investors could manage their investments, all while generating profits. The shift began in January when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin (BTCUSD) exchange-traded funds. This decision enabled retail investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure through their brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to open digital wallets for direct crypto purchases.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we performed an extensive analysis of leading financial websites to identify 10 dividend stocks available on Robinhood. Our selection process was based on a consensus approach, where we considered only those stocks that consistently appeared across multiple sources during our research. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked according to hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) the Best Dividend Stock on Robinhood?\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) ranks seventh on our list of the best dividend stocks on Robinhood. The company has transformed itself into a cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) leader. Its contributions to the hybrid cloud and the development of its Watsonx AI have positioned it as a key player in the technology sector. One aspect of IBM that has received less attention is its work in quantum computing. In many ways, IBM is a leader in this field, prompting some investors to consider whether this advanced technology makes IBM stock an attractive investment. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 39%, outperforming the market by a wide margin.\n\nIn its recently announced Q4 2024 earnings, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reported revenue of $17.6 billion, up 1% from the same period last year. The company finished the year with double-digit revenue growth in its Software segment for the quarter, driven by continued acceleration in Red Hat. Clients around the world are increasingly turning to IBM to help them transform using AI. The company\u2019s generative AI business has now reached over $5 billion in total, marking an increase of nearly $2 billion from the previous quarter.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s cash results also came in strong in 2024. During the year, the company generated $13.4 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow came in at $12.7 billion. In Q4 2024, it returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as of January 30. IBM has raised its payouts for 29 consecutive years.\n\nOf the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 56 funds held stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), up from 54 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $1.7 billion.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 7th on our list of best dividend stocks on Robinhood. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

For example, BSW Wealth Partners increased its stake by 35.4% during the fourth quarter, holding 4,548 shares at the end of the period, valued at about $1,000,000.\n\nEqually important, the institution's overall stake is now owned by 58.96% of corporate stocks. These moves by institutional investors signify their confidence and strategic positioning within the technological domain where IBM has been placing its emphasis.\n\nThis technical progress aligns with Jon A. Macon's statement from IBM, praising the company's strides toward digital transformation and AI solutions. The technology powerhouse operates through software, consulting, infrastructure, and financing segments, all of which are enhancing its service offerings across various market sectors.\n\nAdding to the appeal for investors, IBM recently declared its quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, scheduled for payment on March 10, 2023. This payment signifies not only profitability but also investor return, reflecting IBM's commitment to stakeholder value. The annualized dividend stands at $6.68, with the current dividend yield at 2.61%. Notably, this dividend payout ratio is at 104.21%, indicating the company's strong ability to produce revenue.\n\nInsider trading has also been documented, with SVP Nickle Jaclyn Lamoreaux selling 3,600 shares at $215.20, lowering their total share value. Post-transaction, Lamoreaux held 25,390 IBM shares, valued at approximately $5.46 million, indicating confidence amid fluctuations.\n\nResearch analysts maintain mixed ratings on IBM, with two analysts giving it 'sell' ratings, nine holding it, and five recommending buy positions, contributing to library insights for investors checking the latest suggestions. Average commentary emphasizes 'hold' ratings with target price averaging $225.53.\n\nEven though the overall perspective might seem conservative, the strong quarterly report presents new opportunities for IBM to exploit upcoming technological demands. Navigational versatility suggests a probable incline for those who believe strongly in IBM's foundational leverage within cloud and AI technologies. Keeping watch over institutional movements, earnings performance, and upcoming technology fairs might provide more instrumental data.\n\nThese developments showcase IBM standing firm on the precipice of technology growth with analysts expressing cautious optimism. With analysts highlighting the company's core abilities to innovate, the market session holds promise for savvy investors who track these dynamics closely.",

            "content": "International Business Machines (IBM 0.35%) stock surged 14% higher following its fourth-quarter and 2024 earnings report. Under CEO Arvind Krishna, the company has redefined itself as primarily a hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) company, and his leadership reversed what had been a long-term decline in the stock.\n\nConsequently, the stock price has risen by around 35% over the last year. Now, investors must assess whether the stock remains a buy with a higher earnings multiple and lower dividend yield.\n\nThe new IBM\n\nKrishna's turnaround at IBM began before he became CEO. As a division head, he spearheaded the purchase of Red Hat in 2019. This move made IBM a meaningful player in the hybrid cloud, and after taking the CEO job in April 2020, Krishna acquired more cloud companies.\n\nAlso, soon after GPT-4 changed the face of AI, IBM launched watsonx to support its work in next-generation foundation models. These developments led to the strong performance of its software segment, which grew its revenue by 8% during 2024.\n\nAdditionally, work in quantum computing has flourished under Krishna. While the technology has not yet gained widespread commercial interest, its ecosystem firmly positions IBM to prosper in this industry as more applications appear.\n\nFurthermore, IBM's dividend has risen for 29 straight years. At $6.68 per share annually, its dividend yield is 2.5%, even after the stock price increases. This is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.2%, presumably making IBM stock an excellent choice for dividend investors.\n\nHowever, other parts of the company resemble the stagnant IBM of the past. The consulting and infrastructure businesses still generate more combined revenue than the software segment. Unfortunately, consulting revenue grew by only 1%, while infrastructure revenue dropped 4% yearly in 2024.\n\nIBM's overall results and valuation\n\nUnsurprisingly, the differing results of IBM's segments affected its financial performance. In 2024, revenue of $63 billion grew by 1% yearly.\n\nMoreover, its 2024 net income actually fell to $6.0 billion versus $7.5 billion in 2023. A $2.8 billion decrease in income from foreign currency and other investments caused the drop, which indicates the lower earnings are not as concerning as they might appear.\n\nAdditionally, IBM's management offered a rosier outlook for the immediate future, revealing that the company expects revenue growth to rise to 5% in 2025. By the same token, it predicts free cash flow will rise to $13.5 billion in 2025, up from the $12.7 billion generated in 2024. This bodes well for continued increases in the dividend, which should reassure the stock's shareholders.\n\nUnfortunately, investors will have to pay for this increased prosperity. Thanks to the rising stock price, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now 39, well above the S&P 500 average of 30.\n\nAdmittedly, the forward P/E ratio is a more modest 23, which may have helped fuel the rising stock price. Still, the stock has undoubtedly become more expensive, and investors will have to decide whether it still offers value.\n\nShould I buy IBM stock?\n\nAt current levels, IBM is more likely a hold.\n\nGiven the record-high stock price and its rising prominence as a cloud and AI stock, one has to assume IBM has orchestrated a comeback under Krishna. Consequently, the success has led to significant gains for its shareholders.\n\nIndeed, the successes would likely improve if IBM could either revive or sell its stagnant consulting and infrastructure businesses. Nonetheless, the revenue forecast strongly indicates that the cloud and AI segments have revived IBM as a force in the tech industry, meaning investors should probably consider the stock if the valuation falls below the S&P 500 average.",

This is more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.2%, presumably making IBM stock an excellent choice for dividend investors.\n\nHowever, other parts of the company resemble the stagnant IBM of the past. The consulting and infrastructure businesses still generate more combined revenue than the software segment. Unfortunately, consulting revenue grew by only 1%, while infrastructure revenue dropped 4% yearly in 2024.\n\nIBM's overall results and valuation\n\nUnsurprisingly, the differing results of IBM's segments affected its financial performance. In 2024, revenue of $63 billion grew by 1% yearly.\n\nMoreover, its 2024 net income actually fell to $6.0 billion versus $7.5 billion in 2023. A $2.8 billion decrease in income from foreign currency and other investments caused the drop, which indicates the lower earnings are not as concerning as they might appear.\n\nAdditionally, IBM's management offered a rosier outlook for the immediate future, revealing that the company expects revenue growth to rise to 5% in 2025. By the same token, it predicts free cash flow will rise to $13.5 billion in 2025, up from the $12.7 billion generated in 2024. This bodes well for continued increases in the dividend, which should reassure the stock's shareholders.\n\nUnfortunately, investors will have to pay for this increased prosperity. Thanks to the rising stock price, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now 39, well above the S&P 500 average of 30.\n\nAdmittedly, the forward P/E ratio is a more modest 23, which may have helped fuel the rising stock price. Still, the stock has undoubtedly become more expensive, and investors will have to decide whether it still offers value.\n\nShould I buy IBM stock?\n\nAt current levels, IBM is more likely a hold.\n\nGiven the record-high stock price and its rising prominence as a cloud and AI stock, one has to assume IBM has orchestrated a comeback under Krishna. Consequently, the success has led to significant gains for its shareholders.\n\nIndeed, the successes would likely improve if IBM could either revive or sell its stagnant consulting and infrastructure businesses. Nonetheless, the revenue forecast strongly indicates that the cloud and AI segments have revived IBM as a force in the tech industry, meaning investors should probably consider the stock if the valuation falls below the S&P 500 average.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "It's been a long road for International Business Machines (IBM 0.45%) investors. The company kicked off a transformation effort more than a decade ago, forced to adapt to a tech industry that was rapidly embracing cloud computing. Years of inconsistent results followed as the company exited businesses and spent many billions of dollars on acquisitions.\n\nSome initiatives, like the company's early efforts to apply artificial intelligence (AI) technology to healthcare, were abject failures. Others, like the acquisition of software company Red Hat, have been roaring successes.\n\nIBM has leaned into high-margin software while using its consulting business to help drive adoption. Its hybrid cloud and AI software platforms are at the center of the company's best long-term growth opportunities. Red Hat software revenue soared 17% year over year in the fourth quarter, and IBM surpassed $5 billion in cumulative bookings for generative AI-related business. Over the past couple of years, things have finally been clicking.\n\nThe stock has responded to IBM's improving fortunes by soaring to an all-time high. Shares of IBM were up more than 10% by midday Thursday following the fourth-quarter report, carving out a new all-time high in the process. The stock has risen by about 90% over the past three years, and it's now up around 36% over the past year alone.\n\nWith IBM stock finally breaking out of its funk and trading at record levels, should investors buy into the growth story?\n\nA winning strategy\n\nAt its core, IBM's mission is to enable its clients to grow revenue, improve productivity, and boost efficiency. The company does this through software, consulting, and hardware. Software has become the largest component of IBM's revenue, accounting for about 45% of the total.\n\nWhile IBM's software business generates high profit margins, the consulting business does a lot of the heavy lifting. Consulting is a less profitable affair, but it helps drive adoption of IBM's software platforms and products. For example, of the $5 billion in generative AI bookings the company has amassed, about $4 billion of that total were in the form of consulting signings.\n\nIBM has embraced strategic partnerships with other technology companies, paving the way for new business that the company wouldn't have otherwise won. Since many enterprises are already using Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure for cloud computing, much of IBM's software can be deployed anywhere, and its consulting business is free to craft solutions that make use of those cloud platforms. A company that wants to modernize its IT infrastructure by moving some workloads to AWS, for example, can turn to IBM for its consulting services and its hybrid cloud platform.\n\nThe hardware segment isn't as important for IBM as it once was, but it's still a key part of the company's strategy. IBM's mainframe systems continue to enjoy wide use across certain industries, including financial services, and the latest z16 mainframe family has been the most successful mainframe generation in the company's history.\n\nBeyond mainframe sales, IBM can sell additional products to mainframe customers. One example is the watsonx Code Assistant for Z, a generative AI tool that helps mainframe customers modernize legacy applications.\n\nAccelerating growth and a reasonable valuation\n\nIBM grew revenue by 3% in 2024, adjusted for currency. This year, the company expects revenue growth to accelerate to at least 5%. A booming software business will help the cause. Software revenue rose by 9% last year, and IBM expects growth to approach double digits again in 2025.\n\nConsulting has been a mixed bag, with plenty of demand for digital transformations offset by weakness in more discretionary areas. Demand for AI consulting services could help return the segment to growth in 2025, although there are a lot of moving parts. Lastly, a new mainframe family is set to launch this year, which will contribute about 1 percentage point of revenue growth.\n\nIBM expects to generate free cash flow of $13.5 billion this year, up from $12.7 billion in 2024. Based on the current market capitalization, IBM stock trades for roughly 17.5 times that free cash flow guidance. The stock isn't a clear-cut bargain, but it's not expensive either.\n\nIBM is far from the fastest-growing tech giant, but the company has returned to consistent and sustainable growth. Revenue growth is accelerating as IBM's bets on hybrid cloud computing and AI pay off, and profit margins are expanding as well. IBM's valuation isn't as attractive as it was a year ago, but even at an all-time high, long-term investors should seriously consider adding IBM to their portfolios.",

            "content": "International Business Machines (IBM 0.50%) has found an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy that works. While the tech giant is an AI pioneer, monetizing the technology has been a challenge over the past decade. The company's most notable failure was an attempt to leverage AI to transform the healthcare industry. After spending billions on acquisitions to fuel the effort, IBM eventually abandoned the business a few years ago with little to show for it.\n\nToday, IBM has settled into a role of enabling other enterprises to train, deploy, and manage AI models and agents. Through its watsonx AI software platform and its consulting arm, IBM offers a wide range of AI-related services that resonate with its client base.\n\nWhen IBM reported its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, the company noted a big acceleration in its generative AI business. IBM won nearly $2 billion worth of new AI business during the quarter, pushing the cumulative total to $5 billion.\n\nBenefiting from disruption\n\nThe big news in the AI industry in recent weeks has been the revelation that Chinese start-up DeepSeek had managed to train a generative AI model that's capable of matching the performance of top-tier models from U.S. companies like OpenAI for a fraction of the cost. Not only did the model cost very little to train, but it's dramatically cheaper to run as well.\n\nThis development throws into question a lot of the assumptions that are driving mega-investments in AI infrastructure and booming demand for powerful AI accelerators. If powerful AI models can truly be trained cheaply and run on less powerful hardware, the AI industry is in for a massive and unpredictable shakeup.\n\nIBM is not in the business of developing expensive, general-purpose AI models like some of its peers. Instead, the company provides a platform, expertise, implementation, and other services to help clients apply generative AI to real-world use cases. IBM's Granite family of AI models are small and cheap, designed for specific purposes. IBM's watsonx platform also supports AI models from other providers, giving customers a wide range of options.\n\nFor IBM, cheap and plentiful AI is a good thing, because fast models running on cheap hardware will likely expand the market for AI. Enterprises that were turned off by the cost of running the most capable AI models may give the technology a second look. If the ongoing cost of deploying a customer service AI bot were to drop tenfold, demand for all the services and software required to get it up and running could soar.\n\nOne important thing to know about IBM's AI strategy is that it's cloud agnostic. Clients can run watsonx on IBM's cloud, but they can also deploy the platform on AWS, Azure, or their own hardware. IBM's consulting arm, through strategic partnerships with cloud providers, can construct solutions for clients that are already committed to AWS or Azure. This openness to competing cloud platforms makes IBM a far more attractive choice for enterprises looking to deploy AI-powered applications and agents.\n\nBuy this enterprise AI leader\n\nIBM does a lot more than AI, and its growth in 2024 was driven by multiple lines of business. IBM's software segment grew revenue by 9% last year, adjusted for currency, with strong growth for transaction processing, Red Hat, and automation. Most of IBM's AI bookings come from consulting signings, although the company has surpassed $1 billion in bookings for AI software.\n\nIn 2025, AI will be one of many growth drivers as the company aims to accelerate its revenue growth. IBM expects to grow total revenue adjusted for currency by at least 5% this year, up from 3% in 2024. IBM is also predicting free cash flow of around $13.5 billion in 2025, up from $12.7 billion last year.\n\nThe era of cheap and powerful AI could very well be upon us, and IBM is poised to benefit. The company's AI business is accelerating, and as the cost to deploy and run capable AI applications plunges, demand for IBM's AI software and services could soar. While there's a lot of uncertainty in the AI industry right now, IBM looks likely to emerge as a big winner.",

            "content": "Unlike traditional methods of computation that rely on a Binary language, Quantum computers look to leverage quantum bits or \u2018qubits' instead. Unlike Binary, which is built atop 0 and 1, qubits can be superimposed \u2013 meaning they can exist simultaneously as 0 and 1, or anywhere in between. The result is a system that is able to perform certain types of computation at speeds magnitudes quicker than more traditional approaches. The ability to process vast amounts of data and solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers is a key reason why Quantum computing is so important. Their unmatched performance means that such systems boast massive potential for advancements in fields like medicine, environmental science, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. Before its potential can be realized, there are a few significant hurdles that must first be cleared; namely, quantum computers are extremely sensitive to environmental changes (making them error-prone) in addition to only being effective for specific algorithms. With that in mind, the following are a few publicly traded companies leading the way in the research and development of this game-changing approach to computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a notable name that has made significant breakthroughs in quantum computing over the years. For example, by using its \u2018127-qubit Eagle quantum computer', IBM has been able to solve complex problems that long stumped the leading classical methods. Despite the challenges of noise and errors in quantum systems, IBM was able to generate accurate results by using an \u2018advanced error mitigation' technique that were verified by running the problem on a traditional supercomputer for lower levels of complexity.\n\nIn the time since its Eagle quantum computer was released, IBM has already developed a 433 qubit system known as \u2018Osprey' and is expected to soon launch a 1,121 qubit system known as Condor. Each of these successive generations greatly improves upon its predecessor while widening the gap between what is possible with a traditional supercomputer. IBM states that,\n\n\u201cAs quantum processors scale up, each additional qubit doubles the amount of space complexity \u2014 the amount of memory space required to execute algorithms \u2014 for a classical computer to reliably simulate quantum circuits.\u201d\n\nWhile the potential abilities of a quantum computer cannot be replicated by more traditional approaches, IBM notes that it does not envision a future where only one exists. Rather, the company anticipates that both quantum and binary variants will continue to thrive in use cases geared specifically toward the strengths of each.\n\nLooking forward, IBM has already announced its next major goal in anticipation of its current quantum chips \u2018outgrowing' the currently used infrastructure. This goal is known as \u2018IBM Quantum System Two'; a modular system that has the potential to support up to 16,632 qubits.\n\nIBM Quantum System Two: Design Sneak Preview\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $116.85B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 65.7\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $1.97\n\nAt the time of writing, IBM boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nIntel is a pioneer in silicon transistors for traditional computing. Whether a desktop or laptop, the chances are good that, regardless of PC form factor, you have utilized a computer powered by an Intel chip.\n\nAs we make our way through 2023, Intel has forged a clear, yet divergent, strategy for the future that involves quantum computing. Drawing upon its existing expertise, Intel is leveraging its expertise in high-volume transistor manufacturing to develop silicon spin qubits. For example, Intel has developed what it calls the \u2018Horse Ridge II cryogenic quantum control chip' that is said to enhance integration, while its \u2018cryoprobers' allow for high-volume testing.\n\nWorking alongside other companies determined to develop commercialized quantum computers, Intel is also doing its part to help. Currently, Intel boasts the \u2018Tunnel Falls' spin qubit chip as its most advanced offering to date and is, \u201c\u2026making the chip available to the quantum research community to spur advancements in the field.\u201d\n\nIntel Quantum Researchers Introduce Tunnel Falls Silicon Qubit Research Chip\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $138.89B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): -157.14\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.68\n\nAt the time of writing, Intel boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nOperating out of Santa Barbara is \u2018Quantum AI' \u2013 an endeavor by Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google. The goal of Quantum AI is to, \u201c\u2026build scalable quantum computers that enable humankind to solve problems that would otherwise be impossible.\u201d\n\nBeyond developing the hardware, like the Sycamore processor, for its own take on a quantum computer, Google's Quantum AI also makes available a suite of software designed to assist scientists in the development of quantum algorithms.\n\nDemonstrating Quantum Error Correction\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $1.54T\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 22.74\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $4.49\n\nAt the time of writing, Alphabet boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nThe quantum computing division at Honeywell is a joint effort known as \u2018Quantinuum', which also involves Cambridge Quantum.\n\nIt is believed that Quantinuum continues to focus on increasing our understanding of \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'. This technology involves utilizing ions trapped in a vacuum, which are then manipulated using lasers, allowing for the ions to behave as qubits.\n\nLike each of the companies listed above, Quantinuum is hoping that its design will allow for high precision, while simultaneously boasting error-correction capabilities \u2013 each crucial if quantum computers are ever to become commercially viable.\n\nIntroducing Quantinuum\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nMarket Cap: $132.79B\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 21.84\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $7.70\n\nAt the time of writing, Honeywell boasted the above metrics and is listed as a \u2018Strong Buy' among most major investment firms.\n\nWhile it may not have the same name recognition as IBM, Intel, and Alphabet, IonQ has still managed to establish itself as a significant player in the field of quantum computing.\n\nIonQ is known specifically for its research on \u2018trapped ion quantum computing'.

            "content": "IBM Reports Mixed Q4 2024 Earnings Results Despite beating EPS expectations, IBM's revenue miss leads to stock decline amid market uncertainties.\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) recently reported its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, delivering mixed results as it beat earnings per share (EPS) estimates but narrowly missed revenue forecasts. The tech giant, with a market capitalization of $236 billion, achieved earnings of $3.92 per share, surpassing the expected $3.80. Despite this positive news, IBM's revenue came up short at $17.6 billion, below the predicted $17.62 billion, leading to a 1.08% decline in stock price during after-hours trading.\n\nThe earnings report reflects IBM's solid financial management amid challenging macroeconomic conditions. Throughout 2024, the company generated $63 billion in revenue, marking a 3% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven partially by impressive free cash flow, which hit record levels at $12.7 billion for the year. According to Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Chief Financial Officer, \"We are pleased with these results, delivering durable revenue growth and free cash flow performance, exceeding our expectations on profitability.\"\n\nLooking at specific performance metrics, IBM\u2019s operating pre-tax income for the quarter was reported at $11.2 billion, contributing to its operating EPS of $10.33, which was also up 1% year-over-year. These results reaffirm IBM's longstanding reputation for stability, as the company has managed to maintain its dividend payments consistently for 55 consecutive years, boasting a current yield of 2.59%.\n\nDespite these successes, IBM's stock traded at levels lower than anticipated post-earnings, closing at approximately $258.27. This decline has raised eyebrows among investors, particularly as the company's shares remain on the cusp of their 52-week high of $261.80. Analysts have highlighted technical indicators reflecting overbought conditions, with some cautioning about potential price consolidations.\n\nInvestor sentiment might also be influenced by broader market volatility, particularly affecting tech stocks. Amidst rising interest rates and uncertainties stemming from geopolitical tensions, IBM's recent stock performance reflects these broader economic fears, as pointed out by analysts reviewing the earnings report.\n\nIBM\u2019s outlook remains cautiously optimistic, with projections indicating over 5% revenue growth for the company in 2025. The executives have expressed confidence primarily driven by their advancements and market share within the hybrid cloud and generative AI sectors. Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s CEO, stated during the earnings call, \"Software is the basis for all of those capabilities,\" highlighting the company's pivot to become more software-driven as it looks to expand its footprint across these growing areas.\n\nThe tech giant plans to bolster its position by focusing on key segments. The consulting division, for example, should benefit from growing demand for AI-centric services and digital transformation initiatives from clients. Kavanaugh explained, \"We're optimistic about how our consulting services will be leveraged by clients aiming for operational efficiency and modernization.\" This signals to the market IBM's commitment to adapting to changing client priorities and tech industry trends.\n\nAlongside the positive outlook, IBM's free cash flow is expected to rise to $13.5 billion by the end of 2025, offering additional financial flexibility for investments and dividends. Analysts foresee notable growth contributions from both Red Hat, anticipated to achieve mid-teens growth, and overall software revenue growth nearing double digits.\n\nAnalysts have responded to IBM's earnings with varied ratings, reflecting the mixed sentiment surrounding its stock. Bank of America upgraded its target price to $270, touting IBM's growth potential, whereas others like StockNews.com have downgraded the stock's rating to 'hold'. This mixed analyst view mirrors the sentiment on Wall Street, where roughly 58.96% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors, showcasing continued interest in IBM's prospects.\n\nLooking forward, IBM aims to tackle challenges related to geopolitical uncertainty and increased competition in the AI and cloud sectors, striving to refine its strategy to maintain its competitive advantage. Also, Kavanaugh acknowledged potential risks from interest rate fluctuations and supply chain concerns affecting product delivery. He stated, \"These macroeconomic conditions create headwinds for businesses worldwide, but technology remains key to driving sustainable growth.\"\n\nThe company's investments and strategic initiatives will be pivotal as IBM seeks to navigate the coming year and solidify its market position following this earnings report. With analysts and investors keeping close tabs on how IBM will execute its strategies and address market demands, the spotlight remains firmly on how it will adjust to both challenges and opportunities as 2025 approaches.",

So I think what that implies for us is that we think reasonable deals have a very good chance of getting through in a reasonable amount of time and not being held up for years.\"\n\nIBM's acquisition of Hashicorp was first announced in April, intended as a way for Red Hat's Ansible Automation Platform's configuration management and Terraform's automation to \"simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments.\"\n\nDon't miss this analysis: IBM takes the patient path to future gen-AI profits\n\nThe deal has since been held up on both sides of the pond, with the US FTC opening an antitrust review in July and the UK's CMA launching an inquiry into the proposed transaction last month.\n\nIn expectation of a friendlier business approach from regulators, Krishna said with that in mind, \"we are going to lean in more, which is reasonable.

We certainly hope that with a friendlier environment, that gets done soon and that then begins to open up the aperture for getting more deals done.

CEO Antonio Neri told The Register late last year that he expected the $14 billion purchase of Juniper Networks to be completed late in 2024 or early in 2025.\n\nJust yesterday, however, the Justice Department \u2013 which was already examining the transaction's implications \u2013 said it would \"eliminate fierce head-to-head competition between the companies, raise prices, reduce innovation, and diminish choice for scores of American businesses and institutions.\"\n\nIt has sued to block the marriage between HPE and Juniper, the second and third biggest providers of wireless local area networks in the US, filing a complaint in the Northern District of California.\n\nHashicorp doesn't command the same market share as Juniper Networks in its sector, and no such legal action has het been launched. With a multi-billion war chest at its disposal, IBM will be keeping a watchful eye on the case.",

            "content": "When IBM said it would be unfreezing its defined benefit plan, speculation swirled about whether this signaled the resurgence of traditional pensions. Then there was silence.\n\nNo, 2024 didn\u2019t usher in a return of corporate pension plans. But industry insiders now see a notable uptick in corporate interest \u2014 driven by plans that are well funded, employee demand, and a renewed focus from employers on retirement readiness.\n\n\u201cThe rumors of defined benefit\u2019s death have been greatly exaggerated for years,\u201d WTW\u2019s CEO Carl Hess told Institutional Investor. \u201cInterest is definitely there. Action, as usual with pensions, is slow. But we have seen movement with a number of plan sponsors.\u201d\n\nCompanies began moving from traditional pension plans in the early 1980s, shifting retirement savings risk to employees through defined contribution plans like 401(k) accounts. In 1975, pensions represented 32 percent of all retirement plans. By 2023, only 15 percent of private-sector nonunion workers had a defined benefit plan. Meanwhile, private industry workers with access to a 401(k) had grown to 67 percent.\n\nBut sentiment has shifted since IBM replaced its 401(k) match with a traditional pension in early 2024. More companies have begun to assess the viability of either resurrecting their frozen pensions or offering a new one to employees. Hess said that WTW has recently \u201cbeen having conversations with around 100 plan sponsors about DB.\u201d\n\nIBM, one of the largest U.S. DB plan sponsors, made headlines in late 2023 when it announced plans to reopen its pension, which had been frozen since 2008. For about a decade, the company contributed 5 percent to employees\u2019 401(k) accounts. But in January 2024, the company began depositing that contribution into a cash balance plan within its overfunded pension system, effectively reviving the defined benefit plan. The move allows IBM to tap into its $3.5 billion pension surplus, cutting costs and eliminating annual cash outflows to the 401(k).\n\nA major reason for the renewed interest is that funding ratios, a measure of financial health, for U.S. corporate pensions are the highest they\u2019ve been in 16 years. In fact, IBM reopened its plan to use its surplus to fund retirement contributions. Other companies are weighing whether surplus pension assets could be repurposed to strengthen benefits, whether through reopening plans or increasing contributions to 401(k) plans. \u201cIf the frozen plan is overfunded, then somebody may reopen it for little or no cash,\u201d said John Lowell of October Three Consulting.\n\nEmployees backed by unions are also bringing the issue to the fore, as demonstrated by unionized workers at Boeing pushing for a pension and Southwest Airlines establishing a cash balance plan for its pilot\u2019s union (while failing to get a DB plan, Boeing\u2019s employees managed to secure a boosted 401(k) match from the airline).\n\nMatt McDaniel, a partner at Mercer, noted that \u201cif the union has a strong bargaining position, then there\u2019s been some willingness\u201d for the employer to reconsider a DB plan.\n\nSupport for pensions remains high, with survey data from the National Institute on Retirement Security showing that 82 percent of Americans believing all workers should have access to a pension, while 65 percent think pensions are better than 401(k) plans for ensuring retirement security.\n\nAccording to McDaniel, this employee demand has led some \u201cenlightened plan sponsors focused on retirement readiness and retirement adequacy\u201d for their employees to look into how to best to serve their employees\u2019 retirement savings needs. These plan sponsors remain interested in maintaining DB plans or exploring risk-sharing structures like variable annuity plans. \u201cSome plan sponsors are content [with] a 401K, but others look at it a little more holistically,\u201d he said. \u201cA DB structure can allow a more orderly succession plan within a business.\u201d\n\nThe conversation around DB plans has also evolved as employees gain a better understanding of longevity risk and income security. \u201cOne of the greatest fears that workers have is outliving their wealth, if they have any wealth,\u201d Lowell said. \u201cThe defined benefit plan is an efficient way to do this because there\u2019s not an insurer in the middle.\u201d As Mercer\u2019s McDaniel put it, \u201cDB plans are a more efficient vehicle for providing lifetime income because of the way they pool longevity risk. Dollar for dollar, it\u2019s better than a DC plan.\u201d\n\nHess and McDaniel both noted that hybrid designs like cash balance plans or variable annuity plans could also gain traction, since they can offer some risk management that DC plans can\u2019t.\n\nWhile IBM\u2019s decision to unfreeze its pension plan loosened the ketchup bottle, the industry shouldn\u2019t expect an avalanche of new DB plans in the next year. \u201cNo one changes their plan overnight,\u201d WTW\u2019s Hess said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of due diligence that needs to be done.\u201d\n\nThe landscape for retirement benefits is shifting \u2014 perhaps not in a wholesale return to traditional pensions, but in a way that reflects a deeper understanding of the challenges employees face in securing a reliable income for life. Whether this translates into a true comeback for DB plans remains to be seen, but the conversation is certainly no longer off the table.\n\n\u201cI think there are going to be more of them than what we anticipated five years ago,\u201d Lowell said. \u201cThat said, I don\u2019t think every kid on the block is going to put one in. But for a variety of reasons, some are looking into it.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "NEW YORK -- Tesla, IBM and Meta Platforms helped lead most U.S. stocks higher on Thursday after a rush of profit reports from some of the country's most influential companies.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5%, as four out of every five stocks in the index climbed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 168 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.3%.\n\nMeta Platforms helped push indexes higher after rising 1.6%. The company behind Facebook and Instagram delivered a better profit for the end of 2024 than analysts expected. Perhaps just as importantly for the market, it also talked up its artificial intelligence efforts and said it will continue to invest in the space.\n\nThat calmed some of the worries created by a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, when it said it developed a large language model capable of competing with the world's best, without having to use top-flight chips.\n\nThat raised questions about whether all the investment expected for AI chips, data centers and electricity is really needed and sent a shock through markets at the start of the week.\n\nThe AI boom has been a primary reason for the U.S. stock market's run to repeated records in recent years, and the threat has hit stocks like Nvidia particularly hard. The chip company that's become the symbol of the AI frenzy spent most of Thursday lower, but it ended with a gain of 1% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft shares fell 6.2%, keeping indexes in check.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based software giant topped analysts' expectations for profit in the latest quarter, but the focus was instead on the slower than expected growth in its cloud computing business, which is a centerpiece of its AI efforts.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella also continued to talk up AI after DeepSeek's disruption.\n\n\"DeepSeek had some real innovations,\" he said, and it is good to have efficiency gains and lower prices in AI development because it \"means people can consume more and there'll be more apps written.\"\n\nThe pressure is on companies to keep delivering stronger profits. That would help them offset the downward force their stock prices have felt from climbing yields in the bond market recently. When bonds are paying more in interest, investors aren't as willing to pay high prices for stocks.\n\nThe report showed a \"Goldilocks\" economy at the turn of the year, one that was neither too hot nor too cold, according to Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. But he warned many uncertainties from Washington could change things, including what it does with income tax rates, tariffs and immigration.\n\nYields felt some downward pressure after the European Central Bank cut its main interest rate in hopes of boosting the region's stagnant economy.\n\nIn Washington, the Federal Reserve had also been cutting its main rate since September to help the U.S. economy, but it opted to hold steady on Wednesday.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said it likely needs to see more evidence of a slowdown either in inflation or in the U.S. job market to lower rates further.\n\nOn Wall Street, Tesla shares rose 2.9% even though Elon Musk's electric vehicle company reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nMusk asserted Tesla will offer unsupervised \"full self-driving\" technology to its customers as a paid service starting in Austin in June.\n\nIBM shares rallied 13% after beating analysts' expectations for profit.\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna pointed to its growing book of generative AI business and said IBM expects its overall revenue to grow at least 5% this year.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 gained 31.86 points to 6,071.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.61 to 44,882.13 and the Nasdaq composite added 49.43 to 19,681.75.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott of The Associated Press.\n\nA sign outside the New York Stock Exchange marks the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in New York.

(NYSE:IBM)\n\nInternational Business Machines saw a 12.96-percent jump in its share prices on Thursday to end at $258.27 each as investors took heart from the company\u2019s strong earnings performance last year coupled with an optimistic outlook for 2025.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, International Business Machines said revenues rose by 1 percent to $17.6 billion, with growth owed to a 10 percent growth in revenues from its software segment.\n\nFor the fourth quarter alone, earnings per share stood at $3.92, better than the $3.80 as projected by analysts.\n\nFor 2025, International Business Machines said it targets to grow its revenues by at least 5 percent and a free cash flow of $13.5 billion. The expansion rate would be above the 3 percent uptick logged in 2024, which analysts noted was a sign of IBM's confidence in its AI and cloud strategy.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 5th on our list of Thursday's top gainers. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "This past year underscored exactly what only a place like IBM can achieve. At IBM Research, we made massive advances in AI, quantum computing, semiconductors, and fundamental research \u2014 much of which is either heading into products solving real problems IBM customers have, or will be in the near future.\n\nIBM Research houses some 3,000 researchers in 12 labs across the world. By pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in such a wide range of scientific fields, we\u2019re able to envision what\u2019s next in computing and scale our ideas in ways that previously may have seemed impossible. Whether that\u2019s revolutionizing the next generation of IBM mainframes with new chips and networking solutions, building AI models and agents that are solving real problems IBM Consulting clients have, or tackling intractable, fundamental problems through cutting-edge quantum supercomputing.\n\nIn this letter, we\u2019ll highlight the major breakthroughs that came out of IBM Research over just the last 12 months. But as important as these innovations are individually, it\u2019s what they represent when taken together. Our engine of research and development across our labs is leading to commercial products for IBM, and meaningful results for our partners and clients \u2014 faster than ever before.\n\nAI\n\nWe have all seen how quickly AI has become integral to so many aspects of our lives. In a few short years, just about every piece of public data available on the internet has been used to train a foundation model. And yet, much of the world\u2019s enterprise data \u2014 information that can be used to build tools to solve real business needs \u2014 remains locked in PDFs, slide decks, emails, and spreadsheets. Over the course of 2024, IBM Research was the engine of innovation behind IBM\u2019s largest releases that are now bringing AI to enterprise, at the scale needed when end users measure in the millions.\n\nAt Think in May, IBM and Red Hat unveiled InstructLab, a new open-source project designed to lower the cost of fine-tuning LLMs, by allowing people to collaboratively add new knowledge and skills to any model. This project was conceived of and incubated within IBM Research, and a close working relationship between Research and Red Hat led to the powerful tool that has now launched on Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI. What makes InstructLab so impressive is that it gives communities the tools to create and merge changes to LLMs, without having to retrain the model from scratch. By making LLMs more like any other open-source software project, it\u2019s considerably easier for collaborators from around the world to find new ways to make LLMs solve problems that people are struggling to solve. IBM Research has used InstructLab to generate synthetic data to improve its open-source Granite models for language and code. In October, IBM launched and open-sourced its third generation of Granite models.\n\nThese powerful new enterprise models were designed and trained within IBM Research\u2019s Data and Model Factory. The release included the new Granite 8B and 2B models, designed to be the workhorse models for enterprise AI. These models were trained on 12 trillion tokens in 12 languages, from a combination of public and enterprise data sources. The models perform at the same level as considerably larger foundation models, at a fraction of the cost, on tasks that are important to businesses \u2014 things like RAG, classification, summarization, entity extraction, and tool use.\n\nSubsequently in December, we released our Granite 3.1 models, each with an expanded context length of 128K. They were trained on more than 12 trillion tokens of high-quality, curated data, and open-sourced with full transparency on data sources. The Granite 3.1 8B Instruct model delivered significant performance improvements over Granite 3.0, and its average score across the Hugging Face OpenLLM Leaderboard benchmarks is among the highest of any open model in its weight class.\n\nWe also released a new family of embedding models. These new models, like their generative counterparts, offer multilingual support in 12 languages.\n\nAs part of the earlier Granite 3.0 launch, we also open-sourced a new family of models called Granite Guardian. These let developers implement safety guardrails to their apps, by checking user prompts and LLM responses for several types of risks, including social bias, hate, toxicity, profanity, violence, and jailbreaking attempts. And when our models are coupled with RAG, they can check for groundedness, context relevance, and answer relevance. We released a new 8B version with Granite 3.1 that we believe offers the most comprehensive set of risk and harm detection capabilities available today.\n\nWe also announced new versions of our Granite Time Series models, which outperform models 10 times their size. For businesses, being able to accurately forecast future events based on historical data can have major impacts. Traditional LLMs struggle with these sorts of tasks, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve pursued these models. This includes Granite TTM (or TinyTimeMixers), IBM\u2019s series of compact and high performing time-series models, which are now available in watsonx.ai through the beta release of watsonx.ai Timeseries Forecasting API and SDK. We believe the open-source community has seen the value in these models, with TTM having been downloaded on Hugging Face more than 5 million times so far.\n\nAlso in October, we released the next generation of watsonx Code Assistant. Powered by Granite code models, wCA offers general-purpose coding help for languages like C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. In our own software development pipeline, we\u2019ve improved our speed with code explanation by 90% in some cases. The new 8B code model also features support for agentic capabilities. Our Granite code models are also powering new use cases in IT, business, and industry 4.0 automation, through products like Instana, watsonx Orchestrate, and Maximo.\n\nIn addition to their open-source release on Hugging Face, and commercial availability on watsonx and Red Hat products, Granite models are now available across a wide swathe of partners including Ollama, LM Studio, AWS, Nvidia, Google Vertex, and Samsung, among others.\n\nBuilding off the Granite 3 series of models, we\u2019re now working to realize a future where AI agents can easily solve business needs. We have released an open-source framework called Bee that enables rapid development of agents to power business applications. These new lightweight models are small enough to be deployed on a laptop or other edge devices.\n\nWe also made new models that our partners are already using to make a difference in the world. Our climate and weather model, developed in partnership with NASA, is now being used to track the flood damage in Spain, deforestation in the Amazon, and heat islands in US cities.\n\nThis year also marked the one-year anniversary of the AI Alliance, a group co-founded by IBM and Meta to drive open and responsible AI development. Over the last year, it\u2019s grown to 140 members in 23 countries, including the likes of AMD, Cleveland Clinic, Intel, Anyscale, UPenn, Hugging Face, and Yale. The organization has formed several working groups to develop responsible and accessible foundation models, AI hardware, and safety initiatives.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nWith the burgeoning demand for AI, which has become reliant on increasingly complex models, it\u2019s clear that traditional CPUs and GPUs are struggling to provide the necessary combination of speed and energy efficiency. We need to create new devices that were designed from the outset to handle AI workloads at scale. This has been a large part of the focus of the semiconductors and infrastructure research teams in 2024, with several major breakthroughs taking place.\n\nIn August, IBM unveiled Spyre, a new AI accelerator chip for future generations of Z and Power systems. Spyre was inspired by the work out of IBM Research on the AIU prototype design, first shown off in 2022, and the Telum chip from 2021. In each case, researchers had taken inspiration from the structure of the human brain, to create devices where both CPU and AI cores were tightly integrated on the same chip. This breakthrough came after the realization that AI workflows require a system with extremely low latency for AI inferencing.\n\nSpyre has 32 individual accelerator cores and contains 25.6 billion transistors connected by 14 miles of wire. It is produced using 5 nm node process technology, and cards can be clustered together. A cluster of eight cards adds 256 additional accelerator cores to a single IBM Z system.\n\nRoughly 70% of the entire world\u2019s transactions by value run through IBM mainframes. With Spyre, there\u2019s now an effective solution for bringing generative AI to these mission-critical machines. Every day, new enterprise use cases for generative AI are springing up, from solutions for automating business processes, to generative systems for app modernization. With the Spyre Accelerator, businesses can deploy cutting-edge AI software on Z, while still benefiting from the security and reliability IBM Z offers.\n\nOne of the prototype NorthPole devices used in the large language model experiments.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at new ways to serve models more efficiently. Last year, IBM Research unveiled its brain-inspired AIU NorthPole chip, which co-locates memory and processing units together, effectively removing the von Neumann bottleneck found in just about every chip design over the past 60 years. This year, in a collaboration between NorthPole\u2019s hardware researchers and AI researchers, the team created a new research system using NorthPole for generative models.\n\nNorthPole's efficiency compared with other devices with similar uses.\n\nThe team took 16 IBM NorthPole chips, installed them on a standard server blade, and ran a 3-billion parameter LLM. The team was able to achieve a latency of below 1 millisecond per token \u2014 nearly 47 times faster than the next most energy-efficient GPU \u2014 while using nearly 73 times less energy than the next lowest-latency GPU.\n\nA similar sort of cross-collaboration resulted in another major breakthrough this year in the field of co-packaged optics. A team within IBM Research\u2019s semiconductors division produced the world\u2019s first successful polymer optical waveguide, which brings the bandwidth of optics to the very edge of chips. This device makes it possible to line up high-density bundles of optical fibers at the edge of a silicon chip, so it can communicate directly through the polymer fibers. High-fidelity optical connections require exacting tolerances of half a micron or less between a fiber and connector. The team has demonstrated the viability of a 50-micron pitch for optical channels. This represents an 80% size reduction from the conventional 250-micron pitch, which they believe can shrink even further, to 20 or 25 microns, leading to a 1,000% to 1,200% increase in bandwidth for a given chip. which brings the bandwidth of optics to the very edge of chips.\n\nIBM Research's co-packaged optics device breakthrough.\n\nAgain working with Research\u2019s AI division, the team used these new prototype devices to calculate that it would be possible to cut the time it takes to train a 70 billion parameter LLM from three months to three weeks, when compared to using industry-standard GPUs and interconnects. That would save the energy equivalent of 5,000 U.S. homes\u2019 annual power consumption per AI model trained.\n\nThe semiconductors team has also continued its breakthrough work in shrinking transistors and delivering 2 nm process devices with Rapidus in the next five years. Researchers from IBM and Japanese chipmaker Rapidus have announced that they reached a critical milestone in consistently constructing chips with a 2-nanometer process. Using selective nanosheet layer reduction, they can now build nanosheet gate-all-around transistors with multiple threshold voltages (or multi-Vt), which allows for chips that can perform complex computations without requiring as much energy. These advances further strengthen the nanosheet multi-Vt technology as the replacement for current FinFET devices.\n\nThe team also has been focused on research and development of EUV lithography using High NA EUV systems \u2014 a critical technology that allows for designing high-performance logic devices with the potential to extend the Nanosheet era and enable future vertically-stacked transistors beyond the 1 nm node.\n\nIBM has already achieved an early demonstration of metallization of lines down to 21 nm pitch that enables the continuation of copper damascene interconnects integration, unlocking the needs of semiconductor designs below the 2 nm node and simplifying future Nanosheet node technology. The single-print 24, 23, and 21 nm pitch interconnects have demonstrable and consistent electrical functionality. This demonstrates that IBM\u2019s development platform can continue to leverage further process co-optimization to enable mature yields in these smallest of wires.\n\nResearchers in Albany testing out chip designs on the EUV lithography machines.\n\nThese breakthroughs are impressive in their own right, but perhaps what\u2019s most impactful is that these projects will not just remain as research endeavors. Through the reach of IBM and its partners, we\u2019re already seeing these devices grow from ideas into products that can be deployed at scale to help solve real business problems. IBM Spyre is already available and will be integral to the next generation of IBM Power 11 when it is released later in 2025. AIU NorthPole and the co-packaged optics devices were tested and hardened at IBM\u2019s facility in Bromont, Canada, where countless companies rely on the site\u2019s services to test and package their chips. And IBM Research\u2019s 2 nm node technology is now being made ready for large-scale production with Rapidus.\n\nQuantum\n\nIn 2024, we made great strides advancing our mission of bringing useful quantum computing to the world. A big part of that was solidifying our vision for quantum-centric supercomputing \u2014 weaving quantum and classical computing together to solve problems beyond the ability of either compute paradigm alone \u2014 and turbocharging the performance of Qiskit, the world\u2019s favorite quantum software development kit.\n\nBack in 2020, IBM released an aggressive roadmap charting the course for scaling quantum computers. Last year we extended that roadmap out to 2033, detailing the hardware, software, and innovations we have planned to realize fault-tolerant quantum computing at scale. At this year\u2019s Quantum Developer Conference, we demonstrated our progress \u2014 including the achievement of accurate results from quantum circuits on Heron out to 5,000 gate operations.\n\nThe latest IBM Quantum Heron chip.\n\nWe unveiled a more performant Heron chip, now with 156 qubits, for our clients. Heron is shattering records for performance with superconducting quantum processors, with error rates continuing to fall. Heron\u2019s best 2Q gate error rates are now 8x10^-4, as measured by Randomized Benchmarking. We also now have achieved a 240 times improvement in speed in two years, now at 240K circuit layer operations per second (CLOPS).\n\nWe also achieved two critical milestones on tour innovation roadmap: m-couplers with Crossbill and l-couplers with Flamingo. Crossbill\u2019s m-couplers are short-range chip-to-chip couplers that allow us to scale chips within packages modularly. Our Flamingo demonstration introduced l-couplers, longer-range package-to-package couplers that allow us to link chips over larger distances inside the fridge. Together, these advances provide new technologies aligned to our roadmap goals of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computers with Starling and Bluejay.\n\nBut perhaps the most significant release of the year was the first stable version of Qiskit SDK, Qiskit v1.0. Based on the results of our benchmarking, we feel confident in saying that it\u2019s the world\u2019s most performant quantum software development kit.\n\nA formal shift to semantic versioning with longer support cycles, coupled with a removal of the metapackage architecture, offers the stability that Qiskit\u2019s more than 600,000 developers need to build more complex algorithms and map their most difficult challenges to quantum circuits. And a new algorithm for transpiling circuits, called LightSABRE brings significant improvements over the previous SABRE algorithm.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to show its performance in a fair and accurate way. We compiled and released an open-source collection of benchmarks called Benchpress, comprising over 1,000 different tests to measure a quantum SDK\u2019s ability to generate, manipulate, and transpile circuits. Almost all these tests are standardized benchmarking tests from open-source libraries used by other members of the quantum community. We benchmarked Qiskit against other quantum software, including TKET, BQSKit, Cirq, and more. Qiskit was the clear winner in terms of performance, completing more tests than any other quantum SDK. On average, Qiskit was 29 times faster at transpiling and transpiled the circuits with 54% fewer two-qubit gates than TKET, the second highest-performing SDK.\n\nBut Qiskit is more than just a performant SDK. This year, we redefined Qiskit as a software toolset to work alongside our quantum computing hardware, taking users through the entire journey of running utility-scale quantum workloads from writing code to post-processing the results and everything in between. Today, Qiskit encompasses both the open-source SDK, as well as the software and middleware tools necessary for executing utility-scale workloads. That includes the new Qiskit Transpiler Service, the updated Qiskit Runtime Service featuring an overhaul of the Qiskit Primitives, our new Qiskit AI Code Assistant Service, Qiskit Serverless, and Qiskit Functions, an IBM-hosted instantiation of Qiskit Serverless for running workloads on IBM quantum processors and IBM Cloud.\n\nOf those new features, Qiskit Functions has the potential to bring quantum computing to a considerably broader audience. It\u2019s a new programming service we designed that enables access to high-performance quantum hardware and software at a higher abstraction level. After importing the Qiskit Function Catalog and passing it their API token, users add the function to their code and pass it the required inputs \u2014 such as classical data they\u2019d like to map and run on quantum circuits. The service runs the code on a quantum computer and applies error suppression and mitigation, then the user receives their results.\n\nCombining these software and hardware breakthroughs allowed us this year to produce the first true demonstration of quantum-centric supercomputing. Working with RIKEN, we published a new paper where we defined the paradigm as supercomputing that optimizes and orchestrates work across quantum computers and advanced classical compute clusters, either co-located or over the cloud, to accelerate both.\n\nIn that paper, the RIKEN and IBM team incorporated quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6,400 nodes of the Fugaku supercomputer to assist an IBM Heron QPU. The computation was a simulation of the triple-bond breaking of molecular nitrogen, plus the active-space electronic structure of two iron-sulfur clusters, 2Fe\u20132S and 4Fe\u20134S. Together, the computers produced approximate solutions for problems beyond exact classical methods by incorporating the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method now included in Qiskit as an add-on.\n\nAn IBM Quantum System Two in the Think Lab at IBM Research, among other computing clusters, is part of a vision for quantum-centric supercomputing.\n\nAs quantum-centric supercomputing comes to fruition, we envision quantum computers will assist classical computers (and vice versa) in some of the hardest computing tasks. And we believe our development roadmap will push us toward that future. And, as we said at the SC2024 conference, we feel confident that we can achieve quantum advantage in the next two years \u2014 if we work together with the classical HPC community.\n\nCurrent cryptographic methods, such as RSA encryption, rely on how difficult it is for computers to factor large numbers into prime factors, which gets more challenging as the numbers get larger. While computer scientists believe classical computers to be practically incapable of factoring numbers larger than 2048 bits, researchers have shown that an advanced quantum computer could break RSA-2048 in a matter of hours by applying Shor\u2019s algorithm.\n\nWith all the recent advances in quantum computing, enterprises and governments alike have begun to prioritize quantum-safe cryptography preparation. A key milestone on this journey was the release of new NIST cryptography standards in the US in August.\n\nTwo of the standards, ML-KEM (derived from CRYSTALS-Kyber) and ML-DSA (derived from CRYSTALS-Dilithium), were developed by IBM Research cryptography researchers in Zurich with external collaborators. And the third, SLH-DSA (derived from SPHINCS+), was co-developed by a scientist who has since joined IBM Research.\n\nIn 2023, NIST started a follow-on standardization process to diversify the toolkit of quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. IBM submitted three new digital signature algorithms, all accepted by NIST for competition. Our new quantum-safe algorithms will provide even broader security for our classical infrastructure in advance of future cryptographically relevant quantum computers.\n\nTo support organizations their the post-quantum future, the IBM Quantum Safe team designed a roadmap for cyber resiliency. The process begins with understanding a company\u2019s cryptographic landscape, what needs to be replaced, and where dependencies are. Enterprises can discover cryptographic artifacts, generate a cryptography bill of materials (or CBOM) for their business applications, and analyze the associated vulnerabilities using IBM Quantum Safe Explorer. IBM Research has also built an open-source CBOM generator and CBOM viewer that generates CBOMs and creates graphic visualizations to enhance the open-source community\u2019s understanding of cryptographic assets in their code.\n\nImpact at a national level\n\nWhen it comes to solving the biggest problems the world is facing, no one company or organization will solve them on their own. It will take collaboration and cooperation, something that nation states can organize. Through 2024, IBM was involved in several major initiatives that are having an impact at a national scale. The success of Rapidus is a critical mission for the nation of Japan, and in 2024, the 2 nm partnership has expanded to include chiplets and advanced packaging, and AI-powered fab automation.\n\nBeyond the major initiative with Rapidus, IBM has been working with several countries to aid them in securing the future of computing in their states.\n\nThe AI system installed at Phoenix Technologies's location in Switzerland. (Courtesy: Phoenix Technologies)\n\nIn Switzerland, we worked with Phoenix, the organization building the Swiss sovereign cloud, to install an end-to-end, on-premises cloud-native AI supercomputer, from the system up through the AI platform and software stack. The architecture can scale from dozens to hundreds or thousands of GPUs. It contains IBM breakthroughs, like a flexible, scalable, and affordable RDMA-enabled Ethernet-based network, and a high-performance storage system based on IBM Storage Scale, one of the industry\u2019s fastest and most flexible file systems. The cloud-native AI platform was built using the OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift AI, with access to watsonx.ai as needed. Our software stack provides tools needed to productively innovate with generative AI. The first phase came online at Phoenix in August and will help power sovereign AI cloud solution, kvant AI, which aims to provide sovereign AI applications for every industry.\n\nWe also strengthen our partnership with the Canadian and Quebecois governments through investments in our Bromont facility, solidifying the future of the chip supply chain in North America by advancing the assembly, testing, and packaging capabilities at this vital IBM plant.\n\nAdditionally in the semiconductor sphere, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the new NSTC EUV Accelerator will be based at the Albany NanoTech Complex, where the biggest breakthroughs in IBM semiconductor research have taken place, including Nanosheet technology, and inventing 2 nm nodes \u2014 the world\u2019s smallest process technology for semiconductors currently being manufactured. And in December, this agreement secured an $825 million federal investment under the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe Albany NanoTech Complex will house the new NSTC EUV Accelerator.\n\nWe\u2019ve worked to expand quantum computing\u2019s reach across the globe as well. We opened the first IBM Quantum Data Center in Europe in October, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in attendance. We also partnered with RIKEN, the Japanese national research laboratory, to install an IBM Quantum System Two at the same location as the Fugaku supercomputer in Kobe. And we\u2019re bringing IBM systems to the republic of Korea, with an IBM Quantum System Two that will be installed alongside an IBM AIU cluster at Korea Quantum Computing, plus we installed the first IBM Quantum System One in the country at Yonsei University in November. We\u2019re also working with President Emmanuel Macron and the French government to invest in quantum technologies in the county.\n\nIn each case, the goal is to expand the quantum community in each region, while fostering a new generation of quantum developers who will grow up in a world where they can call upon quantum computing like any other computing asset to solve pressing issues.\n\nIn AI, we\u2019re also working with nations to ensure their cultures and languages are not left behind in an industry dominated by the English language. We\u2019re working with the Spanish government to build Spanish-language LLMs for the more than 600 million Spanish speakers across the world. We\u2019ve collaborated with the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) to build and open-source ALLaM, a capable Arabic-language LLM. We\u2019ve also worked with the Kenyan government to use IBM and NASA\u2019s geospatial foundation model to carefully monitor their reforestation program efforts.\n\nEighty years of inventing what\u2019s next in computing\n\nWhen Thomas Watson incorporated disparate businesses into IBM in 1924, he saw how automation could reshape the world. Even in those early days of tabulating machines, scales, and punch clocks, the company\u2019s goal was to make products that made work easier. And Watson knew that to continue succeeding as a company, IBM would need to continuously uncover new ideas and design new tools to meet the changing needs of industry.\n\nWatson saw the value in investing in research from the outset. IBM partnered with Columbia University in 1928 to devise new ways to process information. And under the leadership of Columbia professor (and Apollo lunar mission calculator) Wallace Eckert, they founded what would become the predecessor to IBM Research.\n\nThe Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory opened on Columbia\u2019s campus in 1945. Unlike other labs with corporate funding, the goal was to push the boundaries of modern science \u2014 rather than incrementally improve existing products. It was the first corporate research facility in the US focused solely on science. Over time, the lab grew, and IBM set up a dedicated research division in 1956. It soon became clear that they needed a larger space to explore the burgeoning world of computing. That led to the IBM Research headquarters in Yorktown Heights, New York, which we still occupy today.\n\nThe early days of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University.\n\nThis year marks 80 years since those early beginnings of IBM Research. In that time, thousands have come through IBM\u2019s labs to explore fundamental scientific research, which has led to some of the biggest breakthroughs in computing history. Over the years, we have invented the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the scanning tunneling microscope, DRAM, relational databases, RISC, Fortran, and the ATM, to name just a few major breakthroughs. We\u2019ve published more than 110,000 research papers, and our researchers have won six Nobel Prizes, ten Medals of Technology, five National Medals of Science, and six Turing Awards.\n\nThese achievements are worth celebrating as we look towards the next century of progress at IBM, which we will do over the course of 2025. But as we look back over the last 80 years, it\u2019s difficult not to consider the impact we have made as the research division of a major technology company. With a focus on fundamental research, which we can then apply to real products that solve real problems faced by businesses and governments, we can achieve things that academic institutions and research organizations struggle to do on their own.\n\nFrom the outset, all of the work that we\u2019ve carried out throughout our history has been in service of creating the next great computing products for IBM and its clients. This year was no exception. But we believe we\u2019re on the precipice of a computing revolution unlike any we\u2019ve seen since the dawn of the industry.\n\nThe world is changing rapidly, and challenges are getting increasingly complex. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so much in new paradigms like quantum and neuromorphic computing. The traditional way we have used computers to solve problems won\u2019t cut it anymore. What we see coming is a convergence of the bits of classical computing, the neurons of AI systems, and the qubits. Each of these computing paradigms is groundbreaking on its own. But when they complement each other, the results will be even more transformative. It\u2019s the concept of accelerated discovery that IBM Research has pursued in recent years.\n\nIt\u2019s why we built the new Think Lab at our headquarters in Yorktown Heights, New York. An IBM Quantum System Two sits next to a cluster of AIU chips, and when the next version of Z is released, one will be installed in the space as well. We\u2019re starting at home when we think about how we build big things that we believe will shape the future of computing. In our Think Lab, we\u2019ve built a space where researchers can interact with other professionals they may never have encountered before to build things that may have been impossible before. We use our own tools to make our future products better. Our own Granite models are being used for internal agents for HR, IT, and myriad other applications. Our agentic frameworks are being used to build code-building agents for Qiskit. Our AIU cluster was used to help train our Granite models.",

IBM had 288,000 staff at the end of 2023 and no newer numbers are available.\n\nKavanaugh also confirmed: \"We are cutting back on discretionary-based spend, so we can fuel investment into digital transformation and GenAI overall.\" Clients are doing the same thing. \"We've been seeing that play out throughout 2024,\" he added.\n\nDon't miss... this analysis of IBM's generative AI push, over on The Next Platform.\n\nThis is all part of reshaping IBM from the company it was three years ago to where it wants to be now and the requisite skills the corporation anticipates for the near future. This started with the 2021 sale of the infrastructure services biz, now known as Kyndryl.\n\nAs for why the share price rose, IBM reported revenue for Q4 of $17.55 billion, up from the estimated $17.45 billion, and adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.92 versus the consensus of $3.74. Revenue was up 1 percent year-on-year in the quarter and for the full year to $62.8 billion.\n\nNet profit for Q4 was down 11 percent to $2.9 billion and down 20 percent for calendar 2024 to $6 billion. IBM's Software division now accounts for 45 percent of the total revenues, hence higher margins. The profit drop was related to revenue declines in consulting, which also carries high margins.\n\nSoftware revenue was up eight percent year-on-year in the quarter to $7.92 billion, led by Red Hat, Automation, Transaction Processing, Data & AI, and Security, and for the year jumped to $27.08 billion from $25 billion.\n\nConsulting revenue was down two percent to $5.17 billion in Q4 and dipped to $20.69 billion from $20.84 billion in 2024. The CFO said: \"We continue to see clients re-prioritizing their IT spending towards digital transformation and AI initiatives for cost optimization and operational efficiency.\"\n\nOn that note: \"Generative AI contributed about $1.5 billion of new bookings in the quarter as clients see the value our extensive industry and enterprise AI expertise can bring to accelerating their digital transformations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nIt is nearly three years since IBM's last z Series mainframe was released. As such, revenues generated by the Infrastructure division fell eight percent year-on-year for Q4 to $4.24 billion and were down 4 percent in 2024 to $14 billion, \"reflecting product cycle dynamics in our 11th quarter of z16,\" said the CFO.\n\n\"This product cycle has outpaced prior cycles and program-to-date installed MIPS have increased over 30 percent as clients' capacity needs continue to grow. IBM z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving not just hardware adoption, but also the related software, storage, and services.\"\n\nOn the earnings call, CEO Arvind Krishna talked extensively and enthusiastically about AI. No surprises there. \"We continue to gain momentum with our GenAI book of business growing to over $5 billion inception-to-date, up by about $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. Approximately one-fifth of this book of business comes from software and the remaining four-fifths is Consulting,\" he said.\n\n\"Our AI portfolio is tailored to meet the diverse needs of enterprise clients, enabling them to leverage a mix of models, IBM's, their own, open models from Hugging Face, Meta, and Mistral. IBM's Granite models designed for specific purposes are 90 percent more cost-efficient than larger alternatives.\"\n\nHe said RHEL AI and OpenShift AI are giving customers a \"consistent and scalable AI foundation built on open source technology,\" with \"traction also seen on IBM's WatsonX middleware and AI assistance including Watsonx.gov, Watsonx code assistant for Z, [and] Watsonx Orchestrate.\"\n\nOf the business landscape, the CEO said: \"Geopolitical tensions may be on a better track right now, but certainly not solved. Interest rates, inflation, demographics, lack of skilled labor [and] supply chain, I think these issues all carry over into 2025.\n\n\"I would tell you there is more optimism in the business climate and there is more optimism on the growth that is possible in '25 compared to '24. And we know all the reasons for that. Is it pro-innovation, is it pro-growth? Is it pro-regulation, reducing friction? All those things I believe are going to result in a better environment in 2025.\"\n\nOne thing that remains constant with IBM is its ongoing need to reduce costs. Expect more details at IBM's investor day on February 4.\n\nFor the year ahead, IBM is estimating 5 percent revenue growth compared to 2024 and free cash flow of $13.5 billion. \u00ae",

Instead, IBM reported a $3.92 per share adjusted profit. Its sales were $17.56 billion.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings\n\nNot all of IBM's news was great. Sales for the quarter grew a bare 1%, and sales for the full fiscal year were up only 1.5%. Earnings for the quarter, while better than expected, still declined 13% year over year, as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), to just $3.09 per share. GAAP earnings for the year suffered worse, down 21% to $6.43 per share.\n\nNevertheless, IBM considers the quarter a success. CEO Arvind Krishna talked about double-digit revenue growth in software and highlighted the fact that \"our generative AI book of business now stands at more than $5 billion inception-to-date, up nearly $2 billion quarter over quarter.\"\n\nYou read that right. Despite all the worries about DeepSeek this week, IBM still wants investors to think of it as an artificial intelligence stock.\n\nIs IBM stock a buy?\n\nBut perhaps that's not a bad thing? After all, IBM says it generated $12.7 billion in positive free cash flow in 2024 -- twice its reported $6 billion in GAAP net income. And profit margins are ticking up as well. In the fourth quarter, the company grew its operating profit margin 50 basis points (by non-GAAP measurements), and non-GAAP margins were up 130 basis points for the full year.\n\nAnd turning to guidance, management says it's expecting to grow revenue at least 5% this year, and to grow free cash flow modestly, to $13.5 billion -- on a $239.5 billion market capitalization that values IBM at about 17.7 times this coming year's free cash flow.\n\nThat's cheaper than a lot of other tech stocks these days.

Additionally, while a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is not yet available, data may already be vulnerable to harvesting by cybercriminals for future decryption.\n\nIBM has developed quantum safe-focused enterprise software and research-driven assets for a holistic solution to anticipated quantum risks. IBM Guardium Quantum Safe, part of the broader IBM Guardium Data Security Center, helps organizations gain visibility and manage cryptography to address vulnerabilities, guide prioritization and remediation, and improve security posture. It also includes IBM Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager, which provides centralized, secured, and scalable encryption key management.\n\nComplementing these are IBM Quantum Safe Explorer and IBM Quantum Safe Remediator, technology assets for discovering cryptographic vulnerabilities in code, testing quantum safe algorithm performance, and establishing quantum safe proxies.\n\nPursuant to this agreement, the two companies will work together to combine IBM's quantum-safe technology with Telef\u00f3nica Tech's experience in providing managed and professional cybersecurity services with the aim to create solutions that provide security to companies and public administrations against the new and future security risks of a post-quantum world.\n\nThe solutions being discussed will be specifically designed to help protect organizations' critical data from the risk of being decrypted by quantum computers by implementing new quantum-safe cryptography standards defined by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). IBM has co-developed two of the three algorithms that have been published as post-quantum cryptography standards, contributing to data protection in the quantum era.\n\nRaquel Ruiz Lozano, Global Head of Strategic Partnerships for Telef\u00f3nica Tech, states: \"Quantum computing offers incredible opportunities, but it could also pose a significant challenge in terms of cybersecurity. This collaboration agreement with IBM allows us to continue to help address the potential risks of the post-quantum world, thanks to its IBM's quantum safe technology, and to offer our clients solutions to help protect their critical data and face this transformation with security and confidence.\"\n\nAdolfo Hern\u00e1ndez Pulido, Technology Managing Director for Telef\u00f3nica at IBM, highlights: \"It is critical for organizations to begin evaluating their cryptography and planning a transition to quantum-safe standards. At IBM, we are proud not only to have had a hand in the development of new post-quantum cryptography algorithms, but also to be leading the way with new quantum-safe technologies and services. We are thrilled to sign this collaboration agreement with Telef\u00f3nica Tech focused on quantum safe technology.\"\n\nThe prospective integration of IBM's quantum-safe technologies into Telef\u00f3nica Tech's portfolio of services is being engineered to enhance the proactive risk assessments capable of being carried out by Telef\u00f3nica Tech's operations professionals with the aim of helping organizations identify and address cryptography vulnerabilities in their infrastructures.\n\nConcordant with this agreement, Telef\u00f3nica Tech would also assist organizations in their transition to new cryptographic standards, protocols or algorithms to ensure resilience and agility against cybersecurity risks posed by quantum computing, and the transition to new quantum-safe encryption technologies.\n\nThe agreement also contemplates the creation of a joint use case office, focused on key areas such as communications encryption, adaptation to new secure algorithms, and the protection of critical environments.\n\nIn this context, IBM's infrastructure has already been deployed at Telef\u00f3nica's headquarters, located in Distrito Telef\u00f3nica (Madrid, Spain), to promote business development. This infrastructure is composed of elements specifically designed to promote a secure and resilient environment against the threats of the post-quantum world.\n\nThese include an IBM LinuxONE system, which is secured with end-to-end encryption including new quantum-safe cryptography; IBM Storage technology; and other advanced tools for protecting master and operational keys.\n\nAbout Telef\u00f3nica Tech\n\nTelef\u00f3nica Tech is the leading company in digital transformation.

Additionally, REL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) AI and OpenShift AI provide clients with a consistent and scalable AI foundation built on open source technology.\u201d\n\nEver since IBM laid out what Krishna called its midterm model in 2021, the company met or exceeded its target metrics for revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow growth.\n\n\u201cWe set out a plan for mid-single-digit growth, and we delivered on it, growing our revenue by a 6-percent CAGR (cumulative annual growth rate) over this period,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our segments delivered revenue growth in line with our model. Over the last three years, software grew ahead of our goal of mid-single digits, and this momentum continued with 9-percent growth in 2024. We committed to accelerate the growth of Red Hat, and we delivered double digits for the year. Infrastructure performed in line with our model, as we invested in innovation and transformed the business model. Consulting met the model for high-single-digit growth, although we acknowledge 2024 was below model. We are confident that our investment in partnerships and skills, as well as our early leadership in GenAI position us to accelerate consulting growth as we move forward.\u201d\n\nIBM is currently watching a number of macroeconomic factors that could impact the overall IT business going forward, but expects technology to help mitigate related issues, Krishna said.\n\n\u201c[These include] geopolitical tensions, interest rate volatility, supply chain vulnerabilities, demographic shifts, evolving cyber threats, are creating headwinds for businesses worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, technology is key to drive sustainable growth. IBM's combination of advanced technology and deep consulting expertise positions us to uniquely deliver end-to-end business transformations.\u201d\n\nIBM enters 2025 intent on enhancing its portfolio, Krishna said.\n\n\u201cOur early leadership in generative AI and the consulting advantage platform have positioned us well in today's evolving market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn infrastructure, the Z16 [mainframe family] is our most successful program in history, highlighting customer adoption and continued reliance on the mainframe. We see more opportunities ahead as our infrastructure solutions play a crucial role in helping clients bring AI workloads closer to the data, and we will launch Z17 in the middle of 2025.\u201d\n\nIBM in the fourth fiscal quarter saw strong traction in its Watsonx middleware solution and [Watsonx] AI Assistant, including Watsonx.governance, Watsonx.ai, Watsonx Code Assistant for Z, Watsonx Orchestrate, as well as products embedding AI such as IBM\u2019s Concert GenAI automation platform, Krishna said.\n\n\u201cConsulting remains key to designing and implementing AI use cases, driving Watsonx deployment,\u201d he said.\n\nIBM By The Numbers\n\nFor its fourth fiscal quarter 2024, which ended December 31, IBM reported total revenue of $17.55 billion, up slightly from the $17.38 billion the company reported for its fourth fiscal quarter 2023.\n\nOverall revenue includes:\n\nSoftware revenue of $7.92 billion, up from last year\u2019s $7.18 billion, which includes Red Hat revenue up 16 percent; automation revenue up 15 percent; data and AI revenue up 4 percent, security revenue up 5 per cent; and transaction processing revenue up 10 percent.\n\nConsulting revenue of $5.18 billion, down from last year\u2019s $5.28 billion, including business transformation revenue up 1 percent, technology consulting revenue down 7 percent, and application operations down 4 percent.\n\nInfrastructure revenue of $4.26 billion, down from $4.60 billion, including IBM Z mainframe revenue down 21 percent, distributed infrastructure flat, and infrastructure support down 2 percent.\n\nFinancing revenue of $170 million, down from $175 million.\n\nOther revenue of $29 million, down from $141 million.\n\nIBM also reported GAAP net income of $2.92 billion or $3.14 per share.\n\nFor all of fiscal 2024, IBM reported total revenue of $62.75 billion, up from the $61.86 billion the company reported for its fiscal 2023.\n\nIBM stock soared more than 8 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday to $248.55.",

            "content": "ARMONK, N.Y. and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- New global research from the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Institute for Business Value (IBV) and Palo Alto Networks\u00ae (NASDAQ: PANW), found that surveyed organizations are facing security complexity challenges as they juggle an average of 83 different security solutions from 29 vendors. It also shows 7 out of 10 surveyed companies with a high degree of security platformization report their cybersecurity investments have helped business outcomes such as operational efficiencies and revenue generation.\n\nIn the study, \"Capturing the cybersecurity dividend: How security platforms generate business value,\" more than half (52%) of surveyed executives note fragmentation of security solutions is limiting their ability to deal with cyber threats, but 75% of organizations that have embraced security platformization agree that better integration across security, hybrid cloud, AI, and other technology platforms is crucial. The analysis suggests the trend of adding more solutions to combat evolving security threats is contributing to inefficiency \u2013 impacting both performance and the bottom line \u2013 while moving to a platformized security approach can help businesses achieve reduced response times and costs without sacrificing security efficacy.\n\nCybersecurity Complexity is a Daunting Reality\n\nIncreased digital interconnectedness expands attack surfaces and can create new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and harder to defend against, while AI is being used by both defenders and attackers, creating a race in cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nIn an evolving threat landscape, surveyed executives estimate security fragmentation and complexity costs their organizations an average of 5% of their annual revenue. For a $20 billion annual revenue company, that's a $1 billion cost to the business in aggregate. Tally the costs of security incidents, lost productivity, failed digital transformations, stalled AI initiatives, loss of customer trust and reputational damage and the numbers add up.\n\n\"Organizations continue to be challenged with updating their security posture to address new threats, while simultaneously being pressed to reduce complexity and decrease spend,\" said Mark Hughes, Global Managing Partner for Cybersecurity Services, IBM. \"Security executives need to enable innovation, protect assets and derive value from their cybersecurity investments to help their organizations thrive and further their business goals.\"\n\n\"We have seen the positive impacts of adopting a platformized approach to security, and the benefits it delivers to organizations. In today's AI-fueled world, strong partnerships are more essential than ever,\" said Karim Temsamani, President, Next Generation Security, Palo Alto Networks. \"IBM and Palo Alto Networks are aligned on a common vision of creating better outcomes for our customers - whether in value, operational, or security\u2026and platformization accomplishes all of them. This isn't just about improving fragmentation today, it's about enabling better outcomes for the future.\"\n\nKey insights from surveyed business leaders:\n\n52% of executives say complexity is the biggest impediment to their cybersecurity operations;\n\n80% agree they face pressure to reduce the cost of security, and 41% say security fragmentation has driven up procurement costs;\n\n4 out of 5 non-platform organizations say their security operations cannot effectively deal with the sheer quantity of threats and attacks;\n\n80% of platformization adopters say they have full visibility into potential vulnerabilities and threats; and,\n\nFor platformized organizations, mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC) security incidents are shorter by an average of 72 and 84 days, respectively.\n\nEnhancing Businesses with Platformization: Unleashing the Power of Digital Transformation\n\nIn today's world, the research finds effective security requires platformization. Consolidating multiple tools into a unified platform not only bolsters security posture but enables organizations to experience nearly 4 times better return on investment (ROI) from their cybersecurity investments, leading to revenue generation and increased operational efficiencies.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, a platform approach can also enable an organization to better ingest and analyze data to deliver actionable insights. With 90% of surveyed executives expecting to scale, optimize, or innovate with AI within the next two years, integrating AI into their platforms can play a critical role in advancing their security preparedness. For example, accelerating adoption of agentic AI for security and tapping platformization for fewer investment cycles; or, using platformization to create the common governance needed to deliver the AI capabilities shaping the future.\n\nBy adopting a platformization approach, businesses can align technologies, drive innovation, and prioritize security as a core business requirement. Through IBM and Palo Alto Networks' strategic partnership, the companies are bringing together leading security platforms, AI, and transformation capabilities to help organizations confidently navigate their digital transformation journey, achieve their desired outcomes and drive substantial business value.\n\nTips for Platformization Success\n\nChoose partners that streamline your security mission and trim those that don't .

            "content": "International Business Machines (IBM 0.17%) is set to report its fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, Jan. 29. IBM stock has surged 65% over the past three years as the company spun off a big low-growth business and settled into a strategy focused on hybrid-cloud and AI platforms.\n\nWith IBM trading near its all-time high, is it smart to buy the stock now or wait until the earnings dust has settled?\n\nFor long-term investors, timing doesn't really matter\n\nShares of IBM could do just about anything in response to Wednesday's report. If the company comes up short of expectations, provides lackluster guidance, or discloses a slowdown in AI-related bookings, the stock could drop. If instead the tone is more optimistic, the stock could rally.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, trying to time the market is mostly a waste of time. If you buy and hold IBM stock for years, short-term fluctuations driven by quarterly earnings just aren't going to matter.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to buy IBM stock, either now or after the Q4 report. The company has finally found its groove after a decade-long transformation effort, and the next ten years look a lot more promising than the last ten years. IBM's unique combination of software platforms and consulting services has set it up for steady growth in the years ahead.\n\nIBM's Q3 results were mixed relative to expectations, but the numbers largely looked good. Software revenue soared 10% year over year, with a solid 9% transaction processing growth coupled with 14% growth in the Red Hat portfolio. The consulting segment was flat, although challenges weren't a surprise. There's plenty of demand for digital transformation projects, but in other areas, clients have been stingier with their spending.\n\nThe consulting business is a critical component of IBM's growth strategy, and that's nowhere more apparent than in AI. As of the end of Q3, IBM has booked more than $3 billion worth of generative AI-related business. The company's watsonx.ai platform is the centerpiece of the company's generative AI efforts, but roughly 80% of those bookings were consulting signings. With its consulting arm, IBM can tap into demand for AI implementation and other related services while also pitching its own AI software products.\n\nA reasonably priced stock\n\nIBM expects to generate more than $12 billion in free cash flow for 2024, and investors will know on Wednesday whether the company hit that target. Based on the current market capitalization, IBM stock trades for 17 times that free-cash-flow outlook.\n\nThat's not an unreasonable price to pay. IBM isn't the fastest growing company, but it does have a vast enterprise customer base with relationships that sometimes go back decades. As those clients look to modernize applications and deploy generative AI, IBM is positioning itself as the obvious choice for a partner.\n\nIBM's free-cash-flow guidance for 2025 will likely play a big role in how the stock behaves following the Q4 report. IBM should be able to grow its free cash flow this year, although there are a lot of moving parts that could impact the company's results. Regardless of how IBM's results and guidance are perceived by the market, the stock is a buy for long-term investors.",

These two limits are of special interest because \\(\\omega _{out}\\), the frequency of the free field after the expansion, is the frequency that will appear in the Hamiltonian governing the time evolution of the field after the universe expands. Additionally, together with \\(\\omega _{in}\\), these are the frequencies that are needed to relate the vibrational modes of the field before and after the expansion, which is crucial for computing the number of particles created by the expansion of the universe.\n\nClearly, the vibration modes of the field are not the same before and after a short period of inflation. Initially, the field is stationary in the vacuum state \\({|{0, in}\\rangle }\\). After the inflationary evolution, however, this state is not going to be an eigenstate of the time evolution anymore, so we could detect a number of particles different from zero and study their evolution over time.\n\nWe have chosen this model because the vibration modes of the field before inflation can be easily related to those after inflation, in the sense that the vibrations with momentum k mix only with their opposite \\(-k\\), but not with other configurations with different |k|. The Bogoliubov transformations that relate the vibration modes \\(\\phi ^{in}\\) and \\(\\phi ^{out}\\) are given by:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\phi _k^{in} = \\alpha _k \\phi _k^{out} + \\beta _k \\phi _{-k}^{out*}, \\end{aligned}$$ (9)\n\nwhere the coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are complex functions of \\(\\omega _{in}\\), \\(\\omega _{out}\\) and \\(\\rho\\)22:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\alpha _k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega _{out}}{\\omega _{in}}} \\frac{\\Gamma \\left( 1-i\\frac{\\omega _{in}}{\\rho }\\right) \\Gamma \\left( -i\\frac{\\omega _{out}}{\\rho }\\right) }{\\Gamma \\left( -i\\frac{\\omega _+}{\\rho }\\right) \\Gamma \\left( 1-i\\frac{\\omega _+}{\\rho }\\right) }, \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\beta _k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega _{out}}{\\omega _{in}}} \\frac{\\Gamma \\left( 1-i\\frac{\\omega _{in}}{\\rho }\\right) \\Gamma \\left( i\\frac{\\omega _{out}}{\\rho }\\right) }{\\Gamma \\left( i\\frac{\\omega _-}{\\rho }\\right) \\Gamma \\left( 1+i\\frac{\\omega _-}{\\rho }\\right) }, \\end{aligned}$$ (10)\n\nwith \\(\\omega _\\pm =\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\omega _{out}\\pm \\omega _{in}\\right)\\).\n\nThe reason why we are using this toy model to simulate the cosmological particle production is because its simplicity allows us to write an analytical expression for the Bogoliubov coefficients, which relate the vibrational modes of the field, and its respective quantized observables, before and after the expansion. For other models whose relationship between modes is not known, it is not possible to perform such simulations. Furthermore, in more general models of QFTCS, the number of particles is not well-defined, depending on the observer measuring it. A classical example of this is black hole thermal radiation, which is zero for a near-horizon freely falling observer, but non-zero for a stationary one. In contrast, our model allows us choose an observer who initially detects the vacuum and study the particle creation from its perspective.\n\nWhen quantizing the field, we use the annihilation and creation operators \\(a_+\\) and \\(a_+^\\dagger\\) for the in modes of positive k, and \\(a_-\\) and \\(a_-^\\dagger\\) for the in modes of negative k. These creation and annihilation operators are related to the annihilation and creation operators of the out modes, which we call \\(b_+\\), \\(b_+^\\dagger\\), \\(b_-\\) and \\(b_-^\\dagger\\), using the same Bogoliubov coefficients32,33:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} & b_+ = \\alpha a_+ + \\beta ^* a_-^\\dagger \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad b_+^\\dagger = \\alpha ^* a_+^\\dagger + \\beta a_-, \\end{aligned}$$ (11)\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} & b_- = \\alpha a_- + \\beta ^* a_+^\\dagger \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad b_-^\\dagger = \\alpha ^* a_-^\\dagger + \\beta a_+. \\end{aligned}$$ (12)\n\nNow, the generator of the time evolution of these two positive and negative modes is the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\mathcal {H}}&= \\hbar \\omega _{out} \\left( b_+^\\dagger b_+ + b_-^\\dagger b_- \\right) \\\\&= \\hbar \\omega _{out} \\left( \\alpha \\alpha ^* \\left( a_+^\\dagger a_+ + a_-^\\dagger a_- \\right) + \\beta \\beta ^* \\left( a_+ a_+^\\dagger + a_- a_-^\\dagger \\right) + 2 \\alpha ^* \\beta a_+^\\dagger a_-^\\dagger + 2 \\alpha \\beta ^* a_+ a_- \\right) . \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (13)\n\nIn the interaction picture, an initial vacuum state will evolve under the interaction hamiltonian:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\mathcal {H}_{int} = 2 \\hbar \\omega _{out} \\alpha \\beta ^* a_+ a_- + h.c. \\end{aligned}$$ (14)\n\nThus the time evolution operator in this picture is:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} U = e^{i \\omega _{out} t \\left( 2 \\alpha \\beta ^* a_+ a_- + h.c. \\right) }. \\end{aligned}$$ (15)\n\nWe are interested in the number of particles\u2014as defined before the expansion by the in operators- created after the expansion as a function of the expansion rate \\(\\rho\\).\n\nThis type of particle creation process due to a non-flat metric can be interpreted as if the field were in thermodynamic equilibrium with a thermal source34,35. Therefore, the state predicted by quantum field theory for the time evolution operator 15 applied to an initial vacuum is a state well-known in quantum optics\u2014two-mode squeezed state36 where \\(2 \\alpha \\beta ^* \\omega _{out} t\\) is the squeezing parameter. When the trace over one mode is taken over a two-mode squeezed state, a single-mode thermal state with squeezing-dependent temperature is obtained37, giving rise to:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\rho = \\frac{1}{\\cosh ^2 \\left( 2 \\left| \\alpha \\right| \\left| \\beta \\right| \\omega _{out} t \\right) } \\sum _{n=0}^\\infty \\tanh ^{2n} \\left( 2 \\left| \\alpha \\right| \\left| \\beta \\right| \\omega _{out} t \\right) {|{n}\\rangle } {\\langle {n}|}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16)\n\nTherefore, the expected number of particles created can be calculated as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\left\\langle {n}\\right\\rangle = \\sinh ^2\\left( 2\\left| \\alpha \\right| \\left| \\beta \\right| \\omega _{out}t\\right) . \\end{aligned}$$ (17)\n\nAs we will see below, we will restrict ourselves to only one created particle per mode. The state restricted to one excitation can be obtained by taking the first two terms of the sum in (16) and renormalizing, giving rise to:",

It also sent shockwaves through the financial markets as it prompted investors to reconsider the valuations of chipmakers like NVIDIA and the colossal investments that American AI giants are making to scale their AI businesses.\n\nWhy all the buzz? A so-called \"reasoning model,\" DeepSeek-R1 is a digital assistant that performs as well as OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain AI benchmarks for math and coding tasks, was trained with far fewer chips and is approximately 96% cheaper to use, according to the company.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is definitely reshaping the AI landscape, challenging giants with open-source ambition and state-of-the-art innovations,\u201d says Kaoutar El Maghraoui, a Principal Research Scientist and Manager at IBM AI Hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant that owns TikTok, recently announced its own reasoning agent, UI-TARS, which it claims outperforms OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini on certain benchmarks. ByteDance\u2019s agent can read graphical interfaces, reason and take autonomous, step-by-step action.\n\nFrom startups to established giants, Chinese AI companies appear to be closing the gap with their American rivals, in large part thanks to their willingness to open source or share the underlying software code with other businesses and software developers. \u201cDeepSeek has been able to proliferate some pretty powerful models across the community,\u201d says Abraham Daniels, a Senior Technical Product Manager for IBM\u2019s Granite model. DeepSeek-R1 is offered on Hugging Face under an MIT license that permits unrestricted commercial use. \u201cDeepSeek could really accelerate AI democratization,\u201d he says.\n\nLast summer, Chinese company Kuaishou unveiled a video-generating tool that was like OpenAI\u2019s Sora but available to the public out of the gates. Sora was unveiled last February but was only fully released in December and even then only those with a ChatGPT Pro subscription could access all of its features. Developers on Hugging Face have also snapped up new open-source models from the Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba. While Meta has open-sourced its Llama models, both OpenAI and Google have pursued a predominantly closed-source approach to their model development.\n\nBesides the boon of open source, DeepSeek engineers also used only a fraction of the highly specialized NVIDIA chips used by that of their American competitors to train their systems. DeepSeek engineers, for example, said they needed only 2,000 GPUs (graphic processing units), or chips, to train their DeepSeek-V3 model, according to a research paper they published with the model\u2019s release.",

Acceleration in the Red Hat business. And updates to closing the $7 billion acquisition of HashiCorp. These are some of the most likely subjects to come up Wednesday when IBM\u2019s leadership reports earnings for the Armonk, N.Y.-based vendor\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter earnings, covering the quarter ended Dec. 31. IBM could be looking at fourth fiscal quarter revenue of $17.5 billion, coming just under Wall Street\u2019s expected $17.6 billion, mostly due to foreign exchange rates, Bank of America said in a report this month. [RELATED: IBM Looks To Purchase Oracle Consultancy Amid HashiCorp Scrutiny] IBM Q2 Earnings IBM CEO Arvind Krishna and his leadership team could forecast $14.6 billion in revenue for the next reported quarter, according to Bank of America. For 2025, however, IBM could be looking at 7 percent year over year growth in 2025 ignoring foreign exchange, ahead of Wall Street expectations, with free cash flow of $12.6 billion, according to Bank of America. Here\u2019s more of what partners can expect during IBM\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report this week.\n\nAI Momentum On Wednesday\u2019s call, IBM executives will likely have updates for analysts around the vendor\u2019s momentum in the artificial intelligence space, a field IBM solution providers have played a key role in. The vendor\u2019s enterprise AI business $1 billion quarter to quarter in October, with a book of business related to generative AI exceeding $3 billion inception to date. Analysts will await more news of growing IBM AI excitement from customers. Recent AI news from IBM includes the upcoming release of Rise with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server, which aims to support AI-powered business processes and working with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to train the next generations of IBM\u2019s Granite AI models, according to IBM.\n\n2025 Product Cycles While PC sellers have their attention on a potential mass device refresh with AI-powered devices on the market and Windows 10 end of support coming, IBM partners have a series of major releases expected this year. One of the most notable releases will be z17, prompting a mainframe refresh cycle\u2013although at least one analyst firm foresees short-term pain for z16 partners. Fourth fiscal quarter IBM infrastructure revenue may have fallen 9 percent year over year due to IBM\u2019s waning z16 mainframe cycle, with z17\u2019s expected release in mid-2025, according to Bank of America. The firm predicts IBM infrastructure revenue falling 5 percent year over year in the first fiscal quarter. The segment should look better the rest of 2025, with the firm modeling 6 percent growth year over year for IBM infrastructure for all of fiscal year 2025. The refresh cycle could fuel 5 percent growth year over year in IBM\u2019s infrastructure business for the 2025 calendar year, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s report this month. IBM enterprise license agreement (ELA) activity in the second half of 2025 could fuel 8 percent year over year growth in IBM\u2019s software business. VARs ranked IBM among the best performing hardware vendors for expected 2025 growth year over year with 2.6 percent expected growth, with the mainframe refresh and ELA cycle contributing factors, according to the Morgan Stanley report. For comparison, Dell VARs expect 3.1 percent growth year over year, Logitech VARs expect 2.8 percent and HP VARs expect 1.4 percent growth year over year, according to the report.\n\nAnalysts will likely seek updates from IBM leadership on closing the vendor\u2019s nearly $7 billion acquisition of Terraform creator and cloud provider HashiCorp, announced back in April. IBM had plans to close the deal last year. But the deal received scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority at the start of 2025. On Jan. 21, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) published a letter seeking information from the public about the acquisition, with a Feb. 4 closing date for submissions and ACCC results provisionally set for March. Bank of America appeared optimistic in IBM closing the HashiCorp deal soon, even factoring HashiCorp \u2013plus strength in Red Hat and the transaction processing business\u2013as part of the firm\u2019s expected 7 percent revenue growth year over year in IBM software in 2025. In December, HashiCorp reported its third fiscal quarter results, revealing $173.4 million in revenue during the quarter, an increase of 19 percent year over year. HashiCorp saw gross profit using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $143.6 million in the quarter and an operating loss of $29.9 million\u2013a 46 percent improvement over the $55.6 million operating loss experienced in the same period the year prior. The vendor\u2019s GAAP net loss was $13 million in the third quarter, a 67 percent improvement over the $39.5 million net loss experienced in the same period a year prior. Third fiscal quarter remaining performance obligation (RPO) using GAAP was $775.4 million, up 14 percent year over year, according to HashiCorp.\n\nRed Hat Acceleration Speaking of Red Hat, eyes will be on whether this IBM subsidiary continues to ride a wave of momentum from AI and from VMware customers looking for a different vendor. On Monday, Red Hat announced updates to its partner program\u2013still separate from IBM\u2019s\u2013including an upcoming \u201cbuild\u201d module for Red Hat system integrator and technology partners and integrated go-to-market (GTM) activities within partner program modules. Red Hat also closed this month on its acquisition of GenAI inference workloads accelerator Neural Magic and made improvements to its product portfolio including the introduction of Red Hat OpenShift confidential containers on bare metal and the Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine for virtualization workloads. VARs expect Red Hat to see 3.3 percent growth year over year in 2025, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s January report. That expectation represents accelerating growth from 2024. Based on expected strong bookings, AI industry trends and Red Hat potentially taking market share from VMware, Bank of America expects mid-teens revenue growth for the IBM subsidiary in the fiscal year, according to a report this month.",

As a result, many are considering modernization to reduce their reliance on these technologies.\n\nThese same businesses are looking to enable agile evolution of the customer experience through digital transformation. This effort requires a scalable, low-cost environment that integrates with modern cloud-based technologies and development practices.\n\nIn addition, customers are looking to improve time-to-market with agile development while adopting cloud capabilities, better reporting, and easier integration with mobile, social, and analytics applications.\n\nThis combination of factors often drives Natural and Adabas modernization to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This post highlights the modernization paths available for Natural and Adabas with IBM ModernSystems and AWS. The division offers refactor and replatform functionality, as well as self-service migration options.\n\nIBM Consulting is an AWS Premier Tier Services Partner and Managed Service Provider (MSP) that offers comprehensive service capabilities addressing both business and technology challenges that clients face today.\n\nSolution Overview\n\nKey to minimizing risk while modernizing Natural and Adabas is the maturity of the options offered by IBM ModernSystems unique software and services.\n\nThe IBM ModernSystems accelerator acts as the cornerstone of these solutions. Each provides an end-to-end strategic pathway to lower costs by eliminating the supplier license costs for Natural and Adabas, while preserving legacy assets and business rules.\n\nThe illustration below depicts the source to target mapping with IBM ModernSystems accelerator.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Natural Adabas modernization overview.\n\nAutomated Refactoring of Natural to Java or C#\n\nThe IBM ModernSystems accelerator solution can refactor Natural source code into a functionally equivalent modern application either in Java or C#. Refactored code can be maintained or extended with any modern integrated development environment (IDE). IBM ModernSystems accelerator also provides options for embedding the Natural language in the comments to help former Natural developers find business logic within the structure of the new application.\n\nTechnical capabilities of Natural/Adabas refactoring are:\n\nAutomatically refactor all Natural objects including programs, subprograms, data definition modules (DDMs), maps, and data area types.\n\nMaintain and execute refactored code as native Java or C# .NET on AWS.\n\nAuto-refactor Natural Report Mode code to Structure Mode.\n\nJCL conversion to PowerShell or Spring Batch XML (Java JSR352 standard).\n\nSupport customers who opt to retain their JCL and PROCS as-is in the target environment and execute them using IBM ModernSystems eavJES solution.\n\nAssure the refactored code meets the quality standards set by SonarQube.\n\nMaintain and enhance the refactored applications as web applications (Angular for user interfaces).\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Natural Adabas workload modernization \u2013 Refactor landing zone on AWS\n\nOnce the legacy applications and databases are refactored and deployed into AWS, developers can extend the application functionality using standard DevOps tools and CI/CD using services like AWS Code Pipeline and AWS Code Build. Business logic from the legacy Natural code is preserved as-is.\n\nAn additional level of optimization can be applied in IBM ModernSystems accelerator for efficient delivery and to take advantage of AWS services.\n\nReplatforming Natural\n\nEnterprises that wish to retain their legacy codebase can execute Natural syntax on Windows using IBM ModernSystems accelerator. The resulting applications are identical to those on the mainframe, minimizing the amount of change that occurs when migrating from the mainframe to AWS.\n\nReplatforming provides a relatively low-cost and low-risk way to reduce mainframe operating expenses and maintain the business value that the original applications provide.\n\nSince the Natural syntax remains as-is, organizations can continue to leverage their existing Natural development talent while providing them with new features within IBM ModernSystems accelerator.\n\nIBM ModernSystems accelerator includes a fully-featured UX development workbench for Natural developers, which includes Natural code analysis, flow diagramming, impact analysis, pattern matching, version comparison, and interactive debugging capabilities. In other words, Natural development teams can continue to develop and maintain applications with the support of modern, efficient development tools.\n\nFor the execution of the Natural Online programs, IBM ModernSystems accelerator interprets and executes each Natural command at a byte level, allowing existing Natural applications to execute as-is against the new relational database without any changes to the original code.\n\nIBM ModernSystems accelerator processing engine interprets the Natural READ, WRITE, and other I/O commands. This creates equivalent SQL syntax to perform the data access/updates against the new database.\n\nIBM ModernSystems accelerator enables modern business intelligence (BI) tools to integrate with the relational database in ways the legacy system would never have allowed.\n\nIn the re-platformed environment in AWS, JCL runs in IBM ModernSystems eavJES batch execution environment, an add-on to the IBM ModernSystems accelerator suite with a fully featured set of tools. Developers can maintain the JCL and PROCS, resulting in flawless execution with very little change.\n\nExecution results in the same actions, cataloguing, restart, and recovery as in the mainframe environment. The catalog is constantly monitored and maintained during job execution and can even allow command line manipulation of datasets.\n\nPath to Extended Modernization After Replatforming\n\nThe Replatforming Natural path aids customers who choose to undertake a phased approach for moving into a modern language. IBM ModernSystems accelerator provides the ability to automatically refactor the codebase to Java or C# through a simple transformation using the \u201cSave As\u201d function.\n\nThe newly-refactored Java/C# code is functionally equivalent to the legacy Natural application. The new code operates using a web UI and Angular. This feature enables extended modernization to support the re-use of developers\u2019 existing skillsets in Natural and their extensive knowledge of the applications, while deploying as Java or C#.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Natural Adabas workload modernization \u2013 Replatform landing zone on AWS.\n\nAutomated Adabas Migration\n\nIn conjunction with either Automated Refactoring or Replatforming Natural, all Adabas databases will be migrated to relational equivalents (Amazon RDS for SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, Amazon Aurora).\n\nEach resulting relational database will have the same functionality and traversal capabilities as the original Adabas. Natural unload programs are auto-generated to allow the client to extract the data from Adabas into a format that is ready-to-load to the new relational database.\n\nThe new relational database is generated with base tables, child tables, and grandchild tables as needed to replace the Adabas Multiple Occurring Field (MU) and Periodic Group (PE) instances. This allows the new databases to include table-to-table relationships expected in a relational data model.\n\nAccess to the MU and PE data is handled by the IBM ModernSystems accelerator engine when running with the IBM ModernSystems accelerator. The Natural program code receives the data in the expected view format.\n\nNew relational database includes the field types that are definable in the new database (small integer, integer, decimal, binary).\n\nAll packed and zoned decimal data is transitioned to the relational data type when it\u2019s extracted from Adabas.\n\nBinary data is preserved during the file transfer protocol (FTP) from the mainframe using scripts, which prevent the conversion of the selected fields.\n\nAll existing mainframe Adabas data is transitioned to a valid data type in the target database.\n\nEach data field is written to the extract file in a display format, so that even packed fields are written as display fields.\n\nThe EBCDIC extracted data files are converted to ASCII as the data is transmitted from the mainframe to AWS. As a result of the transition from EBCDIC to ASCII, there may be differences in some sort sequences when numeric and alphanumeric data is represented in the same data field.\n\nInternal sequence numbers (ISN) are preserved during the extract process. New row occurrences will receive the next available ISN number using the optimum mechanism provided by the new relational database management system.\n\nIncludes the generation of Natural programs and related JCL to migrate the Adabas data to sequential files for loading to the new relational database.\n\nBe aware that Adabas replacement often requires materialized views to replace super-descriptor and sub-descriptor functionality, and that stored procedures ensure accuracy and high performance in the new solutions. The target database should support the features needed to replace this functionality.\n\nBenefits of Natural Modernization with IBM ModernSystems accelerator\n\n\n\nWith IBM ModernSystems accelerator, modernizing your Natural and Adabas environment to AWS will provide the following benefits:\n\nOptions for both replatforming and refactoring, along with automated Adabas migration.\n\nCost reduction by eliminating mainframe MIPS (millions of instructions per processor second) and Natural Adabas license costs.\n\nModern relational database unleashes the data for distributed applications on AWS.\n\nReport generation capability improvements.\n\nBetter developer experience with a modern IDE, IBM ModernSystems environment, and DevOps enablement.\n\nEase of user community adoption through identical functional experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the IBM ModernSystems accelerator, customers can migrate from procedural Natural code and pre-relational Adabas databases into AWS either by refactoring or replatforming.\n\nThis is designed to support customers regardless of where they are in their modernization journey.

There are no current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies and many unanswered questions regarding disease pathogenesis, course, and outcomes. We leveraged big data resources to conduct a retrospective analysis of IBM patient mortality among United States veterans.\n\nData were extracted from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) (federal register: 79 FR 4377). Adults over age 18 with an outpatient International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9 or 10 visit code or problem list entry for IBM between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2021, with a minimum of 2 visits with Neurology or Rheumatology a minimum of 30 d apart were included. Patients with other inflammatory myopathies or autoimmune diseases were excluded. Date of first ICD code or problem list entry was inferred to be date of IBM diagnosis. Diagnoses of smoking and diabetes mellitus or cancer were similarly identified. Patients were matched to controls using the \u201cccoptimalmatch\u201d R package based on age, sex, race, ethnicity with a zero difference for age and follow-up period enforced [3]. Current Procedural Terminology codes identified patient computerized tomography (CT) imaging studies of the chest/thorax, which were tokenized using \u201ctidytext\u201d and \u201ctokenizers\u201d R packages. Lung involvement was denoted as follows: interstitial lung disease (ILD)\u2014mention of \u201cinterstitial lung disease\u201d or ground glass opacities; bronchiectasis\u2014mention of \u201cbronchiectasis\u201d and/or mucus plugging; fibrosis\u2014mention of \u201cfibrosis\u201d, including \u201choneycombing\u201d or \u201cscarring\u201d changes. We excluded manifestations due to infection, malignancy, or other processes as interpreted by the reading radiologist as well as atelectasis changes and minor lung nodules. The primary outcome was mortality from any cause with a censor date of December 10, 2023. This study was granted informed consent exemption status by the Pittsburgh VA Institutional Review Board Committee based on Revised Common Rule/2018 (Project #1707389\u20131).\n\nA total of 732 IBM patients and 1215 matched patient controls met study criteria (Additional file 1: Table S1). The follow-up period was (5.6 \u00b1 3.4) years, and 60.9% (446/732) of patients were managed by Neurology, 16.0% (117/732) were treated by Rheumatology, and 23.1% (169/732) were co-managed. Veteran service periods ranged from World War II to the Persian Gulf War with the majority\u201467.9% (497)\u2014serving during the Vietnam-Era. There was no difference in service periods between IBM and patient controls. IBM veterans were predominantly male (96.7%), White (70.2%), and of non-Hispanic or -Latino ethnicity (89.2%). The mean age of patients was (54.4 \u00b1 8.5) years and mean age at IBM diagnosis was (48.4 \u00b1 8.7) years. Black patients made up 22.1% of IBM veterans and 7.7% identified as Other or did not provide race. Compared with an unpublished analysis performed by our group of 6,789,284 active individuals in the CDW, our cohort contained fewer women (3.3% vs. 9.4%, P < 0.0001) and more Black patients (22.1% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.0006). The mean maximum creatine phosphokinase level of IBM patients was (925.0 \u00b1 1892.1) U/L. The 5 most common diagnoses among control patients\u2014in order of frequency\u2014were tobacco use (12.2%, 148/1215), primary hypertension (6.1%, 74/1215), gastroesophageal reflux (3.0%, 36/1215), hyperlipidemia (2.0%, 24/1215), and contact or exposure to other hazardous substance (2.0%, 24/1215). IBM patients were more likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (49.5% vs. 6.6%, P < 0.001) and cancer (38.4% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001), and be current or prior smokers (23.2% vs. 15.8%, P < 0.001). The most common malignancies seen in IBM patients were prostate, skin, renal, bladder, and colon cancers, and lymphoma. There were no cases of T cell leukemia as previously reported [4].\n\nTesting for autoantibodies against U1 ribonucleoprotein (U1RNP), the 52 kD isoform of Sjogren Syndrome antigen A (SSA/Ro), and cytosolic 5\u2019-nucleotidase (NT5c1A) in IBM was insufficient for analysis. There were no group differences in exposures to Agent Orange, ionizing radiation, Southwest Asia conditions, military sexual trauma, combat, shipboard hazard defense, and history of head and neck cancer. 134 IBM patients (18.3%) had CT studies in our database compared with 273 (22.5%) of matched controls. Both exhibited similar prevalence of lung scarring/fibrosis (11.9% vs. 16.5%, P = 0.290) while IBM patients were more likely to display bronchiectasis (57.5% vs. 15.4%, P < 0.001) and ILD (61.9% vs. 48.4%, P < 0.001). This difference could not be explained solely by smoking status (23.2% vs. 15.8%, P < 0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S1).\n\nKaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis comparing mortality from any cause between IBM patients and matched controls revealed strikingly worse mean survival among the former [mean 10% mortality for IBM 2.2 years (95%CI 1.8 \u20132.6) vs. 15.0 years (95%CI 14.0\u201316.0) for matched controls, P < 0.001; Fig. 1]. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions showed that a diagnosis of IBM had the highest hazard ratio (HR) (HR = 22.64, 95%CI 17.56\u201329.20, P < 0.001 and HR = 18.07, 95% CI 8.54\u201338.22, P < 0.001 for univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively). Age, sex, race, ethnicity, presence of diabetes mellitus, cancer, and imaging evidence of ILD or bronchiectasis were significant in univariate regressions (Additional file 1: Table S2). Fig. 1 Kaplan\u2013Meier survival plot for inclusion body myositis (IBM) as compared with matched control patients Full size image\n\nThis is the study of IBM in a veteran population and one of the most racially diverse IBM cohorts examined. Black patients with IBM were overrepresented and all IBM patients exhibited drastically decreased survival (mean 8.5 years) compared with controls. As there are no current treatments for IBM, we do not suspect that potential delays in diagnosis would have influenced our analysis, especially given its age-matched design. Two prior civilian cohorts reported a similar observation: a Dutch analysis reported 15 of 64 (24%) patients alive after 12 years [5], whereas a study from the Mayo clinic found a 10-year survival rate of 36% [4].

Its role in fostering a hybrid cloud and its watsonx AI have again made it a company to watch in the technology space.\n\nA part of IBM that may have received less coverage is its role in quantum computing. In many respects, IBM leads the way in that industry, and many investors may wonder whether that cutting-edge technology makes IBM stock a buy.\n\nIBM stock and quantum computing\n\nQuantum computing is a potentially promising but uncertain technology for IBM. Traditional computing bits are made up of either 0s or 1s, which limit computing speeds. In contrast, qubits, or quantum bits, can hold any value between 0 and 1, which can increase computing speeds exponentially.\n\nIt is in this environment that IBM has built its quantum computing fleet. Its quantum computing stack includes services and tools provided by IBM and its third-party partners. IBM Quantum serves its customers through Qiskit, a suite of software tools and services providing customers with a holistic quantum experience. This includes managed services, a tool kit, and a serverless interface where customers can run workloads through both quantum and traditional resources.\n\nStill, advancements in processing power have exposed a key challenge. The more qubits a chip can process, the more error-prone it becomes, which could negate any benefit that quantum computing offers.\n\nHowever, error mitigation has become a priority in IBM's advancements. Its newly released Heron chip addresses the potential for errors while running twice as many gates, a basic quantum circuit, as it could two years ago. More importantly, it represents the continuation of IBM's quantum development roadmap, which promises an advanced, error-corrected system by 2029.\n\nTechnical challenges\n\nAll in all, IBM's quantum computing shows potential for leadership in this industry. However, when looking outside of science and research, quantum computing is, in many respects, a solution without a problem. While exponentially faster computing could provide tremendous benefits, the industry must outline how the technology can solve problems in the commercial realm.\n\nMoreover, the quantum computing industry has become tremendously competitive. Google parent Alphabet has just developed its Willow chip, which promises to reduce error rates as it adds qubits. Also, start-up quantum computing companies like IonQ could disrupt larger companies if it develops competitive advantages. While its quantum ecosystem could help IBM stand out, the company may struggle to distinguish itself as the competition intensifies.\n\nIBM's financials\n\nAdditionally, IBM's financials may offer a mixed bag to investors. Even with its successes with the cloud and AI, IBM's revenue of $45 billion in the first three quarters of 2024 rose by less than 2% yearly. Its most successful segment, software, grew revenue by only 8% during this time.\n\nDespite slow revenue growth, free cash flow in the first nine months of the year was $6.6 billion, up from $5.2 billion in the same year-ago period. That allowed the company to fund the $4.6 billion needed to maintain its dividend during that time.\n\nThe payout, which has risen for 29 straight years, is now $6.68 per share annually. With a 3% dividend yield -- far above the 1.2% S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.94%) average -- IBM is arguably the dividend stock of the cloud and AI. That source of cash could pay investors to wait for quantum computing to hopefully live up to its potential.\n\nFurthermore, in order to benefit from this opportunity, investors will have to contend with the stock's P/E ratio of 33. That is higher than Alphabet, which currently sells at 26 times earnings despite double-digit revenue growth. Indeed, some investors will find IBM's dividend attractive, but for most investors, the company's higher valuation could make it a less appealing value proposition in the quantum computing space.\n\nShould you invest in IBM?\n\nConsidering the state of the quantum computing industry and the stock's valuation, investors should probably stay on the sidelines, unless buying for the dividend income.\n\nAdmittedly, IBM's moves in the cloud and AI spaces have made it a serious competitor in the cloud and AI spaces. If the company can commercially apply its quantum computing capabilities, it could become a top tech stock again. Its growing dividend with a high yield should also make it appealing to dividend investors.\n\nUnfortunately, the company's revenue growth lags that of peers like Alphabet. As long as investors can buy the Google parent more cheaply, IBM is probably not the quantum computing stock of choice for non-income investors.",

            "content": "Quantum computing is hot right now. Shares of pure play quantum computing stocks have been soaring, and the hype train has clearly left the station. Investors should know, however, that quantum computers have never been used to solve a real-world problem faster than a traditional computer and that useful quantum computers could very well be decades away. While quantum computing is exciting and potentially a big deal, it's nowhere close to being a commercially viable reality.\n\nBecause quantum computing is likely at least many years away from being useful for real-world computations, the smart play is to bet on International Business Machines (IBM 0.24%) and Alphabet (GOOG 0.27%) (GOOGL 0.23%). If you've got $1000 to invest and want low-risk exposure to quantum computing, these two tech giants are no-brainers.\n\nA quantum pioneer\n\nThe very first computer that took advantage of the complex and bizarre principles of quantum mechanics was built by researchers at IBM and a few major universities way back in 1998. Nearly three decades ago, those researchers successfully sorted an unordered list of items using a computer that used quantum bits, or qubits, fashioned from hydrogen and chlorine atoms.\n\nIBM has been working on quantum computing technology since then, contributing to major advancements in the field. The company made a quantum computer accessible via the cloud in 2016, and it's built more powerful models in the ensuing years. IBM researchers used a 127-qubit quantum computer in 2023 to accurately solve a certain type of problem, albeit one without any real-world applications, faster than a traditional computer.\n\nIBM's quantum roadmap calls for a quantum-centric supercomputer in 2025, a 200-qubit system in 2029, and quantum-centric supercomputers with thousands of qubits that may be capable of solving security, chemistry, machine learning, and optimization problems sometime after 2033. We're likely still many years away from useful quantum computing systems, but IBM is pushing hard toward that goal.\n\nThe big benefit of investing in IBM for exposure to quantum computing is that you're buying a global tech giant that doesn't have all its eggs in one basket. The company is a leader in hybrid cloud computing and enterprise AI, and it has a vast enterprise client base with relationships that span decades. Quantum computing could eventually be a big business for IBM, but even if the technology fails to live up to the hype, IBM is positioned to thrive.\n\nFor a low-risk quantum computing stock, IBM is the way to go.\n\nMaking major breakthroughs\n\nAnother tech giant making waves in the quantum computing space is Alphabet. Back in 2019, Alphabet used a 53-qubit quantum computer to perform a calculation in a few minutes that would have taken an estimated 10,000 years on a massive cluster of traditional computers. The specific calculation wasn't useful in any way, but the achievement was notable, nonetheless.\n\nOne of the biggest problems that quantum computers must still overcome to be useful for real-world computations is error correction. Qubits are fragile, and all sorts of things, including thermal fluctuations or even cosmic rays, can introduce errors that derail a computation. While quantum computing researchers still have a lot of work to do in this area, Alphabet announced a major breakthrough last month.\n\nUsing its Willow quantum chip, Alphabet demonstrated that it could reduce errors exponentially as it scaled up the number of qubits. An increase in errors as a quantum computer is scaled up is one thing that's been preventing systems with many hundreds or thousands of qubits from being built. With Willow, Alphabet was able to push the error rate down as it raised the qubit count.\n\nWillow was also able to solve a specific computation, again not useful in the real world, in five minutes rather than the 10 septillion years a traditional supercomputer would have taken. It may still be many years before Alphabet's quantum computers can solve a useful problem faster than a traditional computer, but it's putting the building blocks in place today.\n\nLike IBM, Alphabet is a relatively low-risk way to bet on quantum computing. Useful quantum computers could be a big deal for Alphabet if it can apply them to tricky problems in AI, search, and other areas where the company operates. However, if the technology doesn't pan out or if it takes decades to push the field forward, Alphabet will still be a leader in digital advertising, cloud computing, and AI, and some of its other moonshots could pay off.\n\nFor a quantum computing stock with a quicker growth rate than IBM that's still not overly risky, Alphabet is a good choice.",

            "content": "Goldman Sachs unveiled a slew of buy-rated stocks with major upside ahead of earnings. The firm said it likes companies with room for growth and attractive valuations. CNBC Pro combed through Goldman Sachs' research to find stocks worth snapping up going into quarterly results. They include Monster Beverage , Uber Technologies, IBM and Bill.com. Uber Technologies Analyst Eric Sheridan urged investors to remain calm on shares of the ride-sharing company ahead of Uber's earnings report on Feb. 5 . He acknowledged in a recent note to clients that autonomous vehicle uncertainty remains, but Sheridan also said that shares are too compelling to ignore. The analyst thinks there are \"multiple pathways to generate an attractive multi-year IRR [internal rate of return] without the need for multiple expansion by buying UBER shares as the company grows EPS nearly 30%/yr through 2026.\" Additionally, the firm likes Uber's profitability setup, free cash flow potential and margin upside. \"We reiterate our Buy rating and $96 12-month PT as we see UBER presenting the best risk-reward in our large-cap coverage with stock price performance & valuation dislocated from earnings power,\" Sheridan said. Uber shares are up more than 7% over the past year. Bill.com The payment fintech company is firing on all cylinders ahead of earnings in early February . Analyst Will Nance and team recently upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing a slew of positive catalysts in 2025. In particular, Goldman Sachs said it sees \"strong revisions over the course of the year against the company's conservative forecast,\" with macro overhang concerns subsiding. Bill.com is also well positioned to benefit from enhanced business confidence and reduced inflation, with client capture trends on the rise, the firm added. \"The improving macro, in addition to BILL's success in onboarding larger customers, positions the stock well for improving C2025 volume trends,\" Nance wrote. Shares of the company are up 28% over the last 12 months. IBM Analyst James Schneider is standing by the stock amidst a host of positive catalysts in the weeks ahead. The company is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Jan. 29 , but Schneider is also bullish on IBM's investor day on Feb. 4. Schneider said investors should pay close attention to IBM's software announcements. \"We think the stock could continue to move higher if the company is able to articulate a credible strategy for sustaining accelerating long-term Software revenue growth,\" he wrote. IBM is \"squarely focused on continuing to build out its portfolio of hybrid cloud Infrastructure Software solutions targeting large enterprise customers,\" the analyst added. IBM shares are up more than 2% this year. \"We think the stock can re-rate as software mix improves and IBM demonstrates consistent financial performance,\" Schneider said. IBM \"We expect IBM to maintain its focus on Software M & A & we believe the company is squarely focused on continuing to build out its portfolio of hybrid cloud Infrastructure Software solutions targeting large enterprise customers. \u2026 We think the stock can re-rate as software mix improves and IBM demonstrates consistent financial performance. \u2026 We think the stock could continue to move higher if the company is able to articulate a credible strategy for sustaining accelerating long-term Software revenue growth.\" Monster Beverage \"We continue to believe MNST has meaningful room to grow gross profit dollars (and improve gross margins) through a combination of incremental topline growth opportunities from strong innovation & pricing, while moderating input costs provide a clear line of sight to GM recovery, which ultimately we think should serve as a positive catalyst and support a further re-rating of the stock.\" Uber Technologies \"While the AV theme will likely remain an overhang, we believe investors have multiple pathways to generate an attractive multi-year IRR without the need for multiple expansion by buying UBER shares as the company grows EPS nearly 30%/yr through 2026. \u2026 We reiterate our Buy rating & $96 12-month PT as we see UBER presenting best risk-reward in our large-cap coverage with stock price performance & valuation dislocated from earnings power.\" Bill.com \"Conversely, we are upgrading BILL, which we believe should see strong revisions over the course of the year against the company's conservative forecast, and believe that fewer macro overhangs should be a tailwind to valuation. \u2026 The improving macro, in addition to BILL's success in onboarding larger customers, positions the stock well for improving C2025 volume trends.\"",

According to him, the project would help keep \u201cthe future of technology\u201d in the US. However, a Bloomberg report reveals how Elon Musk is openly questioning whether the companies that have joined Trump\u2019s announcement, promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, could follow through on them.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nCould this be a sign of an early difference of opinion within the White House? Only hours after the announcement, Musk took to his platform, X, to reveal that the companies don\u2019t have the funds.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money. SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority\u201d.\n\nContrary to Musk\u2019s claims, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, had his own statements to make on X. Altman posted that Musk\u2019s claims are wrong and that he has been upset because this initiative could compete with his Elon Musk\u2019s own AI endeavors.\n\n\u201cWrong, as you surely know. Want to come visit the first site already under way? This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you\u2019ll mostly put US first\u201d.\n\nMusk is leading Trump\u2019s government efficiency efforts and will also be advising him on spending. The billionaire, ever since leaving OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018, has been engaged in a feud with Altman. Sources close to Stargate also reveal that they are not sure how Musk has arrived at the figure. According to them, the company is well-positioned to deploy $100 billion.\n\nIn light of this, Bloomberg revealed that Trump has, on several occasions, promoted private-sector investment promises that never went on to materialize. One of these failed promises has been the failed Foxconn factory project which Trump deemed as the \u201cEighth Wonder of the World\u201d.

Designed macros utilize new circuits for supply boosting, read, and write assist techniques. The proposed circuits are evaluated extensively and compared to prior techniques. Statistical simulations are used to predict the benefits of these circuits in the context of dual supply use. Through programmable local clock and wordline (WL) pulsewidths, SRAM cell margins and speeds are demonstrated through hardware measurement. Stability assists as well as dual supply techniques are used to demonstrate how noise can be suppressed during traditional memory operations (single WL on), as well as to support mixed-signal logic block operation (multiple WLs on). Functionality is shown down to a cell supply of 0.45V with an estimated margin/speed of 6 GHz for SRAM cells (High Density-0.026\u03bcm2, and High Current -0.032\u03bc m2).\u201d\n\nFind the technical paper here.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence.\n\nA prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDubbed the \u201cOperator\u201d, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields.\n\n\u201cThis capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications\u201d. \u2013 OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\nOpenAI says Operator is \u201can agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you\u201d. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations.\n\nThe company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows.\n\n\u201cOperator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it\u201d. \u2013 OpenAI.\n\nBased on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention.\n\n\u201cAI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we\u2019re going to see it take off\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company that offers consulting services and a suite of AI software products. On January 23, JPMorgan Brian Essex raised the firm\u2019s price target on IBM to $233 from $227 and kept a \u201cHold\u201d rating on the shares. The firm expects strong performance from International Business Machines\u2019 (NYSE:IBM) AI and software segments, which will hopefully perform well in the upcoming quarter. This strong momentum, however, may be offset by weakness in the Consulting and Infrastructure divisions. Despite challenges with the company, its stock\u2019s valuation reflects confidence for the growth potential of IBM\u2019s Software business as well as growing demand for its AI platform. Even then, broader strength is needed across its segments for further gains.\n\nOverall, IBM ranks 4th on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "IBM Distinguished Engineer John Knickerbocker has worked on next-generation semiconductor packaging technologies at IBM for over 42 years. Working in this area for this long, he's not only seen the field change dramatically, but he's also had his fair share of projects that didn't pan out. Sometimes the tools needed for the work simply didn't exist. Sometimes industry partners didn't agree on a path forward. And other times, it turned out that a project seemed like a failure, but in fact laid the groundwork for new opportunities that didn't become clear until years later. Regardless of outcomes, Knickerbocker and his colleagues have relied on their curiosity and industriousness to invent new processes out of necessity, changing the field of microelectronics as they went.\n\nKnickerbocker's work at IBM Research has focused on (but isn't limited to) electronic packaging, including advances in fine-pitch and multi-chip integration, and heterogeneous integration technologies \u2014 all of which help power IBM's core technologies of systems products, hybrid cloud computing, generative AI, and quantum computing. He has also worked on precision smartphone components, healthcare applications, and diagnostic sensors.\n\nAlong the way, Knickerbocker has helped pioneer technologies for assembling and handling sensitive microelectronic components, developing new ways to shrink the size of chips, substrates, and batteries, and increase chip-to-chip and chip-to-package interconnections. He's been involved with making more connections per unit area from a chip, stacking chips, increasing connections at the edge of chips, and handling fragile thinned silicon wafers, chips, and packaging components that are all a fraction of the thickness of a single hair. In the process, he helped author hundreds of patents and directly contributed to shipping over a billion micro-electric components.\n\nMost recently, Knickerbocker and his colleagues unveiled an interconnect technology for co-packaged optics. This breakthrough brings fiber-optic connections to the edge of chips in data centers, which can reduce the energy costs of current generative AI computing by an estimated 50% compared to conventional electrical wiring. Co-packaged optics also increases the communication bandwidth among GPUs by 1,000% and supports longer GPU-to-GPU communication distances within a data center, with the potential to massively speed up large model training.\n\nJohn Knickerbocker (right) and Hsianghan Hsu (left) inspect a polymer optical waveguide module under a microscope at IBM Research's global headquarters in Yorktown Heights, New York.\n\nLife's necessities\n\nBut these high-tech achievements grew out of low-tech beginnings. Knickerbocker grew up on a small farm in upstate New York, the sixth child out of eight. \"We were all taught at an early age that you will help the family,\" he said. \"You will work on the farm \u2014 whatever is needed.\" His older siblings taught him how to carry out the duties that kept the farm running. \"We didn't have a lot of money, but we had family,\" recalled Knickerbocker. It didn't hurt that he loved the challenge of learning new skills like planting the garden, maintaining cars, and repairing lawnmower engines.\n\nBeyond household chores, Knickerbocker and his siblings were encouraged to earn additional money on their own. Their parents emphasized that they would go to college, and they would need to pay their own way through scholarships and working to save money.\n\nTheir home's fertile soil also provided an opportunity to make money. Knickerbocker estimated his family vegetable garden was about 6 to 8 acres, and the family canned and froze home-grown vegetables to eat beyond the growing season. Some of their excess produce went to churches, family, and friends. But the kids also sold veggies to earn money for college.\n\n\"My brother and I were entrepreneurial from an early age,\" he said, \"going down the street with a little wagon, two bushel baskets in it full of tomatoes, corn, and squash to sell.\"\n\nTo this day, Knickerbocker maintains a love of farming: Each year he grows over 100 tomato plants from seed, keeping his family, friends, and neighbors well fed with salads and sauces from July to November every year. And while farming remains a passion, his blossoming love for technology meant that academics were always at the forefront for him.\n\nLanding at IBM\n\nKnickerbocker's skills in math and science made him stand out in school. In his first year as an undergraduate at the State University of New York (SUNY) Alfred, he spent his January term doing lab work on ceramics chemistry. By the time he was a sophomore, he was teaching the course \u2014 a role usually reserved for graduate students.\n\nUpon graduating he stuck around SUNY Alfred for another year to do his masters, then went on to do a Ph.D. in materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. When he finished his postdoc year in 1983, he had plenty of job offers.\n\nBut he really wanted to work for IBM. IBM's technical work with semiconductors and advanced packaging technology seemed a good fit for his skills and interests, plus he saw IBM as a leader in advanced research and development that was actually making its way to products \u2014 a factor that was especially important in Knickerbocker's eyes. Plus, it didn't hurt that he'd spoken to researchers who gave him the impression that IBMers were friendly, motivated, and team oriented.\n\nIn the lab, John Knickerbocker carefully handled polymer optical waveguide modules. These connectors, which promise to reduce the time and energy required by AI model training, are one of his latest collaborations.\n\n\"I didn't see anything from IBM, though, so I called up someone who had come to speak when I was in college, and I asked if there were any jobs,\" recalled Knickerbocker. He ended up receiving two different offers from IBM: one at IBM's then-headquarters in Endicott, New York, and one at IBM Microelectronics in East Fishkill, New York. After some negotiating, he ended up in East Fishkill, where he started working on multi-layer ceramic packaging. \"We had developed new technologies that didn't exist at the time,\" said Knickerbocker. \"So it was new tools, new materials, new processes \u2014 everything needed to be compatible with the product application requirements.\"\n\nSince these beginnings, Knickerbocker has spent more than four decades at IBM \u2014 his entire career so far \u2014 including the past 20 years at IBM Research. But this path wasn't inevitable.\n\nEarly on he'd considered being a medical doctor, among other things. \"I thought about being a contractor, but I'd go broke because I'd take longer than estimated,\" he said. \"I'm too much of a perfectionist that way.\" He still does construction as a hobby, with an impressive repertoire including designing and building garages, stone fireplaces, and homeroom additions. He's done framing, plumbing, electrical, and roofing, and even added a floor, raising a house up a level. \"Seeing the progress on these projects is enjoyable,\" he said. \"It's a nice diversion from the day-to-day.\" He'd also considered being a forest ranger and, of course, a farmer. But as a young man he decided none of those careers would be a great fit for him in the long run, so he chose the life of a semiconductor electronic packaging engineer.\n\nEngineering collaboration\n\nKnickerbocker is first and foremost an engineer, but throughout his time at IBM he's also become an expert at working with clients to make sure that what he's making will meet their needs \u2014 not just a product that works, but one that can be scaled up to manufacturing quantities, adhere to a schedule, hit a specific cost point, and compete in the marketplace. And with the recent co-packaged optics breakthrough, the team's announcement was as much about sharing results as it was about getting these client conversations rolling. After all, their input will affect where our collaborative research goes.\n\nI want to make things that make a difference for people.\n\n\"One of the most valuable things I can do is talk to potential clients and understand what their needs are,\" said Knickerbocker. For him, the value lies in moving from a concept, to demonstrators, to making real products. \"I don't want this to be a research project that ends as a research project, and you walk away. I want to make things that make a difference for people.\" Not everything works out that way, he acknowledged, \"but if you don't work toward that goal, you'll certainly never get there.\"\n\nInternal colleagues, too, can help build the necessary connections, said Knickerbocker, so his relationships with other IBMers are crucial to doing good work. Tech sales staff, for example, relay vital feedback from representatives at client companies. \"We really want to know what would make a difference for them, what would make their product better than what their competitors offer,\" Knickerbocker said. \"It can be an opportunity for a great product for them down the road, and some new developments for us along the way.\"\n\nSince announcing the co-packaged optics breakthrough in December, Knickerbocker and his colleagues began meeting with potential clients to find out what they need from this technology. \"You learn a lot talking to others,\" he said. \"You think you've got it all in hand, but really you don't, because everyone is bringing different needs to the table, plus they want to be competitive.\"\n\nYou learn a lot talking to others. You think you've got it all in hand, but really you don't, because everyone is bringing different needs to the table, plus they want to be competitive.\n\nLearning from failure\n\nNot everything works out, though, said Knickerbocker. In the early 2000s, he and his colleagues spent several years working on variable-focus electronic contact lenses with a client.\n\n\"We just werent firing on all cylinders, and we missed,\" he recalled. The electronics, variable focus lens, and integration for the contact lens all worked, but the battery wasn't to the client's targeted specifications \u2014 specific energy levels with a targeted battery chemistry. Knickerbocker's team followed up with an alternative: a low-cost, rechargeable battery that far exceeded the energy specification. \"We made it successfully, with the thought that we might reset the program schedules,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the research demonstration took a year and a half, and the program could not be reset at that time.\"\n\nAnd yet, this project wasn't a failure. It took advantage of the team's 3D semiconductor electronic technology and fine-pitch interconnection advancements, which had already been shipped and used for wireless cellphone products prior to when the electronic lens project started. The team added multiple complementary strategic inventions along the way, not just for that application, but for potential future applications, too. \"Making components smaller, with higher bandwidth communication and energy efficiency, is a big deal for edge computing and other wired or wireless applications,\" said Knickerbocker.\n\n\"We said if we created differentiation, we could start to think about other industry application enhancements: portable near-field recharge, wireless communication links, power delivery, and very small batteries,\" he said. Their work on miniaturizing electronics and electronic packaging continues to be used for higher bandwidth interconnections between chips, as well as for packaging chips with a much smaller interconnection pitch.\n\nTheir advancements also included pioneering work on silicon interposers and packaging that could be shrunk into many more connections \u2014 many thousands of connections as opposed to a few hundred \u2014 by going to a tighter pitch. As part of their work, they developed the necessary equipment, materials, and processes to safely handle hair-thin silicon wafers with new bonding and de-bonding technologies, and put vertical connections into them with through-silicon vias (TSVs). By 2008, they had built and qualified for production their first TSVs for a device called a power amplifier, which became a crucial low-cost component in major smartphone brands like Apple and Samsung \u2014 eventually shipping billions of units.\n\nAfter more than four decades at IBM, John Knickerbocker's curiosity still keeps him working toward what's next.\n\nA new growing season\n\nSometimes Knickerbocker's work at IBM involves sowing seeds that don't grow quite as planned.\n\nIn our first interview for this profile, I'd asked Knickerbocker for an example of something that didn't work out, and he had told me about the contact lens project. It had been a great project with a great team collaboration, and many challenging technology advancements overcome. But it hadn't kept 100% to schedule, which led to a disappointing program stop. Years had passed since the project ended, and what stuck with him wasn't the scrapped program, but all the things he and his IBM Research colleagues had accomplished along the way.\n\nMuch like his passions at home, the triumph is just as much about the process as it is about the end product. After more than four decades at IBM, Knickerbocker is still just as driven by his curiosity and his eagerness to collaborate as when he first joined. His face lights up, a smile crinkling the corners of his eyes whenever he describes all that he and his colleagues have accomplished.",

            "content": "As AI sweeps through Davos, IBM\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer reveals why so little corporate data is used for AI, why personalization alone won\u2019t save media or marketers and how B2B brands can harness real relevance to break through the noise.\n\nDavos might be better known for its sweeping discussions on geopolitics, but this year, AI overshadowed them all. As global leaders huddled to address a turbulent economic climate, Jonathan Adashek \u2013 IBM\u2019s senior vice-president and chief communications officer (who also oversees marketing) \u2013 noticed a clear shift: many business conversations now revolve around how organizations can practically harness AI.\n\n\u201cPeople have moved further in the journey on AI,\u201d says Adashek. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to figure out, but it\u2019s clear AI is moving quickly in the US and around the world. It can go much faster and it will speed up over time.\u201d\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nA pivotal moment for B2B marketing\n\nAI adoption might be accelerating, but Adashek stresses that success hinges on the right foundations \u2013 especially when it comes to data.\n\n\u201cThe first thing people have to do is get their data in order. A lot of people look at that and say it\u2019s slow, it\u2019s painful. But in fact, you\u2019re making a lot of progress by doing it.\u201d\n\nThe real missed opportunity, he points out, is how little enterprise data is typically harnessed for AI. \u201cI think I saw something the other day that said less than 1% of enterprise data is in large language models today,\u201d he notes, adding that this huge gap underscores the urgency for better data hygiene and systems integration.\n\nHe believes this focus is especially critical for B2B marketers seeking to identify pain points and drive conversion. It\u2019s also part of a broader push at IBM, which Adashek describes as laser-focused on helping organizations leverage hybrid cloud and AI.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at making sure we\u2019re focused on a core set of platforms and a core set of messages \u2013 driving awareness and conversion. Ultimately, we want to help identify pain points and show how AI can be a competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the platforms and messages, though. Skills themselves need continual reinvention. \u201cI read a stat not long ago,\u201d he notes, \u201cthat said the average shelf life of a technology skill is just under three years.\u201d That reality demands a learning culture where teams keep pace with rapidly evolving tools \u2013 and marketing leaders, Adashek adds, must be prepared to invest heavily in upskilling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of training and development that needs to happen and it\u2019s not just for people who are using an AI tool \u2013 it\u2019s for people to operate in an organization that has AI deployed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepositioning IBM: closing the perception gap\n\nIBM\u2019s brand has seen a marked evolution as it aligns itself firmly with hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Yet the company still faces a lingering misconception that it manufactures personal computers and laptops. According to Adashek, an important part of its communications strategy is addressing that perception gap head-on.\n\n\u201cThere are still some people who think we make laptops,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t. The computers we do make are a very small, highly specialized set of mainframes and quantum computers.\u201d\n\nHe notes that much of IBM\u2019s current marketing aims to highlight its true proposition \u2013 providing the technology and advisory services that empower businesses to harness AI and data at scale. By consistently showcasing real-world use cases and quantifiable outcomes, IBM hopes to change outdated assumptions and reinforce its image as a leading hybrid cloud and AI player.\n\nChallenges for media \u2013 and beyond\n\nDavos conversations often touch on how the changing landscape affects not just tech companies but also the media that covers them. Adashek sees media businesses grappling with a fragmented content ecosystem where audiences are overwhelmed by choice.\n\n\u201cI think media companies have to continue on the evolution journey they\u2019re on. There\u2019s more and more content out there and trying to break through that is challenging.\u201d\n\nFor many in the media world, personalized content is considered a powerful solution. But Adashek argues personalization alone won\u2019t suffice: \u201cPeople talk about content that\u2019s personalized, but that doesn\u2019t work if it\u2019s not relevant to what I\u2019m doing. At home, I get letters in the mail addressed to me, telling me I\u2019m approved for some new credit card or car. It\u2019s personalized but not relevant, so I rip it up and throw it away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking relevance the priority\n\nThat distinction between personalization and relevance is crucial and it\u2019s not limited to the media industry. For B2B marketers in particular, simply addressing an email by name or tagging it with an industry code won\u2019t drive meaningful outcomes if the core message doesn\u2019t address the recipient\u2019s genuine needs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be constantly evolving, understanding how to serve content that is not just personalized, but is relevant,\u201d Adashek explains. \u201cThat\u2019s how you break through.\u201d\n\nHe recommends that marketers tie every engagement \u2013 whether it\u2019s a thought leadership piece or a direct marketing push \u2013 to the authentic pain points of their customers. That approach, he says, helps maintain a brand\u2019s authority and value in a world where even advanced AI can be just noise if not applied with purpose.\n\nA steady drumbeat toward the future\n\nAdashek\u2019s own journey, from a strong communications background to leading IBM\u2019s marketing, illustrates how essential it is for marketers to keep learning. He advises newcomers and veterans alike: \u201cTake the time to learn the business in more detail, understand what drives the revenue and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.\u201d\n\nAt Davos \u2013 a hub for major strategic shifts \u2013 it\u2019s clear AI is fueling many corporate transformations. Yet Adashek believes a consistent message and a relentless focus on real business outcomes remain the ultimate ways to cut through the hype: \u201cIf we stay focused on delivering real outcomes and helping clients understand their data, we\u2019ll break through. The technology might change, but the fundamentals of solving problems and meeting customer needs stay the same.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a resonant point for B2B marketers under pressure to demonstrate immediate ROI while also positioning themselves for a fast-changing future. Here at Davos, that future feels closer than ever \u2013 and if Adashek\u2019s observations hold true, the race to stay relevant has only just begun.",

And while not a traditional ERP provider, Persefoni offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that integrates with existing ERP systems, such as SAP or Oracle. Their solution automates the calculation, management, and reporting of carbon usage data, enabling companies to monitor emissions and meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance goals.\n\nAI is transforming the jobs of product designers within consumer product companies. As is the case with L\u2019Oreal\u2019s collaboration with IBM, AI tools will analyze the carbon footprint of materials and suggest sustainable alternatives (e.g., EC3\u2019s AI-driven sustainability reports). And GenAI can help redesign packaging to minimize material usage while maintaining aesthetic appeal. AI-driven trend analysis tools (e.g., Stylumia, Heuritech) will predict consumer preferences and design trends based on social media, sales data, and competitor movements. GenAI tools like DALL\u00b7E and Adobe Firefly will assist in quickly generating mood boards, product sketches, and packaging concepts. And AI will analyze historical design success rates to suggest product improvements. AI will automate CAD modeling and prototyping with tools like Autodesk\u2019s AI-powered Dreamcatcher, allowing for rapid iterations. AI-generated material optimization models will suggest eco-friendly, cost-effective materials based on product specifications. And virtual testing through AI simulations will predict durability, sustainability, and manufacturability before a physical prototype is made. Collectively, these advancements are estimated to drive 50% faster product development cycles, cost reductions, and more sustainable design choices. AI will enable hyper-personalized product designs that adapt to individual preferences (e.g., AI-assisted custom skincare formulas, 3D-printed custom footwear). And tools like Zoe AI for beauty and Nike By You\u2019s AI-powered customization will make it easier to design consumer-specific products at scale.",

One year ago, IBM Consulting rolled out our AI-powered delivery platform IBM Consulting Advantage. It acts as a workbench for our consultants to use AI agents, assistants and applications to augment their daily work supporting clients.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone from 0 to over 85,000 users and growing. We have over 2,000 assistants and agents and more than 60 industry and domain specific applications, including solutions that support and integrate technology from strategic partners like Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce and SAP. Plus, we\u2019re seeing up to 50% productivity gained across various consulting tasks.[1]\n\nThis adoption is a direct result of making the platform \u201csticky,\u201d which matters because it means we can deliver better and faster client results at a lower cost, and we can help clients achieve stickiness internally too.\n\nHere are four keys to stickiness based on lessons learned from our own transformation plus our experience collaborating with thousands of enterprises, from Riyadh Air to Dun & Bradstreet, to scale AI responsibly and sustainably.\n\nEmbed AI into employees\u2019 natural flow of work.\n\nSuccessful adoption depends on a user experience designed to help employees get work done, within the processes and tools they use every day.\n\nFor example, consultants use repeatable methods to execute work consistently, like a cloud migration factory method with specific steps to accelerate how consultants migrate a client\u2019s applications to the cloud. We\u2019ve curated bundles of capabilities in IBM Consulting Advantage and embedded them within the specific steps in the method where they can provide the most added value.\n\nWe\u2019ve also developed plug-ins between IBM Consulting Advantage and popular integrated development environments like Microsoft VScode and IntelliJ. This means our consultants who are building and testing code can use the power of AI within the familiar applications they use every day.\n\nCultivate a growth mindset.\n\nAlmost every process can be improved with the right ideas, talent and resources. Cultivate a growth mindset within your teams and encourage them to continually innovate and find new applications for AI.\n\nWe\u2019re constantly adding new capabilities to IBM Consulting Advantage based on the challenges we see clients facing today and anticipate in the future.\n\nFor example, we're seeing increasing need for smaller, curated foundation models that can help with complex industry-specific tasks, such as achieving compliance with industry standards or modernizing code within the constraints of a highly regulated industry. These models need to be customizable with client data, easily orchestrated with agents and small enough to be easily hosted and deployed via on-premise cloud.\n\nWe\u2019re building one-of-a-kind industry specialized datasets that can be used in combination with the novel InstructLab approach to train targeted foundation models for industry tasks. We\u2019re starting with the banking industry, in close collaboration with the Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN). We\u2019ve also begun to engage clients on applications of this solution, making them part of the innovation process.\n\nEstablish trust.\n\nEmployees need targeted training to use AI most effectively. They need to be empowered to ask questions about AI\u2019s outputs, source data and more, so they can feel confident in what AI is producing for them. This is especially important as AI agents, which can come up with a plan and execute it autonomously, become more prevalent. And organizations need to establish feedback loops with employees to understand what\u2019s working with these tools, what\u2019s not, or other ways they could be applied.\n\nIn IBM Consulting, in addition to providing targeted training on AI for consultants, we solicit feedback via open comment boards, slack channels and regular user interviews and research. That helps inform future platform capabilities.\n\nMake employees creators.\n\nRight now, many employees still see generative AI as something that\u2019s happening to them, not as something that works for them. So how do we make people feel like they\u2019re part of the solution?\n\nPart of the key is an employee culture that embraces change. Find the technology pain points that inspire people to push back or find workarounds, and improve that experience. Establish psychological safety nets so people don\u2019t fear automating themselves out of a job but instead see the tools as an opportunity for their career growth. Lastly, focus on making your people creators, because the people closest to the work often have the best ideas about where and how AI can provide value.\n\nWith IBM Consulting Advantage, any consultant can create and train an AI assistant to solve a problem, and that assistant can then be shared and up-voted by peers who want to recommend it for others to use.\n\nLooking ahead into 2025, those business leaders who can make AI \u201csticky\u201d in their organizations and combine the powerful technology with human expertise and behavior change will be the best positioned to see their AI investments bear fruit.",

            "content": "Identifying high-risk fire zones is just the first step. As fires become potentially more frequent and intense, researchers are racing to develop AI systems to predict where fires might start and how they will spread.\n\nUniversity of Southern California researchers have developed an AI model known as a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (cWGAN), initially trained on simulated data under ideal conditions. The system was then tested on California wildfires between 2020 and 2022, analyzing patterns influenced by weather, fuel and terrain.\n\nThe research comes as agencies are already deploying AI in the field. Austin Energy has deployed an AI-powered network of cameras across central Texas that automatically scans for signs of wildfire, aiming to spot blazes before they spread. The system uses 13 high-definition cameras that continuously monitor a 437-square-mile area, alerting firefighters with location data and live images when smoke is detected.\n\nOther companies are racing to develop similar detection systems with extended capabilities. Brad Listerman, Founder & CEO of Los Angeles-based PriviNet, is developing AI-powered sensor networks that could run on battery power for a year or longer with solar power. His company is finalizing prototypes and gearing up to launch its debut product.\n\n\"Unless you're going to have the bandwidth of wifi or 5G spreading throughout, you need to have low-powered sensors on the ground,\" Listerman says. His system would incorporate multiple detection methods to identify fire risks, including infrared sensors, heat detection devices and an array of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that would alert users to suspicious activity. Cameras would then provide visual verification of the situation through photographs.\n\nThe technology relies on LoRaWAN, a free network that can work over distances up to 10 kilometers. \"The really important thing is, how do you keep low-power devices on there, and then how do you get that information out?\" Listerman says.\n\nThe challenge of collecting and analyzing environmental data is one that major tech companies are also tackling. IBM and NASA have developed a geospatial foundation model, available on Hugging Face, that can help scientists estimate the extent of past wildfires. The model is part of a broader collaboration to make climate and weather applications more accessible, with future developments aimed at identifying conditions that could lead to wildfires.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.74 per share, indicating a change of -3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.61 indicates a change of +4.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",

I do pay national insurance on those amounts.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"I have a son [who is] off to university. Your mortgage doesn't go down because you are sick.\n\n\"I had to use all my savings to bring this case and more and had to borrow money on a credit card\u2026 it's left me financially very vulnerable.\"\n\nClifford said he was aware people would 'still think its greedy', however, he believed he was entitled to more cash as 'that was a benefit he got with the job'.\n\nDespite launching a legal battle against IBM, he explained he had always considered himself as a 'company man'.\n\nEmployment Judge Paul Housego, who dismissed the case, told Clifford 'it is not disability discrimination that the plan is not even more generous' than he wanted.\n\n\"Even if the value of the \u00a350,000 a year halved over 30 years, it is still a very substantial benefit,\" Judge Housego said.",

            "content": "International Business Machines' (IBM 0.03%) strategy centers around hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). In the cloud computing market, IBM's acquisition of Red Hat forms the foundation of its hybrid cloud platform. For large companies and organizations looking to modernize their infrastructures and applications, aiming to save money, remove the burden of legacy tech, or deploy new technologies like AI, IBM's hybrid cloud platform offers a path forward.\n\nIBM's strategy in AI is similar. The company launched its watsonx AI platform last year, providing enterprise clients with a platform for developing, training, deploying, and managing AI models and agents. Since that launch, IBM has booked about $3 billion worth of business related to AI and is now adding more than $1 billion of new business each quarter.\n\nWhile these software platforms are at the center of IBM's overall strategy, it's the consulting business that's ultimately doing a lot of work. Large organizations need not only software but also guidance, solutions, implementation, and other services as they go through complex and prolonged modernization efforts. A company with on-premises servers running outdated applications needs a lot of help transitioning to a hybrid cloud architecture and deploying new AI workloads.\n\nRemember that $3 billion of AI-related business? About 80% of that total was consulting bookings, with the rest coming from software. IBM's consulting business is a key differentiator for the company as it goes after the hybrid cloud computing and enterprise AI markets.\n\nA smart acquisition\n\nOne important aspect of IBM's consulting business is that it's free to construct solutions for clients involving non-IBM products and services. Through a wide range of partnerships, IBM's consulting arm builds solutions involving competing cloud platforms, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AWZN) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and competing software from companies like Oracle. This agnosticism is one reason IBM's consulting business works.\n\nOn Thursday, IBM announced that it planned to acquire Applications Software Technology, a global Oracle consultancy. IBM competes with Oracle in multiple areas, but the company also recognizes that armies of potential customers currently use Oracle software. By serving those customers and their Oracle-related needs, IBM can bring in new clients and potentially sell them additional products and services down the road.\n\nBecause much of Oracle's software is mission-critical, a client going through a modernization effort is likely to stick with Oracle software. With this acquisition, IBM broadens its ability to serve those clients.\n\nBetting on partnerships\n\nIBM's growing collection of strategic partnerships, like the partnership with Oracle, is bringing in billions of dollars in business that IBM otherwise wouldn't win. In the cloud computing market, these partnerships are particularly important. While IBM has its own public cloud platform, a potential client will most likely want to use AWS, Azure, or some combination of the two. By building solutions that involve the technology clients want or need, IBM opens the door to far more business than it would otherwise win.\n\nWhile IBM stock trades near its all-time high, the company is performing well as its platform and consulting strategies pay off. The company expects to generate in excess of $12 billion in free cash flow this year, and that number has the potential to grow further in the years ahead. Based on that forecast, IBM stock trades for about 17 times free cash flow.\n\nThis Oracle consultancy acquisition may not be a major development, but it's another step that drives the company's consulting strategy forward. As enterprises race to modernize, IBM is increasing its appeal as the partner of choice.",

            "content": "Increased alignment and financial agility\n\nAccording to Kasamale, prior to implementing Apptio, The Standard struggled to dynamically size opportunities for shifting spending to strategic areas. \u201cIt was hard for us to hold off spending in one area in order to prioritize another,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe leadership team didn\u2019t have enough insights on discretionary spending capacity to drive more efficient prioritization of funds across IT functions or portfolios, and this caused portfolio budget overages for several years.\u201d\n\nTo shift their focus accordingly, Apptio introduced The Standard to a standardized cost model alongside investment, project, product, labor, and planning tools. The new model has enabled The Standard\u2019s IT Finance team to focus 80% of their time on analysis, decision support, forecasting, and insights. Apptio has also enabled the leadership team to more confidently shift funding to accomplish objectives and more consistently achieve financial targets in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe quality of financial plan segmentation and insights raised the bar for budget analytics and storytelling,\u201d Kasamale says. \u201cThey had never seen anything like this before. The level of maturity of our financial planning process and feedback on our results has been off the charts since we deployed Apptio.\u201d\n\nMore control over cloud spending\n\nThe Standard also uses Cloudability to increase visibility into cloud spending, a rapidly growing area of spending driven primarily by digital transformation and core infrastructure services. This has given the company\u2019s product and application leaders valuable insight that has helped them make better decisions about cloud purchases and drive accountability.\n\nAccording to Kasamale, the company\u2019s Azure footprint had increased by five times in three years. However, using Cloudability to sort through actionable Azure rightsizing opportunities uncovered potential savings, leading to changes in the company\u2019s cloud environments which are projected to reduce the company\u2019s cloud spend in 2023 by 10%\u2014and 2024 looks even better.\n\n\u201cThe biggest payoff is to the trajectory for 2024,\u201d Kasamale shares. \u201cWe were facing a 30% increase in organic Azure growth in a year and we also renegotiated rates with Microsoft. With all the optimizations that we have done to date, coupled with decisions that have influenced changes to data architecture, we are on track to absorb the effects of organic growth and are better positioned to negotiate our purchasing renewal.\u201d\n\nBetter resource and program management\n\nDigital transformation is and will continue to be part of The Standard\u2019s business strategy. But managing delivery teams working on transformation initiatives was challenging, given the organization\u2019s holding company structure and centralized delivery approach.\n\n\u201cOur development teams are dispersed,\u201d says Kaarina Bourquin, Senior Director, IT Strategy and Portfolio at The Standard. \u201cWhile we do Agile delivery, we also do waterfall. We need tools and processes that can provide operational insights, regardless of delivery methodology.\u201d\n\nBourquin added that it was important for teams to find a common language among delivery methodologies. The teams needed to see what they were being asked to do both now and in the future to understand where to invest from a capabilities standpoint and to deliver the work in an optimized way.\n\n\u201cWe have a mixture of dedicated and shared teams,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have multiple portfolios across multiple lines of business. We must figure out capacity and sequencing across this mix and plan the work that needs to get done, which includes portfolio investment, operations, and maintenance. Visibility is important to us.\u201d\n\nFrom an operational perspective, then, the organization needed a better way to manage its strategy-to-value-delivery lifecycle, taking into consideration both product-oriented work and project-oriented work, to ensure business leaders worked collaboratively despite the organizational complexity.\n\nThis was one of the main reasons the company looked at Targetprocess. The other had a lot to do with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe were scrambling to figure out how to do big room planning virtually,\u201d Bourquin recalls. \u201cHow do we take these exercises, which are heavily in-person centric, and move them to a virtual environment?\u201d\n\nAccording to Bourquin, they implemented Targetprocess to help them align team workstreams to business priorities. In turn, this created transparency, helped identify risks or impediments, and ultimately gave the team visibility into consolidated workflows that showed them the information about active or completed projects including status, stakeholders, relevant dependencies, committed work, and progress.\n\n\u201cOur say-do ratio\u2014what we as an IT organization say we will do versus what we actually deliver\u2014is important,\u201d Bourquin explains. \u201cTargetprocess has definitely made it easier for us to consistently measure that.\u201d The say-do ratio increased by 20%, an improvement that goes beyond delivering more; it revolves around shared visibility into commitments, enabling the team to efficiently manage distractions and achieve tasks faster.\n\nAllocating resources and tracking the status of work are only two of the benefits the company has received so far. Bourquin says they also have started to use Targetprocess to maintain a list of strategic initiatives, as a tool to help them add new ideas to the portfolio funnel, and to create requests for resource assignments.\n\n\u201cStrategic portfolio management is a big focus for us right now,\u201d she declares. \u201cThis is where I see the value of Targetprocess increasing for us. When I think about planning for enterprise, portfolios, programs, or projects, I think about Targetprocess.\u201d\n\nNext steps and advice to others\n\nWhen asked about advice for others who may be in the early stages of their TBM journey, Kasamale\u2019s answer is straightforward, \u201cDon\u2019t wait. You can get started quickly just with agile budget reporting and spending segmentation while using the core foundational components of Apptio. And that will help your leaders understand how to shift budget from run to funding grow-and-transform initiatives.\u201d\n\nFrom fully integrating strategic portfolio management to establishing complete chargeback capabilities, The Standard considers the IBM solutions to be an instrumental platform for the organization and is looking for applications to help drive significant business results in the future.\n\n\u201cThe IBM solutions have been indispensable tools for helping our IT leaders solve pressing issues around transparency, financial agility, and transformation,\u201d Kasamale says. \u201cThere are so many challenges IT leaders must navigate today\u2014not being able to understand or tell their financial story to the business area should not be one of them.\u201d",

And his LinkedIn profile showed him as \u2018medically retired\u2019 from 2013.\n\nIn that year, the man raised a grievance with the company, complaining he hadn\u2019t received any pay rise over five years.\n\nHe went after more. (LinkedIn)\n\nClifford managed to reach a \u2018compromise agreement\u2019 with his employer, meaning he was put onto its disability plan which prevented him from being dismissed.\n\nAdvert\n\nTherefore, the man remained as an IBM employee with \u2018no obligation to work\u2019.\n\nUnder this health plan, workers have the right to earn three-quarters of their agreed earnings. So, the man got an annual pay of \u00a354,028 which he could keep getting until he hits 65. Yep, with some maths, that would mean he\u2019d be paid about \u00a31.5 million while on \u2018sick leave\u2019.\n\nHowever, Clifford wasn\u2019t best pleased over the amount not budging over the past decade so decided to sue.\n\nIn February 2022, he took IBM to an employment tribunal on claims of disability discrimination, with a similar grievance to the last time he raised concerns.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe man said he had been treated 'unfavourably' as he'd received no salary increase since 2013 and warned the 'value of the payments would soon wither' due to punishingly high levels of inflation.\n\nHe said: \"The point of the plan was to give security to employees not able to work - that was not achieved if payments were forever frozen.\"\n\nThe judge didn't rule in his favour. (SILAS STEIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut it didn\u2019t quite go how he hopes as the employment tribunal in Reading dismissed his claim. Clifford has told that he was getting a 'very substantial benefit' and receiving 'favourable treatment'.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Active employees may get pay rises, but inactive employees do not, is a difference, but is not, in my judgement, a detriment caused by something arising from disability,\" employment Judge Paul Housego said in his dismissal of the case.\n\n\"The complaint is in fact that the benefit of being an inactive employee on the Plan is not generous enough, because the payments have been at a fixed level since April 6, 2013, now 10 years, and may remain so.\n\n\"The claim is that the absence of increase in salary is disability discrimination because it is less favourable treatment than afforded those not disabled.\n\n\"This contention is not sustainable because only the disabled can benefit from the plan.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"It is not disability discrimination that the Plan is not even more generous.\n\n\"Even if the value of the \u00a350,000 a year halved over 30 years, it is still a very substantial benefit.\"",

            "content": "The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend stocks selected for their reliable dividend payments and strong financial fundamentals. In any income-focused strategy, investors typically aim for both yield and capital appreciation. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have consistently provided higher yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their benchmarks. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, between June 30, 2001, and June 30, 2023, the total return of the index, assuming dividends were reinvested, averaged 11.7% annually, outperforming the Dow Jones US Broad Stock Market Index, which returned 10.2% during the same period.\n\nInvesting in high-yielding Dow Jones stocks can be an appealing strategy for those seeking reliable income and potentially higher returns. When selecting dividend stocks for their portfolios, investors often focus on dividend yields. However, it's important to recognize that companies with high yields but lacking financial stability may be at risk of cutting dividends, especially amid global economic challenges and rising interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies that target high yields should also emphasize the financial strength and stability of the companies involved.\n\nWhen comparing the Dow to the broader market, the Dow has also shown strong results. According to S&P Global, from the past 30 years up until June 2021, the market returned 10.6%, while the Dow slightly exceeded that with an 11.16% return. This outperformance is largely due to the Dow's stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and steady yields.\n\nToday, tech stocks have dominated the market, as seen by the NASDAQ's nearly 30% gain over the past year, outperforming both the Dow and the broader market. However, the Dow's underperformance in this period contrasts with its historical performance. A report from Barron\u2019s highlighted that in 1978, 1980, and 1992, the Dow outpaced the Nasdaq by at least seven percentage points. The most notable period of Dow dominance occurred during the dot-com bubble's collapse, with 12 instances of outperformance between 1999 and 2002.\n\nDow is one of the most well-known and influential stock market indices globally. It monitors the performance of 30 publicly traded companies on US stock exchanges, covering a broad array of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by over 15%, compared with a nearly 25% return of the broader market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks in the Dow . In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other high yield dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhen evaluating dividend yields, many investors adopt the 'Dogs of the Dow' strategy, which involves picking the ten Dow stocks with the highest dividend yields. While this strategy hasn't performed well in recent years, it has historically outpaced its benchmark over the long term. Michael O'Higgins discovered that, over a 26-year period, a hypothetical portfolio of high-dividend Dow stocks achieved an annualized return of 17.9%. This performance outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s annualized return of 13% during the same period. According to the Wall Street Journal, the investment strategy outperformed the DJIA in 2022 for the first time since 2018. This happened as investors turned to safer options amidst the market's unpredictable swings. Given this, we will take a look at some of the highest yielding dividend stocks in the Dow.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we examined the companies within the Dow Jones index and identified 13 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of January 16. It's worth noting that the majority of companies in the Dow Jones are dividend payers. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Integrates Granite LLMs into Lockheed Martin's AI Factory\"\n\nA closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nDividend Yield as of January 16: 3.02%\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an American multinational tech company that focuses on developing business-class systems tailored for use by other organizations. The company recently announced its plans to acquire Applications Software Technology, a global consulting firm specializing in solutions for the Oracle Cloud Applications Suite. IBM stated that this acquisition will enhance its expertise in the public sector and Oracle Cloud Applications, enabling clients to navigate their business transformations with greater confidence.\n\nUnlike many other AI companies, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) focuses on securing long-term subscription and technical support contracts rather than making quick sales. The setup process can be slow, especially for complex projects like establishing generative AI systems. In the spring of 2023, IBM launched its generative AI platform, watsonx. By the following year, watsonx had secured over $2 billion in multiyear contracts. Just one quarter later, the order book for watsonx grew by an additional $1 billion, marking a 50% increase in just three months, which is considered a tipping point. Over time, the company will convert these paper contracts into cash sales while continuing to sign more AI deals.\n\nIn addition to its AI platform, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s dividend history also makes it an appealing investment option. The company has remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning $1.5 billion to investors through dividends in the most recent quarter. Moreover, it maintains a 29-year streak of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.02%, as of January 16.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2024, 56 hedge funds owned stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), up from 54 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The overall value of these stakes is over $1.7 billion. With nearly 2.6 million shares, Holocene Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall IBM ranks 7th on our list of the highest yielding dividend stocks in the Dow. While we acknowledge the potential for IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "As artificial intelligence has grown out of the lab and into all areas of our lives, it\u2019s become clear that we need to find new ways to make this technology do more with less computing power. For large language models to be viable for businesses, they can\u2019t require hundreds of GPUs to run. One option includes low-precision computing. Sometimes called approximate computing, low-precision arithmetic is well suited for AI applications whose computations don\u2019t require a high degree of precision to produce accurate enough results. Its advantages include reduced compute and energy costs, as well as lower latency.\n\nDeveloped over the past decade or so, and maturing in recent years, low-precision computing is quickly becoming an industry standard. As its utility and prominence grow, hardware needs to be co-designed to work in tandem with this approach. It\u2019s no coincidence, then, that low-precision computing is a crucial element of the architecture in IBM\u2019s family of AIUs, devices designed from the ground up to train and deploy AI models as efficiently as possible. Typical CPUs work in high precision, usually FP32 or FP64 floating point arithmetic. FP32 or FP64 means numbers are represented to 32 or 64 bits. This high level of precision is perfect for mathematics, medicine, or engineering, calculations that require exacting tolerances.\n\nFor AI, though, this level of precision is often overkill. Not only that, but since AI involves massive amounts of computations with a high level of redundancy, the compute requirements for running large language models at FP32 or FP64 precision are monumental. These numbers can be quantized, or pared down to a limited bitwidth, without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nMuch like a back-of-the-envelope calculation is sufficient for calculating the tip at a restaurant, or a quick glance is all it takes for us to tell a rose apart from a daisy, 16-, 8-, or even 4-bit precision can provide the appropriate level of computational accuracy for today\u2019s AI models. In fact, 16- and 8-bit compute are already industry accepted standards and are deployed in production settings. At the same time, researchers must develop algorithms to control the effect of reduced precision, so errors don\u2019t add up and derail model accuracy.\n\nAs the state of the industry moves toward low-precision computing, scientists at IBM Research have been advancing techniques for low-precision training, and are currently working on incorporating them into how we train and inference with LLMs, as well as how we design hardware for them.\n\nWhat is full-precision computing?\n\nFull-precision (or double-precision) computing usually refers to operations performed with 64-bit representations, says Mudhakar Srivatsa, a distinguished engineer at IBM Research and an expert on AI optimization. As you increase the number of bits, you increase both precision (decreasing the gap between two representable numbers) and range (increasing the minimum and maximum value of representable numbers). Computers can handle operations involving large, high-precision figures. Ask a modern computer to perform a single piece of arithmetic at 64 bits of precision, and the result will be near-instantaneous.\n\nBut when it comes to AI training and inference, which involve trillions of operations, the computational requirements and latency of full-precision computing add up quickly. For example, given an input of length 1,000, generating 1,000 output tokens on a LLaMa3 8b model would require over 20 trillion operations. This number grows with the number of concurrent requests and the context length (size of inputs and outputs), with many emerging workloads such as agentic systems driving the need for 128,000-token or even 1 million-token context lengths. \u201cTo multiply two n-digit numbers, you are performing n2 amount of work,\u201d Srivatsa says.\n\nModel weights for full-precision computing are also larger than low-precision weights, meaning each one takes up more memory space to store. Further, these weights (which can be tens to hundreds of gigabytes) must be moved from memory to the compute cores for every token generation. More bits of precision take quadratically more energy and silicon surface area \u2014 moving from 32 to 64 bits requires four times larger computational building blocks, while every step-down decreases energy and silicon requirements by four times. AI researchers are looking to low-precision computing to save on these operations.\n\nThe levels that typically qualify as low-precision are 8-, 4-, and 2-bit, says Srivatsa. There are two main angles that low-precision quantization has taken, says IBM Research distinguished engineer Raghu Ganti: One is reducing AI model weights to 4 bits while keeping activation functions at 16 bits, and the other, referred to as FP8, reduces both model weights and activation functions to 8 bits.\n\nLow precision, high performance\n\nThe redundancy of LLMs\u2019 computations create a lot of noise tolerance, making low precision suitable for them. The final output of any given operation, and the actions taken based on that output, are often the same whether you compute in full or reduced precision, says IBM Research scientist Viji Srinivasan, an expert on the hardware involved in low-precision computing. \u201cYou can go from FP64 or FP32 down to FP16, and if I do my computations using that precision, that bitwidth for representing a number, I will lose both precision and range,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if my resulting actions are the same as if I computed in higher precision, then I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nTo put a finer point on it, if the operation a*b is computed in 64, 32, or 16 bits, the values may have minor differences and could be considered errors. The higher bit representations will be more precise and have a more representable range for whatever values a and b are. In that sense, low-precision computing does not lead to an identical result.\n\nSrivatsa provides the following example of how changing precision can change your results:\n\n1.0 + ( 2 \u2212 16 ) \u2013 1.0 = 0 1.0 + (2^-16) \u2013 1.0 = 0 1.0 + ( 2 \u2212 16 ) \u20131.0 = 0 in 16-bit precision, but = 2 \u2212 16 = 2^-16 = 2 \u2212 16 in 32- or 64-bit\n\nHowever, 1.0 \u2013 1.0 + ( 2 \u2212 16 ) = 2 \u2212 16 1.0 \u2013 1.0 + (2^-16) = 2^-16 1.0\u20131.0 + ( 2 \u2212 16 ) = 2 \u2212 16 in 16-, 32-, and 64-bit precision\n\nThe way it should work is ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) ( a + b ) + c = a + ( b + c ) , a mathematical property known as associativity. At any finite-precision representation of floating-point numbers, this property is not guaranteed. It is just more obvious and perceivable at lower precisions.\n\nFortunately, with AI, you aren\u2019t counting on just one neuron to get it right, Srivatsa explains. \u201cYou have thousands of neurons, and if one makes a mistake, many other neurons will capture the signal.\u201d There\u2019s redundancy in the system, to the point that if some are incorrect or partially incorrect, low-precision computing still gives an overall correct answer. \u201cIt\u2019s like a majority vote: As long as 70%, 80% of them are doing a good job, I\u2019m good,\u201d Srivatsa says.\n\nPlus, the exact product of an operation isn\u2019t what we\u2019re after anyway \u2014 what we\u2019re after is the reaction based on that output, Srinivasan explains. \u201cIf the reaction remains the same whether I do this operation in high or low precision, then I\u2019m better off doing it in low precision,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen Srinivasan says \u201cbetter off,\u201d she\u2019s talking about the processor requirements. Reducing the amount of computation required for a given task, you can pack in more multipliers \u2014 or model weights \u2014 into the same area. In turn, that reduced footprint means low-precision hardware requires less energy per operation and can perform more operations per CPU cycle.\n\nTraining in low precision\n\nAnd the results speak for themselves. Training in FP8 can speed up the process by as much as 50% without sacrificing quality, Ganti says. \u201cI think we should start seeing evidence of training moving to FP8 by the end of this year across the industry,\u201d he predicts. \u201cAnd full-blown adoption will probably come by the end of the first half of 2025.\u201d\n\nFor floating-point numbers, reducing precision to 16 or 8 bits introduces errors. No matter what, shrinking bitwidth makes it impossible to represent finer precision and larger range. But there are mechanisms in AI applications used during both model training and inference to compensate for that quantization loss.\n\nOne of these options is mixed-precision operations, wherein floating-point multiplication is performed at lower precision (which accounts for over 90% of operations during training or inferencing), while accumulation (required for matrix multiplication) is performed at a higher precision. This is usually combined with pre or post scaling of the operands going into matrix multiplication to obtain better output accuracy. A second option is quantization-aware training, which compensates for the precision lost during quantization. This method, performed during pre-training or fine-tuning, teaches a model the compensation factor it will need to use when scaling for low precision, with both the model weights and the non-linear functions known as activation functions. Because it\u2019s done during training, this prepares the model to correct the outputs being produced during inference.\n\nInferencing in low precision\n\nInferencing using AI models is a game of watts and dollars per million tokens, says Srivatsa. \u201cSo if we can shrink the silicon footprint of a given operation from 4mm square to 1mm square, and if we can make that chip draw just one quarter of the power, that\u2019s a huge win.\u201d Low-precision computing is also enabling developers to deploy some LLMs right on laptops and consumer-grade GPUs, Ganti says, because they require fewer compute resources.\n\nAnd while most discussion of low-precision AI computing centers around model weights and activation values, a model\u2019s key-value or KV cache can benefit from reduced precision, too. The KV cache stores the tokens an LLM has already generated, and this can quickly grow to require even more memory than the model itself \u2013 in many production-grade inference servers the KV-cache may even be 8x the model size. And since sequence lengths are getting longer all the time, especially with AI agents which produce and critique their own outputs, storing KV caches in low precision has the potential to seriously shrink the memory footprint of LLMs, Srivatsa says. \u201cThis is a high-priority problem that needs to be solved,\u201d he notes.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve talked mostly about floating point numbers, but low-precision AI computing also involves fixed-point representations, or integers. And in some cases, low-precision computing can also mean converting floating-point values to fixed-point values \u2014 from FP16 or FP32 to INT8, for example. Whether using fixed- or floating-point representations, low-precision inferencing can still be run on AI models trained in full precision, Srivatsa says.\n\nOne potential shortcoming of low-precision inference, Srinivasan notes, is in cases where you\u2019re running a model with certain computations that are so sensitive to precision that reducing bitwidth can alter the actionable result. \u201cYou would be in a bind,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there are ways to cure it.\u201d Returning to training or fine-tuning will let you adjust model weights to account for this.\n\nBuilding for low precision\n\nLow-precision computing is changing not just how we use processors, but also how we build them. IBM Research is working on designing low-precision hardware built from the ground up with AI in mind. Low-precision computing can work on existing processors, Srinivasan explains, but it doesn\u2019t have as much advantage. \u201cIf you want to get all the benefits of area reduction and energy reduction, then you want to build hardware capable of doing lower precision arithmetic.\u201d If the hardware is built for higher precision, running it in low precision is still engaging high-precision multipliers, so it isn\u2019t going to offer the benefits of packing more compute into the same footprint or drawing less energy. \u201cThe area and power cost will be incurred even if the computations did not require higher precision,\u201d says Srinivasan.\n\nSrinivasan and other IBM Research scientists have been working on hardware that natively supports low-precision computing in the AIU family, including NorthPole, Spyre, and the analog chip prototypes. The Spyre accelerator, for example, supports multiplication and accumulation operations in FP16, FP8, INT8, and INT4, helping it achieve higher compute densities than other hardware typically used for model training \u2014 more horsepower with the same footprint.\n\nBeyond low precision\n\nWhile low precision is an important part of IBM\u2019s AI computing strategy, it is only one piece of the picture, Srinivasan points out. The AIU family of hardware also benefits from advancements like on-chip memory which eliminates the classical von Neumann bottleneck between memory and computing that tends to bog down AI training and inference. Flexibility, too, is a crucial component of these devices, which can run models in multiple different precisions depending on the specifics of their training. It\u2019s also possible to build full-precision capabilities into chips alongside low-precision, so that if a model isn\u2019t resilient to approximation, it can still be run on the same hardware. Researchers are working on various blends of precision that will make sense for different applications in the future.",

According to the companies, the integration is straightforward and doesn\u2019t require major system updates or complicated installations.\n\nWalmart, which refreshed its branding in 2025, is No. 2 in the Top 1000. The Top 1000 is Digital Commerce 360\u2019s database of the region\u2019s largest online retailers, ranked by their annual web sales. It is also No. 9 in the Global Online Marketplaces Database, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\nHow IBM\u2019s Walmart GoLocal integration works\n\nFor IBM clients, adopting Walmart\u2019s delivery solutions is simple: When an order is ready to ship, retailers can select Walmart GoLocal as their delivery provider.\n\nGoLocal uses Walmart\u2019s logistics network to dispatch drivers for last-mile deliveries across the U.S., offering a range of options like same-day, next-day, scheduled and even big-and-bulky shipping. The service is designed to be flexible and customizable, providing a white-label solution for businesses big or small, Walmart said.\n\nThe new partnership expands Walmart GoLocal\u2019s reach, connecting with retailers already using IBM\u2019s Sterling Order Management platform. These include major retailers like Sally Beauty, World Market, and John Lewis Partnerships, according to IBM.\n\nIBM for order management services\n\nIn North America, 18 online retailers in the Top 1000 use IBM for order management services. Collectively, the 18 retailers generated more than $89.54 billion in web sales in 2023.\n\nIn an email to Digital Commerce 360, IBM highlighted key features of its order management system (OMS) platform, including its ability to deploy ship-from-store capabilities in just three weeks and deliver a 170% return on investment within three years by cutting costs.\n\nIn a recent blog post, IBM also shared how the Sterling platform handled last year\u2019s peak holiday shopping surge. Between Nov. 27 and Dec. 3, Sterling OMS processed over 42 million order lines, handled 6 billion API calls, and reached speeds of 180 orders per second, according to the company.\n\nWhy last-mile delivery matters\n\nLast-mile delivery \u2014 the final step in getting orders to customers \u2014 is often the most challenging and expensive part of the supply chain. Rising consumer expectations for speed, driven by services like Amazon Prime, have added pressure on retailers to improve delivery options.\n\nAccording to a 2024 Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights survey of 1,013 online shoppers, delivery speed ranked second only to free shipping as the most important factor when choosing where to shop. The survey showed that more than a quarter of respondents cited next-day delivery as one of the most important factors in retailer selection, while 24% chose same-day shipping.\n\nSince its launch in 2021, Walmart GoLocal has worked to meet these demands, partnering with well-known brands like Hibbett, UrbanStems, Sur La Table and Books-A-Million. The service has positioned Walmart as a competitive alternative to FedEx and UPS in the growing last-mile delivery market.\n\nTaking convenience to the next level\n\nNotably, the IBM-Walmart collaboration was featured at this month\u2019s National Retail Federation 2025 conference in New York City, where the companies hosted a fireside chat. The discussion featured Chris Townsend, IBM\u2019s global managing director for Walmart, and Rina Hurst, vice president of Walmart GoLocal.\n\n\u201cBy integrating Walmart GoLocal into IBM Sterling, we\u2019re taking convenience to the next level,\u201d Hurst said in the announcement. \u201cIBM customers can now tap into Walmart GoLocal\u2019s extensive last-mile delivery network and robust suite of delivery capabilities, empowering them to enhance efficiency and grow their business.\u201d\n\nTownsend echoed her enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see IBM\u2019s expertise in order management and interoperability paired with Walmart GoLocal\u2019s experience and scale, driving innovation and success in inventory optimization and last-mile delivery,\u201d he stated.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

IBM retail customers who sign up with Walmart GoLocal can now integrate Walmart GoLocal\u2019s suite of last-mile delivery solutions into their operations, the release added.\n\n\u201cLast-mile is often considered the most difficult and costly step in the supply chain, and can be further complicated by rising consumer expectations around shortened delivery timeframes,\u201d the companies said. \u201cWalmart GoLocal offers a full range of last-mile solutions to any retailer looking to improve their last-mile delivery and better serve their customers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, the collaboration is designed to simplify the operational workflow for IBM clients hoping to work with Walmart GoLocal for their deliveries.\n\nOnce an order is placed and ready to ship, IBM\u2019s order management system lets users pick a delivery service provider from a list that now includes Walmart GoLocal offerings such as same-day, next-day, multi-day, scheduled, big and bulky and batched deliveries.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the integration is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable, mitigating the need for extensive development or complex modifications,\u201d the release added.\n\nIn other Walmart news, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote earlier this month about the retail giant\u2019s banking efforts via its One offering.\n\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s hope with One is that it will do what Walmart has been unable to do effectively until now,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is to turn its customer base into a mobile ecosystem. It\u2019s a big market. There are 100 million people who walk through its doors every week, roughly 38% of the adult consumer population.\u201d\n\nWebster added that the potential pool of customers is around 20% more than the entire customer base of J.P. Morgan and nearly double its active mobile banking population (53 million). It\u2019s also 15 times greater than what Chime has listed as its active user profile.\n\nAlso this month, PYMNTS explored Walmart\u2019s healthcare efforts in a conversation with Arias Websterberry, CEO of WebsterBerry Marketing, who said this focus is \u201cabsolutely a game-changer\u201d for community health access.\n\n\u201cBy hosting events like Walmart Wellness Day, they\u2019re leveraging their unparalleled retail footprint that allows them to deliver essential health services to the masses,\u201d said Westerberry. \u201cThis approach not only is going to drive an enormous amount of foot traffic, but it also positions Walmart as a trusted partner in the preventative and primary care market. It\u2019s a strategic move, and this evolution is going to reflect the growing kind of convergence of retail and healthcare.\u201d",

            "content": "Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in International Business Machines. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.8% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 6.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nWe can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nEvery investor in International Business Machines Corporation ( NYSE:IBM ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 62% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of International Business Machines\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of International Business Machines Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$197m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

            "content": "With 10,000 of SAP\u2019s 20,000+ on-prem customers running on IBM Power systems, SAP and IBM have developed a custom configuration of RISE with SAP that enables those Power on-prem customers to migrate to the cloud in as little as 90 days while remaining on the Power platform.\n\nThose moves to the cloud have become extremely urgent issues for all of those 20,000+ on-prem customers because SAP will soon drop support for its legacy ERP systems. For ECC and R3, that deadline is the end of 2027, while customers running older versions of those systems could have support for their mission-critical ERP systems cease this year or in 2026.\n\nIn a conversation late last week, IBM Power General Manager Tom McPherson said the new Power-specific version of RISE offers those 10,000 on-prem SAP-on-Power customers tangible advantages in speed of migration, overall cost, and what McPherson described as \u201cinvestment protection.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a sticking point for some customers that can see, at least on paper, the theoretical advantages of moving to the cloud with SAP\u2019s S/4HANA, but are concerned that the related expenses will be prohibitive.\n\nThe new IBM-SAP program helps mitigate those concerns, McPherson said, with \u201cbuy-back\u201d plans for customers\u2019 legacy Power systems, as well as with financial incentives for systems integrators managing the migrations for customers.\n\nSecurity considerations are also paramount in the minds of customers, McPherson said, and the RISE for Power program addresses that by replicating the high-security capabilities of on-prem Power while also being optimized for enterprise AI via a range of IBM technologies.\n\nI thought it was interesting to see how the IBM press release about the new partnership referred to IBM as a \u201chyperscaler,\u201d a designation that IBM has largely eschewed over the past few years.\n\nMcPherson said that term applies in this limited context because the required hyperscaler code stack for S/4HANA runs within the IBM Cloud.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nThe press release from the two iconic enterprise-tech companies says that RISE with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server is \u201cthe fastest and easiest path for IBM Power customers to accelerate their ERP transformation, and delivers \u201cfaster, less disruptive transitions to the cloud.\u201d\n\nFor IBM itself, those outcomes are far from theoretical: When IBM migrated its SAP ERP from Power on-prem to the Power Virtual Server, the company realized a 30% reduction in infrastructure costs and related operations. From the press release:\n\n\u201cIn one of the largest and most complex SAP S/4HANA Cloud modernization projects of any SAP customer to date, according to SAP, IBM recently moved its quote-to-cash and record-to-report processes to RISE with SAP on IBM Power Virtual Server.\n\n\u201cThe IBM project touched more than 150,000 users across 175 countries in 18 months. During this time, it resulted in a 30 percent reduction in infrastructure costs and related operations by rationalizing overall server and data footprint and increasing process automation.\u201d\n\nFor SAP, a $10 Billion Opportunity?\n\nWhile the cost of ERP migrations can vary broadly, a market projection posted by SAP about 16 months ago put the average SAP revenue for every migration at about $1,000,000.\n\nIn an analysis I did in Oct. 23 headlined \u201cSAP Eyes $27.5 Billion Opportunity with Expanded RISE Program,\u201d I posted a slide from SAP in which it estimates that the move of its 25,000 on-prem customers (the number it had at that time) could generate revenue for SAP of 25 billion euros, which translates to about $27.5 billion.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

Recently, IBM Research worked with the IBM infrastructure team to harden this prototype and create an enterprise-grade version called the IBM Spyre Accelerator, which will power the next generation of IBM Z and IBM Power systems.\n\nBut none of that would\u2019ve been possible if those AIU chips hadn\u2019t first made a stop at Lancaster\u2019s lab.

IBM stock is now down 10% from its 52-week high of $239.35 and is trading in negative territory to start the year. This decline highlights ongoing challenges within IBM\u2019s consulting segment.\n\nThe consulting business has encountered headwinds stemming from factors like geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and rising interest rates. These conditions have led businesses to cut back on discretionary IT spending. As a result, consulting revenues slightly declined during the third quarter of 2024, coming in at the lower end of management\u2019s expectations.\n\nHeadwinds Persist for IBM\n\nIBM is currently navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment, with no immediate signs of improvement in client spending behavior. As businesses adjust their IT budgets to focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, IBM\u2019s consulting revenue could remain under pressure. Management has indicated that this trend will likely continue into the fourth quarter, with consulting performance expected to stay in line with Q3.\n\nAdding to the challenges, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could create headwinds for the company. Further, the uncertainty around the PC refresh cycle in 2025 is a concern.\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead for IBM in 2025?\n\nWhile the company\u2019s consulting arm is facing challenges, IBM is repositioning its portfolio toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses such as hybrid cloud and AI. This pivot aligns with growing client demand for advanced technologies that enhance business operations.\n\nFurther, the consulting segment\u2019s improved portfolio mix, operating leverage, and productivity initiatives are likely to generate solid margins and free cash flow.\n\nIBM will likely benefit from the acceleration in software revenue. The software segment could see broad-based growth, with key areas such as hybrid cloud, data management, automation, and transaction processing poised to deliver strong results.\n\nIn terms of near-term growth, IBM\u2019s revenue under contract has shown impressive momentum, growing in the mid-teens, while annual bookings rose at a double-digit pace in the third quarter. Further, opportunities from generative AI and traction in its virtualization solutions augur well for growth.\n\nIn the software business, IBM witnessed solid growth in its recurring revenue base. Further, the momentum will likely sustain led by innovation across its software portfolio. The company\u2019s hybrid platform and solutions annual recurring revenue (ARR) has reached $14.9 billion in Q3, an 11% increase year-over-year, fueled by advancements in AI, automation, data services, and Red Hat\u2019s growing contributions. Further, the transaction processing division saw 9% growth in Q3, reflecting its growing capacity, launch of a new generative AI product, and high renewal rates.\n\nThe company continues to launch new products, which will support its growth in 2025. Further, its HashiCorp acquisition will drive significant synergies for IBM. This acquisition will allow it to offer more comprehensive hybrid and multi-cloud solutions to enterprise clients, effectively expanding its addressable market and strengthening its competitive positioning.\n\nThe Bottom Line on IBM Stock\n\nWhile IBM\u2019s consulting segment may continue to face challenges in the short term, the company\u2019s ongoing focus on margin improvement offers an optimistic outlook for the long term. Despite the relatively weak demand environment, IBM appears well-positioned to capitalize on the generative AI market.\n\nLooking forward, generative AI also presents a promising avenue for growth for its consulting arm. IBM is building a portfolio of AI-driven solutions, with $1 billion in new bookings for its AI-related products reported in Q3. The company\u2019s collaborations with clients to develop custom AI architectures further strengthen its position in the AI space.\n\nFurther, IBM\u2019s software business momentum is expected to sustain, with revenue growth anticipated to remain strong. This steady growth could be a key driver for the company\u2019s financial performance moving forward.\n\nHowever, Wall Street analysts maintain a \u201cHold\u201d consensus rating on IBM stock. This cautious stance stems from the lingering weakness in its consulting business. Additionally, given the stock\u2019s impressive performance over the past year, with shares up nearly 31% over the past 52 weeks, analysts\u2019 average price target reflects limited upside potential in the near term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nIBM Quantum dilution refrigerator. Credit: IBM.\n\nThe operation and performance of quantum computers relies on the ability to realize and control entanglement between multiple qubits. Yet entanglement between many qubits is inherently susceptible to noise and imperfections in quantum gates.\n\nIn recent years, quantum physicists and engineers worldwide have thus been trying to develop more robust protocols to realize and control entanglement. To be most effective for real-world applications, these approaches should reliably support long-range entanglement, or in other words ensure that qubits remain entangled even when they are separated by large distances.\n\nResearchers at IBM Quantum, University of Cologne and Harvard University set out to demonstrate one of these protocols in an experimental setting.\n\nTheir paper, published in Nature Physics, demonstrates the generation of long-range entanglement and a mixed state phase transition in a system comprised of 54 qubits on the ibm_sherbrooke quantum computer, which is powered by a 127-qubit IBM Eagle quantum processor.\n\n\"In 2022, teams at the University of Cologne's Institute for Theoretical Physics and Harvard's Department of Physics posted an arXiv pre-print in which they proposed a theoretical protocol to produce a widely studied long-range entangled state,\" Edward H. Chen, co-first author of the paper and researcher at IBM Quantum, told Phys.org.\n\n\"This paper caught the attention of our team at IBM. The protocol it introduced was not only relevant for the broad condensed matter community, but it also had relevance to the long-term interest of performing quantum error correction.\"\n\nThe recent study by Chen and his colleagues builds on the previous theoretical work of researchers at University of Cologne and Harvard, who introduced a new protocol to realize a long-range entangled state, known as the Ising order in a system with multiple qubits.\n\nAs IBM Quantum has an active collaboration with Harvard, they reached out to the university and initiated a collaboration with some of the researchers who introduced the protocol.\n\n\"The protocol entails the use of very few layers of quantum gates to create a minimal amount of entanglement between two sets of qubits and then measure out one set of them so as to consolidate the other set, leveraging the backaction of quantum measurements,\" explained Gui-Yi Zhu, co-first author of the paper.\n\nThe IBM Quantum Eagle process. Credit: Carl De Torres of StoryTK for IBM.\n\n\"Another indispensable ingredient is the communication between the measured classical bits and the unmeasured qubits, akin to the idea of quantum teleportation, which was essentially the game that Ed and I were playing.\"\n\nIn their experiments, Chen, Zhu and their colleagues used classical decoding to extract and stabilize the quantum order in their 54-qubit system that was masked by noise. They found that this order persisted despite the errors in the system, up until the system entered a so-called Nishimori transition.\n\nThis critical phase transition was rare and classical systems require fine-tuning to reach this state. In contrast, the researchers found that this state emerged naturally in their quantum system, due to a rule that governs quantum measurement, known as Born's rule. Moreover, this phenomenon, which is rare in classical systems, was recently found to be ubiquitous in the open quantum systems, such as quantum error correction and topological phase of matter.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

In the future, the protocol and methods used by Chen, Zhu and their colleagues could contribute to the scaling of quantum processors, while also informing research assessing the performance of large quantum computers in noisy environments.\n\n\"As authorities at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter physics, Guo-Yi Zhu and Simon Trebst extended the insights from this work to consider the impact of sequential rounds of the protocol in different bases and the possibility of simulating spin liquids,\" added Chen.\n\n\"Ruben Verresen, along with Nathanan Tantivasadakarn and Ashvin Vishwanath, had the foresight years ago to study the impact of measurements and feed-forward in general for strongly interacting systems, and are also pioneers in this area. We are currently considering ways to mitigate the leading errors so that we could, in fact, perform multiple rounds of the protocol on our latest devices.\"\n\nChen and his colleagues at IBM Quantum are now working on improving the protocol they employed, while also developing new hardware that will be released over the next few years. By 2029, they expect to realize a highly performing quantum system that is capable of error correction.\n\nMore information: Edward H.

But it has been beset by years of delays and costs running into billions of pounds.\n\nIt is set to support more than 300,000 emergency responders in Britain, and will allow police, fire and ambulance services to share live data and imagery, location reports and essential public safety information as they work on rescue and response incidents.\n\nAs part of the network, new software for handheld devices will provide data-sharing functions and real-time video features, as well as a push-to-talk feature for instant communications.\n\nThe Home Office said the system will help provide vital information to emergency services more quickly, for example instantly updating fire services about the make and model of a vehicle involved in a road traffic accident, which could then be cross-referenced with data on how to best use cutting equipment if someone is trapped, or where batteries are located on an electric car.\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson said: \u201cEvery day our brave emergency services help members of the public facing life or death situations. We must do everything we can to maximise the chances of successful outcomes, and communications between frontline staff is critical to ensuring this.\n\n\u201cThis Government is working tirelessly to support this project, making sure it is delivered in a timely and cost-effective manner, and IBM will be an important part of bringing the Emergency Services Network online.\u201d\n\nRahul Kalia, managing partner at IBM UK and Ireland, said: \u201cWe are proud to support the Emergency Services Network in delivering a secure and resilient communications platform to empower frontline emergency services.\n\n\u201cWorking with our ecosystem partners, we will deliver mission-critical services for first responders to enhance safety in our communities across Great Britain.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the Government to deliver this in a timely and cost-effective manner.\u201d\n\nIn 2023 MPs warned that Britain\u2019s blue light services were facing \u201csignificant costs\u201d because of Home Office failures with the plan and said the former Conservative government had already spent more than \u00a32 billion on the project.",

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.86%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.38%.\n\nThe technology and consulting company's stock has dropped by 4.8% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 1.29% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.2%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of IBM in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on January 29, 2025. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.74, down 3.36% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $17.6 billion, indicating a 1.25% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for IBM. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

            "content": "In 1981, American physicist and Nobel Laureate, Richard Feynman, gave a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) near Boston, in which he outlined a revolutionary idea. Feynman suggested that the strange physics of quantum mechanics could be used to perform calculations.\n\nThe field of quantum computing was born. In the 40-plus years since, it has become an intensive area of research in computer science. Despite years of frantic development, physicists have not yet built practical quantum computers that are well suited for everyday use and normal conditions (for example, many quantum computers operate at very low temperatures). Questions and uncertainties still remain about the best ways to reach this milestone.\n\nWhat exactly is quantum computing, and how close are we to seeing them enter wide use? Let\u2019s first look at classical computing, the type of computing we rely on today, like the laptop I am using to write this piece.\n\nClassical computers process information using combinations of \u201cbits\u201d, their smallest units of data. These bits have values of either 0 or 1. Everything you do on your computer, from writing emails to browsing the web, is made possible by processing combinations of these bits in strings of zeroes and ones.\n\nQuantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits. Unlike classical bits, qubits don\u2019t just represent 0 or 1. Thanks to a property called quantum superposition, qubits can be in multiple states simultaneously. This means a qubit can be 0, 1, or both at the same time. This is what gives quantum computers the ability to process massive amounts of data and information simultaneously.\n\nImagine being able to explore every possible solution to a problem all at once, instead of once at a time. It would allow you to navigate your way through a maze by simultaneously trying all possible paths at the same time to find the right one. Quantum computers are therefore incredibly fast at finding optimal solutions, such as identifying the shortest path, the quickest way.\n\nThink about the extremely complex problem of rescheduling airline flights after a delay or an unexpected incident. This happens with regularity in the real world, but the solutions applied may not be the best or optimal ones. In order to work out the optimal responses, standard computers would need to consider, one by one, all possible combinations of moving, rerouting, delaying, cancelling or grouping, flights.\n\nEvery day there are more than 45,000 flights, organised by over 500 airlines, connecting more than 4,000 airports. This problem would take years to solve for a classical computer.\n\nOn the other hand, a quantum computer would be able to try all these possibilities at once and let the best configuration organically emerge. Qubits also have a physical property known as entanglement. When qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are.\n\nThis is something that, again, has no counterpart in classical computing. Entanglement allows quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than traditional computers can.\n\nRead more: Brain implants, agentic AI and answers on dark matter: what to expect from science in 2025 \u2013 podcast\n\nA common question is whether quantum computers will completely replace classical computers or not. The short answer is no, at least not in the foreseeable future. Quantum computers are incredibly powerful for solving specific problems \u2013 such as simulating the interactions between different molecules, finding the best solution from many options or dealing with encryption and decryption. However, they are not suited to every type of task.\n\nClassical computers process one calculation at a time in a linear sequence, and they follow algorithms (sets of mathematical rules for carrying out particular computing tasks) designed for use with classical bits that are either 0 or 1. This makes them extremely predictable, robust and less prone to errors than quantum machines. For everyday computing needs such as word processing or browsing the internet, classical computers will continue to play a dominant role.\n\nThere are at least two reasons for that. The first one is practical. Building a quantum computer that can run reliable calculations is extremely difficult. The quantum world is incredibly volatile, and qubits are easily disturbed by things in their environment, such as interference from electromagnetic radiation, which makes them prone to errors.\n\nThe second reason lies in the inherent uncertainty in dealing with qubits. Because qubits are in superposition (are neither a 0 or 1) they are not as predictable as the bits used in classical computing. Physicists therefore describe qubits and their calculations in terms of probabilities. This means that the same problem, using the same quantum algorithm, run multiple times on the same quantum computer might return a different solution each time.\n\nTo address this uncertainty, quantum algorithms are typically run multiple times. The results are then analysed statistically to determine the most likely solution. This approach allows researchers to extract meaningful information from the inherently probabilistic quantum computations.\n\nFrom a commercial point of view, the development of quantum computing is still in its early stages, but the landscape is very diverse with lots of new companies appearing every year. It is fascinating to see that in addition to big, established companies like IBM and Google, new ones are joining, such as IQM, Pasqal and startups such as Alice and Bob. They are all working on making quantum computers more reliable, scalable and accessible.\n\nIn the past, manufacturers have drawn attention to the number of qubits in their quantum computers, as a measure of how powerful the machine is. Manufacturers are increasingly prioritising ways to correct the errors that quantum computers are prone to. This shift is crucial for developing large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers, as these techniques are essential for improving their usability.\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest quantum chip, Willow, recently demonstrated remarkable progress in this area. The more qubits Google used in Willow, the more it reduced the errors. This achievement marks a significant step towards building commercially relevant quantum computers that can revolutionise fields like medicine, energy and AI.\n\nAfter more than 40 years, quantum computing is still in its infancy, but significant progress is expected in the next decade. The probabilistic nature of these machines represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical computing. It is what makes them fragile and hard to develop and scale.\n\nAt the same time, it is what makes them a very powerful tool to solve optimisation problems, exploring multiple solutions at the same time, faster and more efficiently that classical computers can.",

            "content": "IBM, AT&T, and HP are all cheaply valued, but they all pay hefty dividends.\n\nMany tech stocks surged over the past year as expectations for lower interest rates drove investors back toward higher-growth companies. But with the Nasdaq Composite now hovering near its all-time highs, investors should get picky with the stocks they buy.\n\nSo instead of chasing the highest-growth tech stocks, it might be prudent to check out the cheaper ones that pay higher dividends. These stalwarts should hold up well during a market downturn, and their dividends will become more appealing as interest rates decline. These three undervalued tech stocks still look like great buys in January: IBM (IBM 0.17%), AT&T (T 0.67%), and HP (HPQ 0.90%).\n\n1. IBM\n\nFor many years, IBM was a dusty old tech company with declining revenue and profits. Its core IT software and services business was shriveling, it struggled to keep pace with its nimbler cloud-based competitors, and it was more focused on divestment, cost-cutting measures, and desperate buybacks than finding fresh ways to grow again.\n\nThat all changed under Arvind Krishna, who took the helm as IBM's CEO in 2020. Under Krishna, IBM spun off its slow-growth managed IT infrastructure services business as Kyndryl and expanded its open-source subsidiary Red Hat's presence in the hybrid cloud and AI markets.\n\nThose strategies paid off. From 2021 to 2023, IBM's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4%, as its earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 13%. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 3% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThose growth rates might not seem too impressive, but they represent a huge improvement from its declining sales and profits in previous years. IBM still looks cheap relative to many other tech stocks at 21 times forward earnings. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 3%, which could become even more attractive as fixed-income yields decline.\n\n2. AT&T\n\nAT&T was once considered a dying telecom company that had \"di-worsified\" its business with pricey media acquisitions. But in 2021 and 2022, it spun off DirecTV, Time Warner, and many of its smaller media assets to streamline its business.\n\nBy abandoning its quest to become the next Netflix, AT&T freed up more cash to expand its core 5G and fiber businesses. It also ensured that it had enough cash to cover its dividends, which currently sport a forward yield of 5%, and reduce its debt.\n\nIn 2023, AT&T generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow (FCF) as the net adds for its postpaid phone and fiber businesses grew by 1.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively. For 2024, it expects its annual FCF to grow to between $17 billion and $18 billion.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect AT&T's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 1% and 5%, respectively. Those growth rates seem sluggish, but its high yield and low valuation should make it a great safe haven play in this unpredictable market.\n\n3. HP\n\nHP, one of the world's leading producers of PCs and printers, suffered a major slowdown from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 (which ended last October). Its sales slowed down after it lapped the pandemic-driven buying frenzy in consumer PCs and printers, and the macro headwinds throttled its sales of commercial products.\n\nThat pressure drove HP to cut costs and buy back more shares, but its EPS still dropped 14% in fiscal 2023. That decline was disappointing, but HP's business will likely recover as the PC market stabilizes and warms up again.\n\nFor now, it's focused on pruning its workforce, streamlining its PC portfolio with fewer models, launching more subscription services, and rolling out fresh products for higher-growth hybrid work, gaming, industrial graphics, and 3D printing markets.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to 2027, analysts expect HP's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 2% and 9%, respectively, as those turnaround efforts kick in. Its stock looks cheap at just 10 times this year's earnings, and it pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 2.8%. It won't skyrocket anytime soon, but it could still be a great value stock for patient investors.",

While Hedera\u2019s partnership with credible entities suggests stability, potential investors should weigh in the broader market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and competitive challenges from other blockchain technologies.

Concerns around centralization due to its governance model and the influence of established firms might deter some crypto purists. Critics argue the significance of decentralization, worried that the council\u2019s composition might concentrate decision-making power.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith its distinctive technology and influential stakeholders, Hedera Hashgraph could play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital transactions. While its adoption could redefine the cryptocurrency landscape by 2025, the inherent risks and market dynamics remain critical factors for potential investors to consider profoundly.\n\nAs the crypto community keeps a watchful eye on Hedera\u2019s journey, it will be fascinating to see how it navigates the challenges and harnesses opportunities to secure its place in the evolving digital economy.",

After all, why would a tech company that transformed itself into the most valuable firm ever by selling parts that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, suddenly decide to sell an entire system for a fraction of the price?\n\nI believe that Nvidia wants to revolutionize computing the way IBM did it almost 45 years ago with the original IBM PC.\n\nIt may be time to introduce Jensen\u2019s law to complement Moore\u2019s law: At equal AI performance, it takes about 100 months to cut the price per FLOP by 25. D. Athow\n\nProject DIGITS, as a reminder, is a fully formed, off-the-shelf super computer built into something the size of a mini PC. It is essentially a smaller version of the DGX-1, the first of its kind launched almost a decade ago, back in April 2016. Then, it sold for $129,000 with a 16-core Intel Xeon CPU and eight P100 GPGPU cards; Digits costs $3,000.\n\nNvidia confirmed it has an AI performance of 1,000 Teraflops at FP4 precision (dense/sparse?). Although there\u2019s no direct comparison, one can estimate that the diminutive super computer has roughly half the processing power of a fully loaded 8-card Pascal-based DGX-1.\n\nAt the heart of Digits is the GB10 SoC, which has 20 Arm Cores (10 Arm Cortex-X925 and 10 Cortex-A725). Other than the confirmed presence of a Blackwell GPU (a lite version of the B100), one can only infer the power consumption (100W) and the bandwidth (825GB/s according to The Register).\n\nYou should be able to connect two of these devices (but not more) via Nvidia\u2019s proprietary ConnectX technology to tackle larger LLMs such as Meta's Llama 3.1 405B. Shoving these tiny mini PCs in a 42U rack seems to be a near impossibility for now as it would encroach on Nvidia\u2019s far more lucrative DGX GB200 systems.\n\nAll about the moat\n\nWhy did Nvidia embark on Project DIGITS? I think it is all about reinforcing its moat. Making your products so sticky that it becomes near impossible to move to the competition is something that worked very well for others: Microsoft and Windows, Google and Gmail, Apple and the iPhone.\n\nThe same happened with Nvidia and CUDA - being in the driving seat allowed Nvidia to do things such as shuffling the goal posts and wrongfooting the competition.\n\nThe move to FP4 for inference allowed Nvidia to deliver impressive benchmark claims such as \u201cBlackwell delivers 2.5x its predecessor\u2019s performance in FP8 for training, per chip, and 5x with FP4 for inference\u201d. Of course, AMD doesn\u2019t offer FP4 computation in the MI300X/325X series and we will have to wait till later this year for it to roll out in the Instinct MI350X/355X.\n\nNvidia is therefore laying the ground for future incursions, for lack of a better word or analogy, from existing and future competitors, including its own customers (think Microsoft and Google). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s ambition is clear; he wants to expand the company\u2019s domination beyond the realm of the hyperscalers.\n\n\u201cAI will be mainstream in every application for every industry. With Project DIGITS, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers, placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,\u201d Huang recently commented.\n\nShort of renaming Nvidia as Nvid-ai, this is as close as it gets to Huang acknowledging his ambitions to make his company\u2019s name synonymous with AI, just like Tarmac and Hoover before them (albeit in more niche verticals).\n\n(Image credit: Storagereview.com)\n\nWhy Mediatek?\n\nI was also, like many, perplexed by the Mediatek link and the rationale for this tie-up can be found in the Mediatek press release. The Taiwanese company \u201cbrings its design expertise in Arm-based SoC performance and power efficiency to [a] groundbreaking device for AI researchers and developers\u201d it noted.\n\nThe partnership, I believe, benefits Mediatek more than Nvidia and in the short run, I can see Nvidia quietly going solo. Reuters reported Huang dismissed the idea of Nvidia going after AMD and Intel, saying, \u201cNow they [Mediatek] could provide that to us, and they could keep that for themselves and serve the market. And so it was a great win-win\u201d.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia will not deliver more mainstream products though, just they would be aimed at businesses and professionals, not consumers where cut throat competition makes things more challenging (and margins wafer thin).\n\nReuters article quotes Huang saying, \"We're going to make that a mainstream product, we'll support it with all the things that we do to support professional and high-quality software, and the PC (manufacturers) will make it available to end users.\"\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 DIGITS DIGITS 2.4X DGX-1 v1 Variance (DGX vs DIGITS) Depth (est.) in mm 89 89 866 9.73x Width (est.) in mm 135 324 444 1.37x Height (est.) in mm 40 40 131 3.28x Weight in Kg ~1 ~2.4 60.8 25.35x Price USD (Nov 2024 adjusted) 3000 7200 170100 23.63x Performance GPU FP16 (TF) 0 0 170 Row 5 - Cell 4 Performance GPU FP16 Dense (TF) ~282 676.8 680 1.00x Performance GPU FP4 Dense (TF) 1000 Row 7 - Cell 2 0 Row 7 - Cell 4 GPU memory (GB) 128 307.2 128 0.42x Max Power consumption (W) ~150 ~300 3200 10.67x Storage (TB) 4 9.6 7.68 0.80x GPU Family Blackwell Blackwell Pascal Row 11 - Cell 4 GPU power comsumption (W) x8 ~100 ~240 2400 10x GPU transistor count (bn) x8 ~30 ~72 120 1.67x Memory Bandwidth (GB/sec) x ~850 ~850 720 0.85x\n\nGazing in my crystal ball\n\nOne theory I came across while researching this feature is that more data scientists are embracing Apple\u2019s Mac platform because it offers a balanced approach. Good enough performance - thanks to its unified memory architecture - at a \u2018reasonable\u2019 price. The Mac Studio with 128GB unified memory and 4TB SSD currently retails for $5,799.\n\nSo where does Nvidia go from there? An obvious move would be to integrate the memory on the SoC, similar to what Apple has done with its M series SoC (and AMD with its HBM-fuelled Epyc). This would not only save on costs but would improve performance, something that its bigger sibling, the GB200 already does.\n\nThen it will depend on whether Nvidia wants to offer more at the same price or the same performance at a lower price point (or a bit of both). Nvidia could go Intel\u2019s way and use the GB10 as a prototype to encourage other key partners (PNY, Gigabyte, Asus) to launch similar projects (Intel did that with the Next Unit of Computing or NUC).\n\nI am also particularly interested to know what will happen to the Jetson Orin family; the NX 16GB version was upgraded just a few weeks ago to offer 157 TOPS in INT8 performance. This platform is destined to fulfill more DIY/edge use cases rather than pure training/inference tasks but I can\u2019t help but think about \u201cWhat If\u201d scenarios.\n\nNvidia is clearly disrupting itself before others attempt to do so; the question is how far will it go.",

The department says those affected will be contacted by the provincial government about getting credit protection.\n\nOn Thursday, Nova Scotia officials said the security breach, first reported Wednesday, also affected schools in Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.\n\nIn Ontario, district schools boards in Toronto, Peel and Durham issued notices about a \u201ccyber incident\u201d targeting PowerSchool.\n\nThe boards said the U.S.-based third-party vendor that offers the PowerSchool software had experienced a data breach between Dec. 22 and Dec. 28.\n\nPublished reports indicate the breach also affected other school boards in Ontario, as well as in Alberta, Manitoba and several U.S. states.\n\nThe California-based company has said the breach was contained. The company says its software is used by 18,000 customers in more than 80 countries, where about 60 million K-12 students are tracked.\n\n\u201cWe take our responsibility to protect student data privacy and act responsibly as data processors extremely seriously,\u201d the company said in its statement Wednesday.\n\nTypically, the system does not include medical information or financial data, such as credit card numbers.

            "content": "The village of Endicott has filed a lawsuit against IBM for allegedly contaminating its water supply with chemicals that could pose a danger to human health, reigniting concerns over IBM\u2019s history of chemical leaks as demolition of its Endicott campus begins.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that IBM\u2019s management of certain dangerous chemicals was \u201ccareless and negligent,\u201d leading to chemical contamination of soil and groundwater. It points to chemicals the company used in its manufacturing process, including 1,4-Dioxane and PFAS forever chemicals, which have been linked to several health concerns, like cancer.\n\nThose chemicals have been found in wells that Endicott relies on for its water, according to the lawsuit, potentially harming the health of local residents. The village has also had to pay for water treatment and quality monitoring because of the chemicals, the complaint states.\n\nThe village, which is home to over 13,000 people in Broome County, now relies on a single well, according to a statement from Endicott Mayor Nick Burlingame. The lawsuit aims to hold IBM responsible, he added.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Village of Endicott has been working to clean up damage to our water infrastructure left behind by IBM,\u201d said Burlingame. \u201cThis litigation seeks to ensure IBM takes responsibility for the resources and restorations to our water wells which are necessary to protect public health.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, IBM spokesperson Sarah Minkel said there is \u201cno justification\u201d for the village\u2019s demands and the company plans to fight the lawsuit.\n\n\"IBM's more than 40 years of remediation activities in Endicott, in partnership with the village and state, demonstrates our longstanding commitment to the health and safety of the residents of the community,\u201d said Minkel.\n\nA history of contamination\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to require IBM pay for past, present, and future costs of cleaning up the village\u2019s water supply. It is unclear how much those costs would be.\n\nIBM operated in Endicott for nearly a century before shuttering its final site in 2023. Demolition of its former campus began on Dec. 31 , but chemicals from its manufacturing process continue to lurk underground.\n\nIn 1979, the company reported a spill of 4,100 gallons of chemical solvents , which created an underground plume of trichloroethene and other chemicals that can cause health effects, including damage to the nervous system.\n\nAn investigation ordered by New York\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation in 2002 found that contaminated vapor from the plume had migrated from the groundwater, through the soil, and into the air in the buildings above.\n\nThe state designated the facility as a superfund site in 2004, stating that chemical contamination posed a significant threat to public health or the environment. The designation also required IBM to investigate the extent of harm and begin clean-up efforts, which continue today .\n\nThe company must respond to the village\u2019s legal complaint by March 6.\n\n",

            "content": "As Federal agencies look to modernize or transform their IT systems, a new report from the IBM Center for The Business of Government recommends that agencies leverage robotic process automation (RPA) and generative AI to help solve technology challenges that exist within government.\n\nThe 50-page report, titled Digital Modernization for Government: An Implementation Framework, offers many solutions to government agencies looking to modernize their systems. However, RPA and generative AI stand out as emerging tools that the report identifies as \u201crelatively easy\u201d solutions.\n\nThe report calls RPA \u201can elegant solution to several technology and human capital issues\u201d in government, including streamlining routine tasks, improving overall operational efficiency, and enhancing accuracy and compliance.\n\n\u201cWe have been leveraging the benefits of RPA for some time now. We use it in automating business processes, especially when dealing with integrating processes and data between disparate legacy systems,\u201d Melinda Rogers, chief information officer (CIO) at the Department of Justice, said in the report.\n\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s compiling cybersecurity, monitoring data from sources or optimizing complex workflows, robotic process automation has allowed justice to move forward with automation for critical business functions without having to invest in a whole system or platform efforts,\u201d Rogers added.\n\nDue to its many benefits, the report says, \u201cRPA is close to a \u2018must have\u2019 for modernization or transformation initiatives.\u201d It recommends that agencies follow what IBM is calling the \u201cRCCE model\u201d when assessing RPA candidates: Repeatability, Consistency, Criticality, and Ease.\n\nAs for generative AI, the report says it has the potential to play a \u201ckey role\u201d in government technology modernization. However, to leverage generative AI effectively, the report warns that government leaders must ensure its ethical use and compliance with regulatory frameworks.\n\n\u201cMy guess would be that we probably have about 6 percent of our knowledge structured. It\u2019s a bit ironic that we take a lot of confidence from that structured information, but it only represents 6 percent of our knowledge,\u201d Alexis Bonnell, the CIO and director of the Digital Capabilities Directorate at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), said in the report.\n\n\u201cThe surprise and excitement for me \u2013 as I look at this job now and in the coming years \u2013 is the ability to put all of our knowledge on the table, to be able to use generative AI,\u201d Bonnell said.\n\nAccording to the report, generative AI can assist in government modernization \u201cthrough mindful and responsible automating and streamlining administrative processes.\u201d Additionally, it can drive transformation in citizen engagement and service delivery, as well as support decision-making and scenario planning.\n\n\u201cPeople [in large part] are turning to generative AI tools, including GPT, to reduce toil \u2013 to take things that might have taken them four hours before and get them done in four minutes. To be clear, AI isn\u2019t about giving us the answers. It\u2019s helping us curate and have options at speed and scale,\u201d Bonnell added.\n\nNevertheless, the report closes by encouraging government technology leaders to balance both short-term and long-term strategies of digital transformation and modernization in order to create and maintain public value.\n\n\u201cThis dual focus ensures that immediate operational efficiencies are achieved while laying the groundwork for future advancements,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe maturation of next-generation digital technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and quantum computing, will only amplify the importance of this balanced approach.\u201d",

            "content": "Cybersecurity concerns in 2024 can be summed up in two letters: AI (or five letters if you narrow it down to gen AI). Organizations are still in the early stages of understanding the risks and rewards of this technology. For all the good it can do to improve data protection, keep up with compliance regulations and enable faster threat detection, threat actors are also using AI to accelerate their social engineering attacks and sabotage AI models with malware.\n\nAI might have gotten the lion\u2019s share of attention in 2024, but it wasn\u2019t the only cyber threat organizations had to deal with. Credential theft continues to be problematic, with a 71% year-over-year increase in attacks using compromised credentials. The skills shortage continues, costing companies an additional $1.76 million in a data breach aftermath. And as more companies rely on the cloud, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that there has been a spike in cloud intrusions.\n\nBut there have been positive steps in cybersecurity over the past year. CISA\u2019s Secure by Design program signed on more than 250 software manufacturers to improve their cybersecurity hygiene. CISA also introduced its Cyber Incident Reporting Portal to improve the way organizations share cyber information.\n\nLast year\u2019s cybersecurity predictions focused heavily on AI and its impact on how security teams will operate in the future. This year\u2019s predictions also emphasize AI, showing that cybersecurity may have reached a point where security and AI are interdependent on each other, for both good and bad.\n\nHere are this year\u2019s predictions.\n\nShadow AI is everywhere (Akiba Saeedi, Vice President, IBM Security Product Management)\n\nShadow AI will prove to be more common \u2014 and risky \u2014 than we thought. Businesses have more and more generative AI models deployed across their systems each day, sometimes without their knowledge. In 2025, enterprises will truly see the scope of \u201cshadow AI\u201d \u2013 unsanctioned AI models used by staff that aren\u2019t properly governed. Shadow AI presents a major risk to data security, and businesses that successfully confront this issue in 2025 will use a mix of clear governance policies, comprehensive workforce training and diligent detection and response.\n\nIdentity\u2019s transformation (Wes Gyure, Executive Director, IBM Security Product Management)\n\nHow enterprises think about identity will continue to transform in the wake of hybrid cloud and app modernization initiatives. Recognizing that identity has become the new security perimeter, enterprises will continue their shift to an Identity-First strategy, managing and securing access to applications and critical data, including gen AI models. In 2025, a fundamental component of this strategy is to build an effective identity fabric, a product-agnostic integrated set of identity tools and services. When done right, this will be a welcome relief to security professionals, taming the chaos and risk caused by a proliferation of multicloud environments and scattered identity solutions.\n\nEveryone must work together to manage threats (Sam Hector, Global Strategy Leader, IBM Security)\n\nCybersecurity teams will no longer be able to effectively manage threats in isolation. Threats from generative AI and hybrid cloud adoption are rapidly evolving. Meanwhile, the risk quantum computing poses to modern standards of public-key encryption will become unavoidable. Given the maturation of new quantum-safe cryptography standards, there will be a drive to discover encrypted assets and accelerate the modernization of cryptography management. Next year, successful organizations will be those where executives and diverse teams jointly develop and enforce cybersecurity strategies, embedding security into the organizational culture.\n\nPrepare for post-quantum cryptography standards (Ray Harishankar, IBM Fellow, IBM Quantum Safe)\n\nAs organizations begin the transition to post-quantum cryptography over the next year, agility will be crucial to ensure systems are prepared for continued transformation, particularly as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) continues to expand its toolbox of post-quantum cryptography standards. NIST\u2019s initial post-quantum cryptography standards were a signal to the world that the time is now to start the journey to becoming quantum-safe. But equally important is the need for crypto agility, ensuring that systems can rapidly adapt to new cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms in response to changing threats, technological advances and vulnerabilities. Ideally, automation will streamline and accelerate the process.\n\nData will become a vital part of AI security (Suja Viswesan, vice president of Security Software Development, IBM)\n\nData and AI security will become an essential ingredient of trustworthy AI. \u201cTrustworthy AI\u201d is often interpreted as AI that is transparent, fair and privacy-protecting. These are critical characteristics. But if AI and the data powering it aren\u2019t also secure, then all other characteristics are compromised. In 2025, as businesses, governments and individuals interact with AI more often and with higher stakes, data and AI security will be viewed as an even more important part of the trustworthy AI recipe.\n\nOrganizations will continue learning the juxtaposition of AI\u2019s benefits and threats (Mark Hughes, Global Managing Partner, Cybersecurity Services, IBM)\n\nAs AI matures from proof-of-concept to wide-scale deployment, enterprises reap the benefits of productivity and efficiency gains, including automating security and compliance tasks to protect their data and assets. But organizations need to be aware of AI being used as a new tool or conduit for threat actors to breach long-standing security processes and protocols. Businesses need to adopt security frameworks, best practice recommendations and guardrails for AI and adapt quickly \u2014 to address both the benefits and risks associated with rapid AI advancements.\n\nGreater understanding of AI-assisted versus AI-powered threats (Troy Bettencourt, Global Partner and Head of IBM X-Force)\n\nProtect against AI-assisted threats; plan for AI-powered threats. There is a distinction between AI-powered and AI-assisted threats, including how organizations should think about their proactive security posture. AI-powered attacks, like deepfake video scams, have been limited to date; today\u2019s threats remain primarily AI-assisted \u2014 meaning AI can help threat actors create variants of existing malware or a better phishing email lure. To address current AI-assisted threats, organizations should prioritize implementing end-to-end security for their own AI solutions, including protecting user interfaces, APIs, language models and machine learning operations, while remaining mindful of strategies to defend against future AI-powered attacks.\n\nThere\u2019s a very clear message from these predictions that understanding how AI can help and hurt an organization is vital to ensuring your company and its assets are protected in 2025 and beyond.",

            "content": "After decades of population decline due to ivory poaching and habitat loss, the African forest elephant and African savanna elephant are on the list of endangered and threatened animals. The African forest elephant population, in particular, fell by more than 86 percent over 31 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which runs the list.\n\nMonitoring elephants helps conservationists develop more effective protection strategies that contribute to the long-term survival of these mammals. But that\u2019s a severe challenge, especially in the Congo Basin of Central Africa, because the basin is a dense tropical rainforest ecosystem \u2014 unlike the African savanna, a grassland ecosystem with open spaces.\n\n\u201cA drone flying over the African savanna forest can identify the animals,\u201d said Thomas Breuer, African forest elephant coordinator at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Germany. \u201cBut a drone flying over a dense canopy in the Congo won't be able to see through the canopy, so we have to estimate the number of animals.\u201d\n\nThe inability to accurately monitor elephant populations left conservationists relying on indirect methods.\n\n\u201cWe estimate numbers by counting elephant dung piles in an area, knowing both how many piles an elephant produces daily and how long these piles remain visible,\u201d Breuer said. \u201cWe also use camera traps because they help us create individual profiles of the animals. When we spot an elephant at one location and then again 50 kilometers away, we get insight into their movement patterns, which advances our understanding of these animals.\u201d\n\nTo monitor elephants more effectively, IBM and WWF announced an initiative leveraging IBM's Maximo Visual Inspection artificial intelligence (AI) technology to identify and monitor individual African forest elephants. The partnership addresses the need for precision and efficiency in tracking one of the world's most endangered species.\n\nThe tool uses labeled datasets from camera trap images to train the AI to recognize elephants by their unique physical traits \u2014 such as tusk shapes or markings on their bodies. The initial pilot is centered on a key area in the Central African Republic, where camera traps have captured photos of elephants for many years.\n\nAfrican forest elephants gather at sunrise at Dzanga Bai, a famous clearing in Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve, Central African Republic. (Image: Andy Isaacson for WWF U.S.)\n\n\u201cThe dataset we're using is unique. Many elephants \u2014 similar to those in the Congo Basin \u2014 visit this famous natural forest clearing in [Dzanga-Sangha] in the Central African Republic, where we've set up camera traps around the area to monitor known elephants,\u201d said Aditya Khosla, principal product manager for the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite. \u201cEven though these elephants are difficult to identify, we can assign them identities based on time frames and likely movements. This process enriches our learning data. The dataset's uniqueness comes from tracking elephants we already know. Without this foundation, we might only identify the most distinctive elephants, leaving many unclassified.\u201d\n\nThese datasets will help refine the AI model, which will expand to cover forests across the Congo Basin.\n\n\u201cThe model needs to understand not just different types of elephants but also identify unique individual elephants,\u201d Khosla said. \u201cWe label our datasets to track specific elephants so we know exactly who they are. When we receive new camera trap images, the system can easily recognize elephants it has seen before. This also helps us identify previously unknown elephants.\u201d\n\nBy incorporating images captured at different times of day and under varying environmental conditions, the system also improves its ability to detect elephants across diverse scenarios.\n\nAfrican forest elephants play a vital role in maintaining the health of their ecosystems, earning them the nickname \"climate heroes.\" Elephants consume over 400 pounds of food daily, and their foraging habits reshape the forest. As they move, they reduce vegetation density by damaging smaller trees with lower carbon density. This creates space for larger trees with denser wood and wider canopies, which can store more carbon dioxide. Beyond forest clearing, elephants spread seeds from carbon-dense trees through their dung, promoting healthy forest growth. Research shows a single forest elephant can boost the carbon capture capacity of forests by nearly 250 acres, offsetting emissions equivalent to that of 2,047 cars annually.\n\n\"The technology will not only help track individual elephants but also provide critical data to support broader ecosystem restoration,\u201d Khosla said. \u201cBy quantifying the elephants\u2019 contributions to carbon storage, we can better value and protect these vital animals.\"\n\nThe AI-powered solution will also streamline a traditionally manual process.\n\n\u201cOur team members will no longer need to spend weeks in dangerous swamp conditions, facing threats from snakes and other hazards, to collect this information,\u201d WWF\u2019s Breuer said. \u201cHaving experienced this personally along with many others, I can say that finding an alternative to manual counting is already a tremendous improvement.\u201d\n\nCamera traps placed in known elephant habitats capture images continuously. These images are fed into the AI model, enabling conservationists to monitor individual elephants\u2019 movements and population dynamics in near real-time.\n\n\u201cConsider that with this method we'll be able to identify 70 percent of elephants in a given area,\u201d Breuer said. \u201cThis 30 percent margin of error is minimal compared to our current indirect counting methods.\u201d\n\nWhile the immediate goal is to monitor elephant populations, the broader implications of the technology are profound. By integrating this data with IBM's Environmental Intelligence Suite, a set of tools designed for those working with environmental data to increase climate resilience and business efficiency, the project aims to assess the impact of elephant activities on forest growth. This could provide a clearer picture of how nature contributes to carbon capture and broader ecosystem services.\n\n\u201cI'm confident that combining this AI tool with our expertise in direct observation, fieldwork, and manual identification will make the system even more accurate,\u201d Breuer said. \u201cWe'll not only be able to measure the impact of our conservation efforts but also track individual movements, especially of larger male elephants, between locations. This helps us identify crucial wildlife corridors. The impact on conservation is significant. We will be able to determine elephant populations in specific locations with unprecedented precision.\u201d\n\nBreuer further envisions a future where this technology can transform conservation strategies globally.\n\n\u201cWe've planned a two-year collaboration with IBM to develop and refine this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe this partnership is truly groundbreaking and will revolutionize conservation in the Congo Basin.\u201d\n\nFor WWF and IBM, success will be measured in elephant counts and the depth of insights generated. The project\u2019s first phase aims to identify individual elephants in two pilot forests, with plans to expand regionally over the next two years.\n\n\"Ultimately, we hope to integrate AI insights with carbon credit frameworks, ensuring the economic value of protecting elephants is recognized and supported,\u201d Khosla said.",

Barbie Robinson, the former Sonoma County health services director who first negotiated the contract, is facing felony bid-rigging charges for a similar IBM contract she championed in Harris County, Texas.\n\nLocal officials have yet to investigate how Sonoma County\u2019s IBM contract was rolled out, even as charges in Texas mount against Robinson.\n\nHowever, Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore and former Supervisor Susan Gorin, say county officials should look into it, and a third board member, Chris Coursey, says the county should find out exactly what taxpayers got for their $13 million.\n\nACCESS Sonoma was spearheaded by Robinson, who left for Houston in the spring of 2021 to become public health director in Harris County, where she immediately sought a similar contract with IBM.\n\nIn November, then-Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg charged Robinson with a felony, alleging she provided inside information to IBM during the competitive bidding process for the $31 million contract for data-hosting services and case management software.\n\nOn Dec. 23, the district attorney\u2019s office filed additional felony charges against Robinson for violating the contract bidding process with an unrelated Sonoma County company \u2014 DEMA, the county\u2019s dominant pandemic-era emergency housing contractor \u2014 and failing to report a conflict of interest in the IBM deal.\n\nRobinson is accused of giving IBM an advantage in the public procurement process after her attempt to sign the company without competitive bidding was rejected by the county\u2019s purchasing department.\n\nOgg\u2019s term as district attorney expired at the end of the year. She\u2019s now working as a senior policy adviser for Harris County Commissioner Tom Ramsey.\n\nThe new district attorney, Sean Teare, took office Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWe are still evaluating the case to determine what steps, if any, to take in the future,\u201d Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said in an email Thursday.\n\nSonoma program a model\n\nSonoma County\u2019s IBM program, ACCESS Sonoma, is cited in the Harris County case as a model that Robinson intended to replicate in Texas.\n\nHarris County charging documents describe email communications between Robinson, IBM employee Kenneth Wolsey and others connected to Sonoma County, including Carolyn Staats, who leads the innovation division in the information services department and helped launch ACCESS Sonoma.\n\nIn a Nov. 2, 2021, email to Robinson and Staats, Wolsey said he shared a list of project manager duties based on similar roles in Sonoma, Orange and San Diego counties \u201cin case you want to shape\u201d a job description for Harris County.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll forward anything else that Carrie provides, but this should give you a good starting place to create a job description for Harris County,\u201d Wolsey wrote, referring to a San Diego County employee.\n\nThe Harris County charging documents allege the email demonstrates how IBM helped develop Harris County\u2019s ACCESS program \u201cfor which it is making a competitive bid later in the same month.\u201d\n\nIn a Nov. 15, 2021, email, four days before Harris County issued its request for proposals, Wolsey informed Robinson and Staats that he would \u201cbe watching for the RFP or other instructions needed for the Harris County proposal \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe team is working on items they\u2019re able to do in advance,\u201d he added.\n\nThe exchange is evidence that IBM \u201cwas aware of the details of the RFP before it was made public,\u201d the DA said in the charging documents.\n\nStaats did not respond to an email requesting an interview and county officials declined requests to interview Staats.\n\nGore, the Sonoma County supervisor, said he has asked County Executive Christina Rivera to review the contract.\n\n\u201cAny time there\u2019s an allegation of a contracting issue that includes our employees, that\u2019s an area of concern in need of following up,\u201d Gore told The Press Democrat.\n\nGorin, who retired from the board last week, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think the first order of business is that the county executive and the interim (health services) director will have to maybe do some investigation about how the ACCESS program rolled out in Sonoma County and if there are any parallels,\u201d she said.",

Krishna shared with Cloud Wars Founder Bob Evans the company\u2019s optimistic outlook for 2025 amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties. They also discuss IBM\u2019s shift towards software, its AWS and Palo Alto Network partnerships, and how Red Hat has flourished since joining IBM.\n\nHighlights\n\nIBM\u2019s Optimistic Outlook (01:18)\n\nDespite current geopolitical and economic uncertainties, Krishna remains optimistic about technology\u2019s role, especially in terms of automation and AI, in driving business transformations. He notes there\u2019s an increased appetite for technology globally, including in Europe, as a response to these uncertainties. Technology is a way to deliver better services at lower costs, which makes it an exciting time for the technology business.\n\nFocus on Delighting Clients (03:41)\n\nIBM exists to serve clients, focusing on delighting them through technology deployment and support. Krishna discusses the importance of taking risks to innovate and the need to cut bureaucracy and unnecessary processes. He emphasizes that partnerships should be win-win scenarios. \u201cCan we expand the pie in which case we both win because the client is happier?\u201d\n\nIBM\u2019s Shift to Software and Impact on Clients (06:36)\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant shift in IBM\u2019s revenue mix, with software now accounting for almost half of IBM\u2019s revenue. Krishna explains that software\u2019s flexibility allows for incremental improvements, unlike hardware, which often require more disruptive changes. IBM focuses on software and providing unique value to clients in automation, hybrid cloud, data, and AI.\n\nEnterprise Adoption of Large Language Models (10:05)\n\nKrishna talks about the current state of enterprise understanding of large language models, or LLMs: \u201cIf I look at the enterprise understanding of large language models and what we can do for them, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in the first innings of a baseball game.\u201d Krishna advises enterprises to move forward in three steps: First, start with low-risk applications like customer experience functions such as answering service calls, as well as internal enterprise functions. Second, move to a little more risky but not totally risky use cases, like accounts receivable, procurement, and supply chain. Then, step three is applying LLMs to things like oncology and diagnosis in healthcare \u2014 vertical-industry-specific functions. The excitement is more on step three, but customers should initially focus on the first two, where there\u2019s a lot of value.\n\nLeveraging Automation to Drive Innovation (15:04)\n\nAll enterprises understand the importance of running lean and using productivity gains to focus resources on high-value activities. Krishna shares that IBM has freed up resources by automating tasks, allowing for more R&D to develop innovative products. He notes that overall employment has increased, but more focus is on high-value activities that enhance growth rates.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nRed Hat\u2019s Growth and Role in Hybrid Cloud (16:59)\n\nRed Hat has had impressive growth since joining IBM. Krishna says it has more than doubled its revenue since joining IBM in 2019, now exceeding $6 billion. He explains that Red Hat is the leading hybrid cloud platform, allowing for flexibility in deploying workloads across data centers and cloud environments.\n\nR&D as a Growth Engine (21:40)\n\nR&D should focus on innovation and quickly bringing those innovations to clients. R&D is about identifying unmet needs. \u201cHenry Ford was asked like, how did you think of the Model T? And his answer was \u2018Look, if I had surveyed my customers, they would have said they wanted a stronger horse or a longer whip, but the automobile was the right answer.\u2019 Krishna mentions that quantum computing is a key area of focus for IBM in terms of research and development.\n\nThe Benefits of Strategic Partnerships (24:56)\n\nIBM\u2019s strategic partnerships impact client value and IBM\u2019s growth. Krishna notes that half of IBM\u2019s consulting team\u2019s revenue now comes from these partnerships. He provides the example of IBM helping Delta Airlines move to AWS, while integrating Red Hat and other tools to enhance the client\u2019s experience. Krishna talks about a new partnership with security software provider Palo Alto Networks that\u2019s expected to generate significant pipeline for IBM\u2019s consulting team.\n\nFinal Thoughts and Future Outlook (27:56)\n\nKrishna encourages clients to assign technology the same importance as other critical functions like finance and marketing. \u201cDo you give tech the same importance that you give your CFO?\u201d He reiterates the importance of technology and the need for businesses to adapt to its rapid pace of change. Evans closes by observing that in 2025, there\u2019s potential for the Cloud Wars Top 10 companies to exceed $10 trillion in combined market cap.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEngineers are struggling to develop generative AI tools and applications, according to IBM research published Wednesday . Morning Consult conducted the survey of more than 1,000 U.S.-based enterprise AI developers .\n\nWhile AI developers say high performance, flexibility and ease of use are critical for enterprise tooling, those traits are also the rarest among available solutions, the report found. Engineers often point to the lack of standardization in the development process, difficulty developing ethical lifecycles and the need for customization as the top inhibitors of progress.\n\nEnterprise developers typically use between five and 15 tools to create AI applications. More than 1 in 10 developers leverage 15 or more in the process, and nearly all use coding assistants in some capacity to save time.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDeveloping enterprise-grade generative AI applications is critical for businesses across industries, but tool and tech stack complexities can derail the efforts.\n\nAI developers have only grown in importance since the race to adopt generative AI kicked off more than two years ago. Last year, the role entered the top 10 highest-paid positions for the first time, according to a Stack Overflow survey published in September 2024. Last year, AI developers earned around $160,000 in annual compensation.\n\nWhile AI-specific roles are still relatively new, enterprise interest is palpable. Machine learning and AI engineering positions have grown 27x since 2014, according to a SignalFire report. Comparatively, roles for cloud engineering and DevOps only jumped about three-fold in the same period.\n\nEnterprises have worked to enhance the developer experience and keep employees engaged as their job market prospects proliferate. JPMorgan Chase, for example, focused on simplifying workflows even as the environment became more complex.\n\nThe potential benefits of AI skills have also pushed technology workers to beef up their own AI skills. Demand for prompt engineering courses increased by 456% year over year, according to O\u2019Reilly data.\n\nAs generative AI reshapes existing workflows and job functions, Gartner predicts around 4 in 5 engineers will need to upskill by 2027.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Generative AI - Where Are We Now?, from the editorial team at CIO Dive.

It\u2019s not reasonable, for example, to expect developers, on their own, to be able to determine which AI models at any given time might provide the highest level of performance at the lowest cost possible, she noted.\n\nIn addition to cost and performance concerns, organizations will also need to consider the impact AI models might have on sustainability goals as well, said Ashoori.\n\nIn fact, there may be a need for a software engineering teams to swap out one AI model for another as requirements change or advances are made using other AI models that might provide higher levels of optimization, she added.\n\nSuccessful organizations are investing in the software engineering and machine learning operations (MLOps) expertise needed to support developers as they embrace AI technologies, said Ashoori. It\u2019s simply not enough to present developers with an application programming interface (API) through which they might hopefully be able to invoke some type of AI tool, she noted. Instead, organizations should be developing templates that make it simpler for development teams to invoke AI capabilities, said Ashoori.\n\nNot surprisingly, less than one quarter (24%) of application developers surveyed ranked themselves as \u201cexperts\u201d in generative AI. Nevertheless, almost all (99%) are also exploring or developing AI agents. The top AI agent concern identified is trustworthiness (31%).\n\nIn general, the survey finds 41% of respondents reporting that AI tools are saving them one to two hours per day, with 22% saving three hours or more per day. Developers typically evaluate AI tools based on performance (42%), flexibility (41%), ease of use (40%), and integration (36%), the survey finds.\n\nA total of 72% of respondents report using between five and 15 tools to create an AI enterprise application, with 135 using 15 or more tools. Only one-third of those surveyed, however, are willing to invest more than two hours in learning a new AI development tool.\n\nWhile application developers are clearly spending less time coding, it\u2019s not clear to what degree AI is actually accelerating the pace at which organizations are deploying software faster. There are multiple software engineering processes that collectively limit the rate at which most organizations can practically deploy software in production environments. The challenge and opportunity heading into 2025 will be to operationalize AI in a way that goes well beyond simply writing more code faster.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other quantum computing stocks.\n\nQuantum computing is a revolutionary technology that integrates quantum physics properties into a computer. This technology has the potential to revolutionize industries by solving complex issues at a rapid pace as compared to traditional computing methods. Notably, businesses across sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation, continue to explore several benefits of quantum computing in a bid to have a competitive edge and fuel innovation.\n\nTrends To Watch Out For in 2025\n\nHeading into 2025, government aid, strategic initiatives, and legislative support for research are some of the key trends likely to fuel growth. In July 2024, US Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet highlighted the Department of Commerce\u2019s announcement that Colorado\u2019s Elevate Quantum was given $40.5 million in federal funding to build the nation\u2019s leading quantum ecosystem.\n\nHickenlooper added that Colorado is regarded as the Silicon Valley of the quantum era, and Elevate Quantum is expected to lead. Hickenlooper went on to say that Quantum is well-placed to revolutionize medical drug discovery, supercharge AI, strengthen US cybersecurity, and support the transition to clean energy.\n\nAlso, in late November 2024, The Senate advanced the Department of Energy (DOE) Quantum Leadership Act of 2024, proposing $2.5 billion over 5 years to fuel US quantum R&D. Notably, the bipartisan bill emphasizes quantum networking, domestic manufacturing, and public-private partnerships to ramp up quantum innovation.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nIndustries Likely to Benefit\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that quantum computers possess the potential to reduce global carbon emissions by 7 gigatons by 2035 and 150 gigatons by the upcoming 30 years, while adding up to $1.3 trillion in value to key transition industries, as per McKinsey. The rapid computational power it promises is expected to revolutionize batteries for electrification, transform carbon-heavy industrial operations, establish cleaner methods for agriculture, and help reimagine fuel\u2019s future.\n\nGrand View Research highlighted that the growth in the quantum computing market in the US should be driven by higher government and private sector investment in quantum technologies.

For a company with USD$1 billion in revenue, this translates to approximately USD$33.2 million annually.\n\nThese investments extend beyond IT departments to functions such as customer service, supply chain operations, talent acquisition, and marketing innovation. The adoption of AI across enterprises is also expected to expand significantly, with the proportion of companies using AI projected to rise from 49 per cent today to 89 per cent within three years.\n\nThis integration aims to enhance innovation and operational efficiency. However, governance remains a challenge. While 87 per cent of executives report having clear AI governance frameworks, fewer than 25 per cent have fully implemented and regularly review tools to address risks like bias, transparency, and security, revealing a gap in operational oversight.\n\n\u201cRetail and consumer product companies are at a tipping point where embedding AI across their operations can define not just productivity gains, but the future of brand relevance, engagement, and trust,\u201d said Dee Waddell, IBM\u2019s Global Industry Leader for Consumer, Travel & Transportation Industries said.\n\nRead more: Predictive Oncology shares rise 71% as takeover by Renovaro is announced\n\nRead more: Serve Robotics shares reach all new highs on investments from big tech\n\nStudy performed with Oxford Economics\n\nThe report highlights that successful brands evolve by positioning AI as a core driver of enterprise innovation rather than just means of boosting productivity. Furthermore, companies must rethink governance and reskilling strategies to achieve this transformation.\n\nRetailers should align AI initiatives with their brand priorities and collaborate with strategic partners, such as start-ups and technology companies, according to the report. This involves dissolving the silos between finance, technology, and business leaders. By fostering cross-functional collaboration, stakeholders actively build strong business cases that demonstrate AI\u2019s potential to deliver a long-term competitive advantage.\n\nOxford Economics helped perform the study. It came about as an equal split between retail and consumer product executives. Participants responded to a range of questions through various formats, including multiple-choice and Likert scale, focusing on their expectations, results, concerns, and barriers related to scaling AI within their organizations and across their ecosystem partners.\n\n.\n\nFollow Mugglehead on Twitter\n\nLike Mugglehead on Facebook\n\nFollow Joseph Morton on Twitter\n\njoseph@mugglehead.com",

AI use in customer service, particularly for personalized responses and follow-ups, could grow by 236% in the next 12 months when compared to the prior year based on survey responses. Notably, responses indicate that 55% of these improvements are expected to involve human-AI collaboration, while only 30% would be fully automated\u2014highlighting the need to equip employees for seamless AI integration.\n\nExecutives surveyed expect that 31% of employees will need to learn new skills to work with AI in the next year, increasing to 45% within three years.

Respondents indicated they expect growth from 52% today to 89% within three years as their companies look to blend AI capabilities with business and technology partners to accelerate innovation and drive efficiencies. AI Governance Gap: Despite 87% of surveyed executives claiming to have clear AI governance frameworks, fewer than 25% have fully implemented and continuously review tools to manage risks like bias, transparency, and security. This reveals a critical gap in operational oversight.\n\n\"AI is no longer just a tool; it's a strategic imperative,\" said Dee Waddell, Global Industry Leader, Consumer, Travel & Transportation Industries at IBM. \"Retail and consumer product companies are at a tipping point where embedding AI across their operations can help define not just productivity gains, but the future of brand relevance, engagement and trust.\"\n\nThe report emphasizes that successful brands can evolve from viewing AI as merely a productivity booster to positioning it as a core driver of enterprise innovation. Achieving this transformation will require rethinking traditional governance and reskilling strategies. Retailers should tailor AI initiatives to align with their brand priorities and collaborate with strategic partners, including start-ups and technology companies. Equally important is breaking down silos between finance, technology, and business leaders. By fostering cross-functional collaboration, these stakeholders can jointly build strong business cases that demonstrate how AI can help deliver a long-term competitive advantage.\n\nConnect with IBM at NRF 2025: AI is taking center stage for IBM at NRF'25.

            "content": "Despite IBM\u2019s 2017 ban on remote working, several companies have adopted it as a full-time operating model. In this article, we look at three companies that went 100% remote, as well as key ideas and benefits powering this trend.\n\nIn 2017, we wrote about IBM\u2019s new policy against working from home, stating that it needed agile teams to be present in the office. Despite significant gains from the previous work-from-home benefits (which allowed IBM to reduce office space by 78 million square feet), the global technology giant decided to end the era of remote working.\n\nFast forward three years, and working from home is now more popular than ever before. There are even 100% remote companies, where the entire workforce is distributed across the globe, working from different time zones. How does this benefit a company? Did IBM take the right call by banning remote work, or is the virtual, globally distributed office the way forward in 2020? Let\u2019s explore this further, with insights from three remote work companies.\n\nLearn More: Working from Anywhere Works Better for Everyone\n\nHow 3 Fully Remote Work Companies Maximize Working From Home\n\nToday, most companies offer flexible working as a key employee benefit.\n\nIt allows employees to maintain work-life balance, save hours on commuting, and energize themselves after a high-pressure work period (for example, after a product launch). But typically, in most companies, remote work is limited to a specific number of days or hours every year.\n\nHere are three companies that have taken remote working a step further. In contrast to IBM\u2019s no work from home mandate, Buffer, Zapier, and GitLab have a 100% remote workforce.\n\n1. Buffer argues against the \u201calways online\u201d culture\n\nOne would expect a remote work company to rely heavily on technology, ensuring employees are online, accessible, and available for a quick chat. However, this could cause undue stress and negatively impact work-life balance. That\u2019s why BufferOpens a new window lets employees design their workday as they see fit while maintaining transparency.\n\n\u201c[A typical day] depends on the person\u2019s role and habits, there is no one right answer here. Generally, people will start their day either by logging into Slack to check in with their team or getting started immediately on their work. The team isn\u2019t required to check in on Slack first thing, though many do,\u201d saidOpens a new window Hailley GriffisOpens a new window , head of public relations for Buffer, speaking to We Work Remotely.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re all so spread out, the day ends at different times for everyone. Many people will share in Slack before they sign off to let their team know they won\u2019t be online anymore,\u201d she added.\n\nGriffis also believes that remote working doesn\u2019t necessarily bring down productivity. For Fortune 500 companies apprehensive about going remote because it makes it harder to track productivity, she had a valuable insight: \u201cMany companies [track productivity] simply by the number of hours that someone is sitting at their desk, which isn\u2019t necessarily representative of what they are accomplishing.\u201d\n\nInstead, she recommends that companies define remote-friendly productivity key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n2. Zapier prioritizes employee connectivity and managerial skills\n\nZapierOpens a new window is a 100% remote work company with 200 employees spread across multiple countries. The company pays particular attention to managerial skill sets, as these are the individuals who lead remote teams towards success.\n\nWade FosterOpens a new window , co-founder and CEO of Zapier, encourages managers to check in with the team, discuss employee experiences, and share anecdotes/issues from their personal lives. Zapier even has a Slack integration called Donut, which creates a randomized group of three employees. Every group must take out time to discuss their likes and preferences and get to know each other a little better.\n\n\u201cIf you kind of already know the person and you know them on a human level, it just makes it easier to connect with them when you get into the trenches and have to solve something really, really tough,\u201d saidOpens a new window Foster on a podcast with author and futurist Jacob Morgan.\n\nHe also had useful advice for managers at remote work companies: \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. Being a manager in a remote environment is not so different than being a good manager in an office. A lot of the things that you need to do are the same. So, find the remote equivalent of those things and make it happen.\u201d\n\n3. GitLab sponsors face-to-face meets with a \u201cvisiting grant\u201d\n\nAt GitLabOpens a new window , remote work is embedded into the company\u2019s culture and mission statement. It even has a Remote Manifesto as well as a handbook that explains the principles of their remote work policy. GitLab has team members in 65+ countries around the world and encourages in-person interactions among them.\n\n\u201cWe have a visiting grant at GitLab, to bring people together. If you want to visit a colleague in another part of the world or promote GitLab at events in another country, then present your travel plan to your manager or the CEO, and you can receive up to $2,000 in support for your plan,\u201d saidOpens a new window self-employed marketing content manager, Heather McNamee, writing for GitLab\u2019s official blog.\n\nGitLab tries to bring employees together in myriad small ways, such as making video calls with their pets and frequently spend time away from the keyboard, even on a workday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re expected to get your work done and organize your own time. Another typical thing is to be chatting 1:1 with someone, and someone else will say: Hey, we should bring this to a group channel so others can see,\u201d said McNamee.\n\nBuffer, Zapier, and GitLab aren\u2019t alone in their company-wide adoption of remote working. Giants like Accenture or Microsoft are also eager to embrace remote work.\n\nLearn More: The Future of Remote Work in 2020 and Beyond \u2013 8 Tips for HROpens a new window\n\nThe Benefits of Remote Work, With Insights From Accenture and Microsoft\n\nRemote work is a highly sought-after benefit among employees. A U.K. survey Opens a new window of 2,000 employees and 500+ companies found that \u201cflexible work\u201d was among the top three benefits in demand. 44% of women professionals say they would prioritize work-life balance, as opposed to 35% who prioritized salary.\n\nAnother survey of nearly 2,500 remote workersOpens a new window revealed the clear benefits of going remote:\n\n40% of respondents said that remote work companies allow them to have a flexible schedule and route their efforts more intelligently.\n\nEmployees don\u2019t abuse this flexibility. Most remote workers get unlimited vacation time but take only 2\u20133 weeks off per year.\n\n44% of respondents say that they combine travel with work for at least one week a year. This has a positive impact on mental wellness and personal fulfillment.\n\nInterestingly, 40% of companies were only partially remote while remaining team members work out of the same office. This allows companies to gain from a varied talent pool without locational constraints.\n\nThis is probably why even large companies and Fortune 500s are making inroads into remote work.\n\n\u201cAt Microsoft, we\u2019re big advocates of remote working. We know that each individual has their own preferences of where, when, and how they want to work. Getting this right enables productivity, creativity, deep work, innovation, and teambuilding,\u201d saidOpens a new window Jess Crandon, digital storyteller at Microsoft writing on the company blog.\n\nSimilarly, Accenture has introduced a highly flexible remote work benefits, freeing its employees to choose their priorities.\n\nRobbie GibbonsOpens a new window , director of operations at Accenture, is on an 80% contract with the company. This means that he works from Monday to Thursday, switching between the office and his home. He takes Friday off to spend time with his children, and this keen focus on work-life balance hasn\u2019t impacted career progression.\n\n\u201cI was promoted to Associate Director in 2018 \u2013 a clear indicator that at Accenture, it\u2019s possible to achieve career growth while working part-time,\u201d saidOpens a new window Gibbons, writing for Accenture.\n\nLearn More: 3 Experts on How to Maximize Value from Remote Employees\n\nWrapping Up\n\nSimply put, remote work is now essential to attract talent in a difficult labor market. These examples of partial and fully remote work companies suggest that flexibility, productivity, and employee-centric work experience go together. While IBM may have ended its remote work policy, this benefit continues to be central to most companies out there. In 2020, we expect remote work to be the new business normal \u2013 and not an exception \u2013 as companies try to gain from the best talent, while employees continue to strengthen their work-life balance.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the future of remote work companies?

The collaborative intent is not only to improve client relationships but also to build a robust foundation for enterprise success, she said about IBM\u2019s acquisition of Oracle-services provider Accelalpha that was finalized in Q4 2024.\n\nThe acquisition marks a significant milestone in IBM\u2019s growth trajectory as it adds crucial finance and supply chain capabilities to its offerings. Moreover, the company has grown its geographic reach with Accelalpha\u2019s team of consultants across North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America, onboarding at IBM on the completion of the deal.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nKoppel noted, \u201cWe\u2019re focused on four key geographies for growth: the Americas, the UK & Ireland, and Japan. Now, with Accelalpha, we\u2019re able to enhance that reach across all these regions while adding focus to our key markets.\u201d\n\nPaul Pessutti, Senior Vice President at Oracle, expressed his optimism about the acquisition, describing it as \u201cthe coming together of two exceptional firms where we already have strong, deep relationships and trust built up within Oracle and with our clients.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment resonated with Dan Haller, Group Vice President at Oracle, who observed that customers, especially in the supply chain space, who need enterprise transformations, could really benefit from the partnership. \u201c[We have] some strong functional supply chain capabilities, and IBM is well known as a global systems invitation partner that works with customers strategically in the industries it is focused on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe collaboration between Accelalpha and IBM is viewed as a \u201clogical marriage\u201d by Joe Spear, Partner at Accelalpha.\n\nThe combined capabilities of both organizations promise to deliver comprehensive solutions that address core business challenges globally. Spear noted that Accelalpha excels in Oracle implementations covering core ERP, Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), logistics, and customer experience suites\u2014components essential for addressing fundamental business issues.\n\nWith IBM\u2019s distinguished managed services portfolio, both companies are poised to deliver end-to-end support for clients, enhancing the client experience post-implementation.\n\nKevin Beyer, Managing Partner at Accelalpha, expressed enthusiasm about integrating this service with Accelalpha\u2019s offerings for continuous support and software lifecycle management. \u201cIBM is ranked as a global leader in the managed service offering, and we\u2019re able to bring that to our customers now,\u201d he said.\n\nAn exciting frontier of this partnership is the integration of Generative AI (GenAI). Teams from all three organizations are eager to collaborate and leverage AI capabilities to enhance business processes.\n\nChacko Thomas, Americas Oracle Practice Leader at IBM, illustrated practical applications where intelligent workflows can rapidly assess business processes and provide swift ROI assessments.\n\nAs the wheels of this partnership continue to turn, the collaboration between IBM, Oracle, and Accelalpha promises to be transformative for enterprises seeking innovative solutions and strategies.\n\nThomas concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about this right from our announcement of the acquisition. We are committed to keeping the Oracle channels whole. We have committed to keeping the business model, which includes pricing and other things. In fact, Accelalpha will now have access to all of IBM\u2019s enterprise bands, so it will only get better in terms of scale and depth.\u201d",

            "content": "IBM toxic spill aftermath and Endicott water infrastructure: Why the village filed lawsuit\n\n(This story was updated to accurately reflect the most current information.)\n\nNearly a decade after IBM reached a settlement with 1,000 plaintiffs stemming from toxic spills at the company's former Endicott manufacturing plant, the Village of Endicott has filed a lawsuit against the company in federal court.\n\nWork began to dismantle the former IBM office building on North Street in Endicott on Dec. 31. In a lawsuit filed earlier in December, the village called for financial compensation from IBM, alleging the company's actions contaminated the village water supply with toxic substances in the soil and groundwater, which have since entered the village's water supply wells, forcing them to be shut down.\n\nThe lawsuit claims IBM improperly disposed of hazardous materials including 1,4 Dioxane, PFAS and various other toxic substances tied to developmental problems, kidney and liver damage as well as cancer.\n\nMore: Demolition starts on Endicott IBM building to create shovel-ready development site\n\nIBM used some of these chemicals to clean computer parts, and then dumped them down drains, which leaked out of pipes into the ground below IBM's Endicott locations, the suit claims, arguing IBM knew or should have known the toxins would enter groundwater, ultimately affecting the village's drinking water supply.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, six spills and leaks occurred on IBM grounds since 1979, including an initial spill of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank, which released circuit board solvents into the ground. These spills also created an underground chemical plume, which released toxic gases within a 350-acre area south of IBM's campus.\n\nThe plume caused toxic gas to be released under 480 personal residences \u2014 an issue which cost IBM tens of millions of dollars to clean. In 2015, a settlement between IBM and a group of Endicott residents was reached, with IBM continuing environmental cleanup in the area with a total of over 20 recovery wells, and recovering over 800,000 pounds of toxic chemicals from the ground underneath the village.\n\nVillage of Endicott wells shut down\n\nEndicott Mayor Nick Burlingame said IBM has directly caused multiple water wells to be shut down, and must be held accountable.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the Village of Endicott has been working to clean up damage to our water infrastructure left behind by IBM. While our drinking water supply is monitored daily and is safe for consumption, our water sources have been reduced to a single well due to contamination, which is unacceptable for our residents and businesses,\u201d Burlingame said in a statement. \u201cThis litigation seeks to ensure IBM takes responsibility for the resources and restorations to our water wells which are necessary to protect public health.\"\n\nBurlingame said an additional well will be built in 2025 outside the village, though still within the Town of Union.\n\nIBM said Wednesday the company will be contesting the lawsuit moving forward.\n\n\"IBM's more than 40 years of remediation activities in Endicott, in partnership with the village and state, demonstrates our longstanding commitment to the health and safety of the residents of the community,\u201d Sarah Minkel, issues and crisis manager for IBM, said in a statement. \u201cThere is no justification for the demands being made by the Village of Endicott in this matter, and IBM will vigorously defend itself.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit calls for compensation from IBM for all past, current and future costs, including testing, design and installation of new water treatment systems, maintenance costs, land acquisition and engineering fees.",

            "content": "IBM and semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries have settled a long-running dispute over intellectual property.\n\nBack in 2015, GlobalFoundries \u2013 the chipmaking unit of AMD which was spun out in 2009 \u2013 took over IBM's loss-making chip-manufacturing operation. It agreed to provide IBM with high-performance Power processors for mainframes and IBM's Watson AI technology as the sole supplier over a ten-year period.\n\nIn return, GlobalFoundries was to be given access to some of IBM's intellectual property, along with the physical assets of IBM Microelectronics. The deal saw IBM paying $1.5 billion to get rid of the manufacturing unit after failing to find a buyer.\n\nHowever, in 2021, IBM filed a lawsuit against the company in New York state court, saying it was in breach of the contract by failing to supply the chips and asking for $2.5 billion in damages.\n\nGlobalFoundries had halted the 7nm-class process technology required to make the processors for IBM, saying the size of its customer base didn't make the process cost-effective.\n\nThen, two years later, GlobalFoundries launched its own lawsuit against IBM in New York federal court, claiming that IBM had been misappropriating trade secrets related to next-generation process technologies and sharing them with Intel and Japanese state-backed consortium Rapidus.\n\nGlobalFoundries said at the time that it was also concerned that the trade secrets might have been shared more widely. And, it said, IBM had made hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing fees as a result of these deals.\n\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Sign up today and you will receive a free copy of our Focus Report 2025 - the leading guidance on AI, cybersecurity and other IT challenges as per 700+ senior executives Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAnd, if that weren't enough, the company claimed that IBM had been poaching some of its most qualified semiconductor manufacturing engineers.\n\nNow, both disputes have been settled in a confidential agreement that, the firms said, covers all breach of contract, trade secrets, and intellectual property claims between the two companies.\n\n\"Resolving these disputes is a significant step forward for our companies and will allow us to both focus on future innovations that will benefit our organizations and customers,\" said Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM.\n\nThe two companies said they now plan to collaborate again in future.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached a positive resolution with IBM, and we look forward to new opportunities to build upon our long-standing partnership to further strengthen the semiconductor industry,\" said Dr Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GlobalFoundries.\n\nIn November, the US Commerce Department awarded GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to increase production at its New York and Vermont plants, as part of a campaign to strengthen home-grown semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe company was, it said, one of only four companies outside China that had the capabilities to provide for current and future needs, and the only one headquartered in the US.\n\nHowever, last year it was fined $500,000 under the Chips and Science Act for shipping chip components to a Chinese company in violation of sanctions.",

Lord, a former IBM executive, will report to Horizon founder and CEO Bill Koenigsberg .\n\nKoenigsberg Lord worked for nearly a decade at IBM, serving as the company\u2019s first chief digital officer, and handled tasks including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across its applications. Prior to IBM, he was president of AOL and global CEO of Razorfish.\n\nAt Horizon, Lord will oversee the development and alignment of the agency\u2019s various businesses, including its newly instituted advertising offering, One Horizon, in addition to full-service agency Horizon Next, multicultural agency 305 and more.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLord comes to Horizon at a pivotal time for both the agency and industry at large. Horizon is the world\u2019s largest independent media agency and has recently expanded into new areas, including launching a full-service creative offering just weeks ago. Agencies are also tasked with mastering technology where Lord brings a wealth of experience, such as implementing AI.\n\n\u201c[Bob\u2019s] accomplishments across technology, innovation, and business transformation make him the ideal leader to drive Horizon Holdings forward,\u201d said Horizon CEO Koenigsberg in a statement. \u201dI look forward to working with him to ensure we remain agile, forward-thinking, and deeply attuned to the voice of our clients, redefining what it means to be an independent, tech-centered, and people-first organization.\u201d\n\nThe agency space is set for massive disruption in the wake of Omnicom\u2019s proposed acquisition of Interpublic Group for $13 billion. The joining of two giants is likely to reshape the landscape for smaller networks and independents. Some could go on merger and acquisition sprees to better compete while clients may look to more modestly sized shops as they demand simplicity.\n\nHorizon could stand to gain from the Omnicom and IPG agreement, which is expected to close in the second half of the year. Having someone with Lord\u2019s marketing and technology bona fides is likely to be beneficial as things start to shake out.\n\nLord, a 30-year industry veteran, is tasked with driving innovation for Horizon in addition to overseeing its portfolio and developing businesses across each of its offices. The executive will also handle international strategy. Other agencies under Horizon\u2019s portfolio include sports and experiential agency HS&E, social-led content shop Blue Hour Studios, commerce agency Night Market and business-to-business practice Green Thread.\n\nBefore joining Horizon, Lord stepped away from the marketing and media landscape to take on leadership roles in the technology space. As chief digital officer at IBM, he helped spearhead tasks around AI, altered the company\u2019s go-to-market strategy and divested core units, including The Weather Company, to better align with IBM\u2019s business strategy.\n\nPrior to his time at IBM, Lord was president of AOL, where he led the development of its programmatic media platform.

            "content": "The AI Skills You'll Need for 2025: IBM SkillsBuild Education Forecast\n\n01/06/2025 - 09:35 AM\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 6, 2025 / IBM\n\nBy Justina Nixon-Saintil, VP and Chief Impact Officer, IBM Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n2024 was a remarkable year for the growth of AI and its impact on everything from work to education and even our personal lives. In my role leading IBM's social impact programs around the world, I have the opportunity to speak with education leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. In these conversations, I continue to hear that AI is transforming industries across communities.\n\nMost recently, I spoke with leaders across art, beauty, culture, fashion and media to learn how AI is already transforming their industries. My team at IBM has been very focused on how we use AI to support our communities effectively. At the same time, we are also committed to upskilling and reskilling learners, wherever they are on their AI journey. But how are professionals across other fields approaching this new technology? There's an exciting groundswell of creators exploring how they can use AI, from testing new applications for their work to automating the administrative tasks that impede their creative process. I've included some of their insights for you to reflect upon. It's clear that the human element remains core to their work. At the same time, their stories provide a glimpse into how AI is beginning to free up their time, helping them focus on what they do best.\n\nThis trend is common across industries. A new report from IBM reveals that 87% of executives expect jobs to be augmented rather than replaced by generative AI. As for the human element, the challenge today is that about half ( 47% ) of executives say their people lack the knowledge and skills to effectively implement and scale AI across the enterprise. The answer is that we need to invest in education and upskilling to fully reap the benefits of AI. People are crucial to this effort.\n\nWith that in mind, here are IBM's three predictions for education in 2025, and the skills we need to build now to prepare.\n\n1. AI ethics skills will be key\n\nIn education, we expect the start of a shift from traditional AI tools to AI agents. At the same time, the mainstream use of AI technology with ChatGPT and OpenAI has increased the potential risk of shadow AI. These two phenomena highlight the importance of accountability, data and IT policies, along with the control of autonomous systems. This is particularly crucial for education providers, because we think there will be greater attention paid to the AI guardrails and processes. To be prepared, educators, students and decision makers at all levels need to be upskilled in AI, with a focus on AI ethics and data management.\n\nDuring our recent conversation, Miles Hicks, Brand Marketing and Storytelling for the Brooklyn Museum said, \"We want to find ways to apply AI with integrity, so we can feel good about the work that is being produced. Critical thinking is key. We live in a world with information overload and learning how to become discerning is one of the most important lessons as a professional.\"\n\nI totally agree, and IBM SkillsBuild offers a course at no cost to help you build these skills: help you build these skills:\n\n(1 hour 45 minutes): In this course, you'll explore the five pillars of AI ethics-fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency and privacy-through real-world examples, learning their importance in creating trustworthy AI systems.\n\n2. Lifelong learning will be the new normal\n\nThis may not be a radical prediction, but I think it's a crucial and often-overlooked component of how we must approach education and upskilling. The marketplace is going to change quickly over the coming years, and the demand for individuals prepared to take on future jobs will increase. Employees who have been trained as individual contributors may soon become managers of AI agents, which would require new AI skills. The growth of AI agents, the future use of quantum computing and the increase in cyberthreats will make this transformation pervasive. Upskilling won't end with AI. The immediate need is for AI skills, but there will soon be a growing demand for quantum skills, alongside an enduring demand for cybersecurity skills. Lifelong learning is essential for people who want to remain competitive in the job market.\n\nKatini Yamaoka, Founder and CEO of Katina Skin, highlighted the need for AI skills in her beauty company: \"Once you start a business, you need to build your customer base and you really need to dive deep to figure out who they are, what are their concerns, and what are they looking for. AI has been incredible for uncovering that.\"\n\nNo matter where you are in your career journey-whether you want to start a business or augment your work-you need AI today. I recently spoke with Jamauri Bynum-Bridgewater, a newly graduated student who credits his role at a Fortune 500 company to the AI digital credentials he earned through IBM SkillsBuild. Examples such as these are why IBM is committed to training 2 million learners in AI by 2026. A couple of our most popular courses are a great place to begin:\n\nIntroduction to artificial intelligence (1 hour 15 minutes): In under a century, AI has transformed data analysis and autonomous learning. This course covers its history and role in unlocking insights from unstructured data.\n\nMastering the art of prompt writing (1 hour): This hands-on course teaches how to write effective prompts for AI language models, such as creating prompts for travel itineraries and custom music playlists.\n\n3. AI will be infused into education platforms\n\nAI and automation are poised to become a competitive advantage for education platforms and systems. I think we're going to start seeing an increased use of AI across learning platforms, offering simplified explanations of topics and personalized learning pathways. We're already putting AI to work to enhance IBM SkillsBuild for our learners. For example, we've used AI to analyze feedback from more than 60,000 learners in 47 languages, which has helped us simplify processes such as online-learning registration. There are so many applications for AI in the education system, and we can really make a difference if we share our knowledge as we apply the technology to each new area.\n\nBreanna Young, Senior Product Designer at Hearst said, \"It's up to us to share knowledge with one another across our communities as we explore uses of AI.\"\n\nI agree that this is a vital edict, and I will continue to share my knowledge as we further integrate AI into the IBM SkillsBuild online platform. If you'd like to learn more about how AI can enhance education offerings, I'd recommend this course:\n\nArtificial intelligence in practice (40 minutes): From communicating with chatbots to piloting self-driving cars and addressing complex global problems, AI is solving problems everywhere.\n\nStart learning today\n\nWe need to invest in our own skills to make the most of what AI has to offer. As Katini noted in our conversation, \"AI is here to enhance our lives, but we still have to do the groundwork and build the foundation.\"\n\nThere's no better time to start than now. Miles summed it up nicely: \"Be a student. Be open to lifelong learning. We shouldn't be too afraid or too prideful to take a one-hour course.\"\n\nWith that in mind, the courses I've suggested are each two hours or less in duration and are designed for individuals at all experience levels. Explore these courses to help build the skills needed to succeed in an AI-driven world.\n\nExplore IBM SkillsBuild to learn more about the additional AI courses we offer\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: IBM\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: IBM",

            "content": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nKendra DeKeyrel is a vice president in IBM\u2019s sustainability software division, specializing in solutions that drive efficiency, reduce environmental impact and create value for organizations around the globe. Opinions are the author\u2019s own.\n\nKendra DeKeyrel is a VP in IBM\u2019s sustainability software division Permission granted by IBM\n\n\u201cSustainability\u201d has different definitions depending on the industry context. In the technology sector, sustainability may refer to building more efficient software. In the financial sector, it may mean routing capital to more environmentally friendly investments.\n\nIn manufacturing, sustainability is closely linked to asset performance, resource efficiency and waste management: Is a production line machine consuming more resources than necessary? At what point does an aging assembly line robot turn from asset to liability?\n\nSome level of inefficiency is inevitable in manufacturing. And while no production plant is perfect, improvement is possible by continuously looking to reduce waste. Doing so proactively and at scale can translate into operational excellence and big sustainability gains.\n\nConfronting the issue does not have to require a pricey investment in entirely new assets. Increasingly, manufacturers are pursuing these gains through asset lifecycle management. ALM is a strategy for monitoring and managing manufacturing assets across their entire lifespan and acting on data-driven insights along the way. ALM represents the integration of various processes and technology: routine inspections, a computerized maintenance management system, the wide usage of IoT devices and more.\n\nAI technology has been evolving in parallel with ALM, and some manufacturers are combining the two. From computer vision to machine learning to generative AI, the technology can have an outsized impact on sustainability when coupled with ALM and deployed across industrial workspaces.\n\nMany business leaders are already aware of AI\u2019s benefits for sustainability and are bullish about its adoption: Recent IBM research revealed that 90% of executives believe AI can positively influence their sustainability goals.\n\nHowever, that ambition doesn\u2019t translate into action: The same research found that fewer than half of organizations are actually leveraging AI for sustainability efforts. Going forward, the most successful manufacturers will be those who act on their AI ambitions and couple the technology with ALM. Here are three ways how.\n\nComputer vision and inspections\n\nDigital technology has made the inspection process more precise and eliminated much of the drudgery. Now, recent advances are compounding these benefits. Computer vision is one of those advances.\n\nComputer vision, a branch of AI, enables machines to interpret objects and is increasingly used in manufacturing. Manufacturers integrate it into their ALM strategies to detect defects and monitor production. Tools like drones, stationary cameras and smartphones equipped with this technology provide real-time monitoring of assets and facilities, enhancing efficiency and identifying issues promptly.\n\nThis enables predictive maintenance, another branch of AI, to glean insights from a wide array of sensors and other devices. For example, predictive maintenance leverages both real-time data on an asset\u2019s current condition and historical performance data to provide technicians with advanced warning of potential issues, helping to identify deteriorating health before failure occurs.\n\nThe technician can then intervene before it fails and requires a pricey repair bill. This approach allowed IBM and engineering firm Novate Solutions to reduce waste at plants by 15% and improve product quality by 30%. It also enabled IBM and Swedish brewing giant Spendrups Bryggeri to enhance their sprawling maintenance operations.\n\nGenerative AI and work order management\n\nWork order management is another part of ALM that has evolved significantly. In most manufacturing settings, piles of paperwork and the clattering of clipboards have been replaced by more effective digital solutions. Still, maintenance managers continue to struggle with assigning proper failure codes and identifying the root cause of issues.\n\nGenerative AI is helping solve those issues. Systems infused with generative AI can help with \u201cnext action\u201d workflows, creating a failure code recommendation for work orders along with a related predictive confidence score. For example, it may recommend it is 80% confident that an asset failure is related to machine plugging or choking.\n\nTo train these AI systems, users only need to label a handful of examples, replacing the tedious task of combing through data sets related to code classifications. This \u201csmall data\u201d approach means the technology is more accessible and technicians can troubleshoot problems much more quickly.\n\nGenerative AI has applications beyond work orders, too. Manufacturers are using the technology to summarize documents and more quickly design and prototype applications.\n\nAI and energy management\n\nEnergy management is also a key part of ALM, ensuring assets are not consuming more energy than they require, driving efficiency down and costs up. Machine learning AI and automation systems can monitor an asset\u2019s energy usage in real time and around the clock, spotting inefficiencies and then proactively recommending changes to reduce usage and costs.\n\nThis data-rich approach can be a relief for manufacturers who historically have struggled to quantify sustainability initiatives. Indeed, IBM research reveals that half of business leaders struggle to measure sustainability KPIs.\n\nThere is an added benefit of using AI for energy management: It can assist with corporate sustainability rules and regulations. AI for energy management allows manufacturers to carefully track emissions, ensure they meet requirements and better pursue decarbonization.\n\nLooking ahead: agentic AI\n\nGenerative AI technology is advancing rapidly, creating even more opportunities for manufacturers to boost sustainability. Evolving agentic workflows level up generative AI from delivering insights to autonomously performing and solving complex tasks set by humans.\n\nAI agents\u2019 ability to interact with external environments enhances productivity and frees up manufacturing staff for more critical and strategic work.\n\nAI is a critical tool throughout manufacturers\u2019 ALM process, from asset planning and deployment to asset operation, optimization and disposal. In addition to the above use cases, manufactures can also leverage AI to create \u201cdigital twins\u201d of factories and their production lines, simulating countless scenarios. They can also pair AI with robotics and edge computing \u2014 like IBM and Boston Dynamics have \u2014 to create roving and artificially-intelligent inspectors.\n\nAI is not a panacea, of course. The technology \u2014 like any other \u2014 has challenges. Without the right volume and quality of data, AI outputs suffer. And a shortage of AI-skilled professionals means manufacturers do not always have access to the right talent.\n\nThese are obstacles to overcome, however, not reasons to eschew AI. Without a doubt, the most successful manufactures this decade will integrate AI widely into their ALM processes.",

            "content": "Opinion The resurfacing of a 1995 Usenet post earlier this month prompted The Reg FOSS desk to re-examine a pivotal operating system flop \u2026 and its long-term consequences.\n\nA 1995 Usenet post from Gordon Letwin, Microsoft's lead architect on the OS/2 project, has been rediscovered. To modern eyes, it looks like an email, but it wasn't. Usenet was the original social network and this was a public post. In case you don't recognize Letwin's name, he was one of the founding staff members of Microsoft \u2013 he's in the famous 1978 Albuquerque photo. He literally wrote the book on OS/2, that book being Inside OS/2.\n\nLetwin's 1995 post says:\n\nOriginally I'd planned on posting this on Aug 24, but real life events are foreshadowing things so I'll post a bit early.\n\nWhy not the August 24? Because August 24, 1995, was the day that Microsoft launched Windows 95. What's interesting about the post is that it seems to show that even by 1995 \u2013 just before what would prove to be Microsoft's most successful OS launch ever \u2013 Microsoft's OS/2 head honcho still hadn't put his finger on precisely why it flopped.\n\nArguably the most important changes in software and hardware that shaped the modern computing gathered force in the 1980s. Industry-standard desktop computers went from eight-bit machines to 16-bit, and then to 32-bit, all over the space of just ten years. This set the stage for the developments of the 1990s that put us where we are today, in a world of multicore 64-bit machines running mainly just two extended families of operating systems \u2013 Windows NT and Unix \u2013 which take tens of gigabytes and are still growing.\n\nWindows 95 was a big launch, but its success wasn't a huge surprise. Beta versions had been circulating for over a year. It's fair to say that by 1995, OS/2 was dead software walking. That's not a big revelation; it is the central theme of Letwin's post. Almost exactly a year later, on September 25, 1996, the last ever major version of OS/2, Warp 4, was released.\n\nFor context, by 1995 everyone knew that Windows 95 was going to be a big deal, and that it was all over for OS/2 bar the shouting. A keen user of OS/2 2.0, this vulture moved his home PC to Windows 95 while it was still in beta. The UI was far superior, more hardware worked, and Doom ran much better.\n\nBut does Letwin's post miss the real point?\n\nNo, he says:\n\nWhat was OS/2's problem? Why was it doomed? Because it's [sic] main attraction was as an engine to run MS-Windows applications.\n\nThat, we submit, is wrong on multiple levels (not just the grocer's apostrophe). Only 32-bit OS/2 \u2013 that's OS/2 2.0 and its successors \u2013 could run Windows apps. That isn't why it was doomed. It's a red herring. It's true, but it was a symptom of the decline, not a cause of it. The lack of native apps was a sure sign that OS/2 had already flopped.\n\n(As an aside, OS/2 1.x did have big-name native apps. For instance, the market leaders, Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, both appeared on OS/2 before Windows. Lotus 1-2-3/G on OS/2 predated 1-2-3/W for Windows. There was a Wordperfect for OS/2 before the first Windows version.)\n\nYou don't need a deep knowledge of the history to work out why this was an effect, not a cause. The logic is inexorable. Let's step back through the reasoning, chronologically.\n\nNot many high-profile native applications were developed for 32-bit OS/2, because it could run Windows 3.x apps.\n\nThis means all the commercially important apps were already Windows apps.\n\nWhy? Because Windows was already dominant.\n\nWhen OS/2 2.0 launched in April 1992, a good enough and commercially successful version of Windows already dominated the market. That was Windows 3.0, launched in May 1990.\n\nIn other words, OS/2 2.0 trailed Windows 3.0 by nearly two years. When OS/2 finally went 32-bit, as a platform it had already lost the battle. The lack of native apps was not the reason it lost; the lack of native apps was proof that Windows 3 had already won.\n\nHow did Windows 3 win? Because OS/2 1.x had already flopped.\n\nThat's the real crux, but Letwin buries it and almost dismisses it. The really important bit is not about Windows applications. The real question is how and why Windows 3 was able to gain that dominance, why it's the platform that other companies wrote the apps for.\n\nLetwin mentions this, but he misses the significance. It's this part:\n\nThe miscalculation came about with the 386 coming out sooner than we expected ... When the 386 did come out earlier than expected and we saw what was happening, Microsoft wanted to abandon OS/2 1.0 before it was released and work on a 386-only version, one that would be able to emulate more than one DOS box and do a better job at that.\n\nThat's absolutely right. But Letwin still misses the key element of the story.\n\nAn 80386-specific OS/2 1 would have been the right thing to do. Microsoft jointly announced OS/2 1.0 in April 1987, a year and a half after Intel launched the 80386 in October 1985. OS/2 1.0 was so unfinished it didn't even have a graphical desktop yet. It was a text-mode, command-line-only OS, it cost $325 and required 2 MB of RAM.\n\nIf that text-only OS/2 1.0 had been able to multitask DOS apps, it would have been an attractive option. DOS multitasking is all that Quarterdeck's DESQview could do, for instance \u2013 and it cost $399.\n\nBut no, as Letwin spells out, OS/2 1.x was limited to the 16-bit 80286:\n\nBut, as you'll remember, Compaq was the first to have a 386 box; IBM was slow to follow suit. IBM was strong in 286's and weak in 386's, so it was strongly opposed to dropping the 286 in favor of leapfrogging to the 386 and they insisted that we stay the course for the 286.\n\nWhat he wrote was true, but we think it was not the core reason for IBM's intransigence.\n\nYes, Compaq shipped a 386 first, the Compaq Deskpro 386, whose importance we've looked at before. Even so, IBM was in the market early and strongly with 386 machines.\n\nThe IBM PS/2 Model 80 was a best-seller. As a callow 20-year-old, this vulture set up quite a few SCO Xenix systems on Model 80 machines. Suffice to say, the author still owns one today.\n\nCompaq was first. The Deskpro 386 launched in September 1986, but it was crippled by a 16-bit ISA expansion bus \u2013 only its proprietary memory card slot was 32-bit, and $6,499 ($18,718 today) is a lot of money for a very limited machine.\n\nIBM launched the PS/2 lineup in April 1987, with the Model 80 (386) following in July. Unlike the Compaq, IBM's 386 machines had a full 32-bit expansion bus and could drive 32-bit peripherals.\n\nNobody could design and build a superior machine in less than a year; it would take more than 11 months to design, implement, and manufacture the first fully 32-bit PC with a wholly new expansion architecture.\n\nYes, IBM was slower to market and that hurt it, but the Model 80 (and the desktop Model 70, the fastest x86 PC in the world, bar none) was a stunning kit for the time, and they sold well despite being the cost of a good sports car.\n\nIBM was slow to market, but it wasn't that slow. By comparison, Compaq rushed the Deskpro 386 out, and it showed.\n\nThe key point was not the timing, as Letwin alleges. Yes, one of the original clone vendors rushed out an impressive but flawed product; Compaq got there first, and that was embarrassing.\n\nBut it was just a minor embarrassment. The real deal was this.\n\nIBM made a promise, and IBM kept its promises. It shipped the PS/2 range with 286s front and center, promising OS/2 compatibility to its customers \u2013 a promise IBM wouldn't break. So it vetoed Microsoft's plan of pivoting the new OS to the 386, even if that plan was solid and motivated by the correct reasoning.\n\nIf OS/2 1.0 had been an 80386 OS, and had been able to multitask DOS apps, we think it would have been a big hit. On the back of that hypothetical success, IBM could have individually couriered a replacement 80386 \"planar\" (\"motherboard\" to lesser vendors) to every customer who bought an 80286 PS/2 and wanted OS/2. IBM would still have made more money in the long run.\n\nIn his early 20s, this reporter worked on lots of 286 PS/2s and the bulk of owners had never heard of OS/2 and didn't care. IBM sold the machines as high-quality DOS computers, and that's all most customers wanted.\n\nBut backtracking on its promise that all PS/2 machines would run OS/2 would mean IBM admitted that it had made a mistake. That could not be. IBM did not make mistakes.\n\nAs an example, the PS/2 computers did not have reset buttons, because a reset button is how you reboot a computer that's locked up so hard that Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work. A reset button would mean acknowledging IBM computers crashed, and that was unacceptable. Instead, you had to waste a minute or two power-cycling the things. We did that a lot.\n\nEven nearly a decade after OS/2 flopped, its lead architect, Gordon Letwin, could not admit when and why it flopped. He did know. As he says, OS/2's initial 1980s versions were 16-bit products, at IBM's insistence.\n\nThat is when the war was lost. That is when OS/2 flopped. Because its initial versions were even more crippled than the Deskpro 386. The Deskpro worked; it was just slow. OS/2's fate was already sealed long before in the 1980s, because the 16-bit versions were no better at running DOS apps than DOS itself.\n\nBecause OS/2 1.x flopped, Microsoft launched a product that fixed the key weakness of OS/2 1.x. That product was Windows 3, which worked perfectly acceptably on 286 machines, but if you ran the same installed copy on a 32-bit 386 PC, it worked better. Windows 3.0 could use the more sophisticated hardware of a 386 to give better multitasking of the market-dominating DOS apps.\n\nOS/2 1.x ran fine on a 386, but it ran exactly the same as it did on a 286. You got no additional benefit from your 32-bit hardware. But Windows 3.0 did. You got memory protection and virtual memory, as well as a usable GUI.\n\nWindows 3 beat OS/2 because IBM insisted that OS/2 ran on the 80286, which crippled the new OS. IBM's determination to serve its customers with 80286 PS/2s, and keep a promise, resulted in OS/2 being a failure. That is what allowed Windows to gain the upper hand.\n\nIn other words, the really important bit of Letwin's post isn't what its author thought it was. IBM's poor planning shaped the PC industry of the 1990s more than Microsoft's successes.\n\nWindows 3.0 wasn't great, but it was good enough. It reversed people's perception of Windows after the failures of Windows 1 and Windows 2. Windows 3 achieved what OS/2 had intended to do. It transformed IBM PC compatibles from single-tasking text-only computers into graphical computers, with poor but just about usable multitasking.\n\nIBM and Microsoft divorced to go separate ways. IBM kept the planned future 32-bit OS/2 for 386 chips, which was surprisingly close to ready by 1990. Microsoft kept the planned CPU-independent, portable OS/2, known as OS/2 3 but internally nicknamed OS/2 NT after the N-Ten chip, which became the Intel i860 RISC processor.\n\nSoon after Windows 3.0 turned out to be a hit, OS/2 NT was rebranded as Windows NT. Even the most ardent Linux enthusiast must concede that Windows NT did quite well over three decades.\n\nOS/2 flopped because the company paying for the work, IBM, designed it for machines that it had already sold. It did not want to let existing customers down.\n\nEven at the time, by its own admission, Microsoft realized that aiming its new OS at emerging CPU technology made more sense.\n\nSo with Microsoft's next OS, Windows NT, that's what it did. It ended up eventually dominating the industry because it aimed at future hardware: it was designed to run on the i860, specifically the Dazzle motherboard, then the MIPS R3000, as well as x86 machines.\n\nOS/2 2.0 was relatively tiny. In 1992, it needed just 4 MB RAM and 60 MB disk. A year later, at release in 1993, Windows NT 3.1 needed four times as much memory as well as more disk space. As someone who deployed it in production, it wanted considerably more to run well.\n\nThe result? Decades of growth in program size, because the dogma is focus on the future, designing for ever-more-powerful hardware and higher-spec computers. Even now, Windows 11 won't run on a perfectly serviceable kit.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Microsoft plotted a course. By 1995, the signs were there that it had forgotten exactly why. \u00ae",

            "content": "If 2024 was the year companies gained some clarity on future office needs, 2025 is expected to be the year they start calling workers back to fill them.\n\nFrom corporate giants to smaller professional services firms, employers across the country are stepping up their in-person requirements in an attempt to move past the pandemic-related shift toward increased flexible work arrangements. Office market stakeholders point to the escalated mandates, many of which take effect in 2025, as a signal that demand for office space will be on the rebound after years of depressed leasing activity.\n\nAcross the United States, the debate over flexible work policies has settled somewhat since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains a sticking point between employers and their workers as well as the broader office market. Hybrid work mandates have largely been attributed to contributing to the national vacancy rate rising to a record high of about 14%, according to CoStar data.\n\nUp until now, office attendance has largely flatlined, and employees are spending about 60% of their working days in a corporate office, a marginal increase compared to this time last year, according to Stanford University's Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes.\n\nSome of the country's largest landlords say the stricter in-office mandates are enough to bolster growing optimism that the demand for space will climb as corporate heavyweights push to revert back to their pre-pandemic workweek schedules. The number of CEOs who expected their companies to adopt a full return to a five-day workweek climbed to about 85% from the 64% reported last year, according to a recent KPMG survey.\n\n\"This is a sign of things to come,\" Kilroy Realty CEO Angela Aman recently told analysts. \"We're seeing tenants who had reduced space or were actively planning on reducing space in 2025, come back and sort of begin conversations with us because they believe they've overshot those reductions.\"\n\nEven so, more workers regularly commuting to an office may take some time to result in any corresponding spike in demand that landlords and developers have been hopeful about.\n\n\"For the most part, we haven't seen return-to-office mandates translate in to leasing demand,\" said Phil Mobley, CoStar's national director of office analytics. \"There may be fewer move-outs now, but there hasn't been much of an increase in leasing activity to drive any meaningful growth. The sheer force of math suggests that we\u2019re going to be looking at high vacancy for a long time, and it will probably keep rising over the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nHere are some of the largest companies that will pave the way in 2025 for other office tenants to follow their lead in calling more employees back to physical office space.\n\nAmazon\n\nHeadquarters: Seattle\n\nIn-person policy: The retail giant plans to effectively eliminate its remote-work in 2025 when it begins demanding all corporate workers to return to an office for five days a week starting in January, though it has postponed that requirement for some employees in cities where Amazon says it doesn't yet have enough space. The company had been operating on a hybrid policy that asked employees to be in person at least three days per week.\n\nWho it affects: Roughly 350,000 corporate employees.\n\nWhat they say: \"We've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said of the decision behind adopting the upcoming mandate. \"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant.\"\n\nSouthwest\n\nHeadquarters: Dallas\n\nIn-person policy: Starting Jan. 6, the air carrier is requiring employees to report to its headquarters at least four, if not five, days per week. The escalated policy sheds the company\u2019s pandemic-era flexibility that allowed workers to commute about three days a week.\n\nWho it affects: Corporate employees\n\nWhat they say: \u201cCorporate campus employees who are hybrid will transition to working onsite Monday through Thursday and Friday as needed,\" said Lynn Lunsford, Southwest's senior communications adviser. \"We are working to enhance employee engagement while ensuring we have a vibrant corporate campus that fosters collaboration and promotes Southwest's culture.\"\n\nStarbucks\n\nHeadquarters: Seattle\n\nIn-person policy: The coffee conglomerate plans to ramp up enforcement of its three-day office policy for corporate employees beginning Jan. 1. The company recently issued a warning to its workforce that those who don't meet that requirement will risk possible termination.\n\nWho it affects: The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate Starbucks employees, a small fraction of the company's roughly 380,000-person global workforce, much of which is based in retail outposts.\n\nWhat they say: \u201cWe are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,\u201d a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement to CoStar News.\n\nSalesforce\n\nHeadquarters: San Francisco\n\nIn-person policy: The company recently began requiring most of its employees to work from an office four to five days a week. It's a stark reversal for the company, one of the nation's first to implement a pandemic-induced flexible work policy, with CEO Marc Benioff previously saying \u201coffice mandates are never going to work.\u201d\n\nWho it affects: Employees across the company's sales, workplace services, data center engineering and other departments are beholden to the escalated mandate.\n\nWhat they say: \u201cSalesforce has always been a hybrid work company,\u201d a spokesperson said in the statement. \u201cOur guidelines focus on in-person connection, while also recognizing the value of working away from the office.\u201d\n\nIBM\n\nHeadquarters: Armonk, New York\n\nIn-person policy: IBM demands all managerial roles to report to an office at least three days a week, a mandate measured by badging data. Employees that previously worked remotely and lived more than 50 miles from an IBM office or client location were required to relocate.\n\nWho it affects: All executive and manager-level positions.\n\nWhat they say: The company is \"focused on providing a work environment that balances flexibility with the face-to-face interactions,\" a spokesperson told CoStar News. \"Consistent with that approach, we're requiring executives and people managers in the United States to be in the office at least three days per week.\"\n\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n\nHeadquarters: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn-person policy: Metro employees will no longer be able to work from home starting February 2025, the transportation agency told workers earlier this month. The escalated mandate came several days after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's talk with members of Congress, telling them she was eager to work together to bring federal workers back to the office, a longstanding goal among local officials as they look to aid the city's post-pandemic recovery efforts.\n\nWho it affects: The new mandate applies to the agency's entire workforce, which includes about 13,000 employees. Many of them have been working on site each day, but now remaining employees and directors will return to the office five days a week.\n\nWhat they say: \"We are an essential service to the region,\" Metro told employees in a recent memo. \"The vast majority of our employees work on site every day, and we remain committed to fostering a unified culture where every team member feels valued and supported. As we prepare for 2025, which promises to be a pivotal year for Metro to support large-scale regional events, leadership is focusing on enhancing collaboration and strengthening our efforts to work as one Metro.\"\n\nDell\n\nHeadquarters: Round Rock, Texas\n\nIn-person policy: The tech company now requires its sales staff to return to the office starting five days a week, ditching an earlier policy that allowed its U.S. employees to pick between working remotely or following a hybrid schedule that let them commute at least three days per week. The new mandate is tracked by security badge swipes.\n\nWho it affects: The company's global sales team with the exception of fully remote positions.\n\nWhat they say: \"The sales floor is a unique environment that combined high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,\" Bill Scannell, Dell's president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, its global president of sales told employees in a recent memo. \"To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.\"\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nHeadquarters: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn-person policy: Starting next year, the daily news organization will ramp up its in-person mandate by requiring its workforce to commute to the office Monday through Friday, effectively terminating the remote and hybrid policy it adopted in the early weeks of the pandemic.\n\nWho it affects: Post managers were told they will have to come back starting in early February, with the rest of the newsroom's roles returning in June.\n\nWhat they say: \"I want that great office energy for us every day,\" Publisher Will Lewis wrote in a recent memo viewed by CoStar News. \"You know how much we all must do to improve our company, and I do not believe we can do that successfully via Zoom. We are really good when we are working together in person.\"",

Now, a new term, \"agentic AI,\" is emerging as the next major innovation.\n\nAccording to Steve Astorino, IBM's general manager of product development, data, AI and sustainability and the Canadian lab director, agentic AI is poised to redefine industries very quickly. He described agentic AI as the evolution of Gen AI, capable of autonomously handling complex, multistep tasks.\n\n\u201cIBM has been developing generative AI for a long time, at least five or six years, but we\u2019ve prioritized safety and trust before rushing it to market,\u201d said Astorino. \u201cOur AI ethics board ensures that every solution we deliver is grounded in clean, reliable data and strong governance.\u201d\n\nUnlike traditional AI, agentic AI systems can autonomously design workflows, make decisions and interact with external environments. These systems combine the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) with the precision of traditional programming, offering transformative opportunities for efficiency and productivity.\n\nAstorino pointed to IBM\u2019s AI-powered HR tools as a current example of this transformation. These systems already handle repetitive tasks like processing time-off requests and onboarding employees.\n\n\u201cBy automating these processes, HR professionals can focus on culture building, talent development and strategic initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nIBM\u2019s AskHR solution has automated over 80 HR functions, saving time while offering personalized support for employees and managers.\n\nAgentic AI\u2019s potential extends well beyond HR, such as in health care, Astorino explains \u2014 AI agents could manage treatment schedules and routine administrative tasks, enabling medical professionals to focus on patient care.\n\nAcross industries like retail and logistics, agentic AI is driving operational efficiency, enhancing decision-making and delivering exceptional customer experiences.\n\nAs IBM continues to expand its operations in Markham, the company is actively hiring for roles in AI, data, automation, infrastructure, technology, UX design, consulting and software engineering.\n\nFor those interested in joining IBM\u2019s team, opportunities are available on the IBM Careers page at ibm.com/careers.\n\nScarlett Liu is a federally funded Local Journalism Initiative Reporter at Markham Economist & Sun.",

Around 51% of businesses using open-source tools report positive returns, compared to 41% of those relying on other types of software.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are concentrating on productivity gains rather than traditional ROI measures,\u201d Maribel Lopez from Lopez Research, said in a media release. \u201cThey see the value in defining clear goals and using open-source ecosystems to innovate and achieve results.\u201d\n\nIncreasing AI spending\n\nThe study predicts more spending on AI, with 62% of companies planning to invest more in 2025. Of these, 39% expect to raise their budgets by 25%-50%. Most plan to focus their spending on improving IT operations (63%), managing data quality (46%), and creating new products or services (41%).\n\nOnly 5% of respondents plan to reduce their AI budgets, showing strong confidence in AI\u2019s benefits.\n\n\u201cOpen-source tools are becoming a key part of companies\u2019 strategies to improve efficiency and drive innovation,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nWhy open source matters\n\nThe study highlights the growing importance of open-source tools in AI development. Nearly 60% of companies already use open-source platforms for their AI projects. By 2025, even more businesses are expected to adopt open-source tools, with 41% planning to rely on them more.\n\nAccording to the survey, open-source tools provide the flexibility and cost savings that traditional systems can\u2019t match.\n\nCompanies using open-source AI tools are also faster at moving from testing to full implementation. About 38% of these organizations plan to start more than 21 AI projects in 2025, compared to 26% of companies not using open-source tools.\n\nTracking success in AI\n\nMany companies are finding alternative ways to measure AI success. They focus on faster software development (25%), innovation (23%), and saving time (22%) over traditional financial metrics like cost savings, which only 15% of respondents prioritize.\n\nFor companies not yet seeing positive returns, most remain hopeful. The study found 92% expect to achieve financial benefits within three years.\n\nThe findings show that businesses are increasingly turning to open-source AI tools to innovate and improve their financial outcomes. As AI adoption grows, open source is likely to play an even bigger role in shaping the future of these technologies.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated Stories",

Now, a new term, \"agentic AI,\" is emerging as the next major innovation.\n\nAccording to Steve Astorino, IBM's general manager of product development, data, AI and sustainability and the Canadian lab director, agentic AI is poised to redefine industries very quickly. He described agentic AI as the evolution of Gen AI, capable of autonomously handling complex, multistep tasks.\n\n\u201cIBM has been developing generative AI for a long time, at least five or six years, but we\u2019ve prioritized safety and trust before rushing it to market,\u201d said Astorino. \u201cOur AI ethics board ensures that every solution we deliver is grounded in clean, reliable data and strong governance.\u201d\n\nUnlike traditional AI, agentic AI systems can autonomously design workflows, make decisions and interact with external environments. These systems combine the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) with the precision of traditional programming, offering transformative opportunities for efficiency and productivity.\n\nAstorino pointed to IBM\u2019s AI-powered HR tools as a current example of this transformation. These systems already handle repetitive tasks like processing time-off requests and onboarding employees.\n\n\u201cBy automating these processes, HR professionals can focus on culture building, talent development and strategic initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nIBM\u2019s AskHR solution has automated over 80 HR functions, saving time while offering personalized support for employees and managers.\n\nAgentic AI\u2019s potential extends well beyond HR, such as in health care, Astorino explains \u2014 AI agents could manage treatment schedules and routine administrative tasks, enabling medical professionals to focus on patient care.\n\nAcross industries like retail and logistics, agentic AI is driving operational efficiency, enhancing decision-making and delivering exceptional customer experiences.\n\nAs IBM continues to expand its operations in Markham, the company is actively hiring for roles in AI, data, automation, infrastructure, technology, UX design, consulting and software engineering.\n\nFor those interested in joining IBM\u2019s team, opportunities are available on the IBM Careers page at ibm.com/careers.\n\nScarlett Liu is a federally funded Local Journalism Initiative Reporter at Markham Economist & Sun",

            "content": "Consumers are tech-savvy trendsetters and brands need to keep up to stay relevant. Today, customers and shoppers are actively engaged with AI in their daily lives, from using AI-powered search engines to creating content with generative AI tools. In the 2024 IBM Institute for Business Value (IBM IBV) consumer research study, nearly two-thirds of consumers said they have used or want to try AI applications. This interest sets the stage for retail and consumer products companies to hasten integration of AI across their businesses while keeping an eye toward becoming AI-led brands\u2014leveraging the technology to reimagine operations, inspire loyalty, and expand the size of customers\u2019 wallets for long-term competitive advantage.\n\nOur latest survey of 1,500 global retail and consumer products executives finds organizations are accelerating their adoption. AI\u2014both traditional and generative\u2014has permeated all functions in the enterprise to some degree. From marketing and customer service, to supply chain and procurement, to finance and IT operations, AI use cases span brand-defining, business-enabling, and corporate operations. Looking ahead through 2025, most executives are thinking big, expecting AI to be used extensively across the business. Industry leaders also report AI spending is on the rise\u2014both within and outside of the IT budget, and they project that AI\u2019s contribution to revenue growth will increase 133% from 2023 to 2027.\n\nRetail and consumer products organizations are at a pivotal point in their AI journey. The question is: are they taking enough of the right steps to become AI-led brands, or are they just tacking on ad hoc AI solutions that deliver short-term gains? It\u2019s time to move beyond just productivity and efficiency and extend AI\u2019s power enterprise-wide to boost process effectiveness, spark new business models and ecosystems, and ignite engagement with innovative employee and customer experiences.\n\nOur research identified three factors that will help organizations make a fundamental change in their DNA, where AI emerges as the driving force behind every decision, innovation, and strategy.\n\nRecognizing the AI transformation is both a marathon and a sprint. Many organizations are in the early stages of AI adoption, integrating it within a single function. For example, 88% use AI to a moderate or significant extent in demand forecasting, 87% for HR help desks, 84% in creating and managing trade promotions, and 81% in inventory and order management. But over the next 12 months companies are keen on expanding to more sophisticated uses that require more complex system integrations and collaboration. For example, those leveraging AI to a significant extent for personalized responses and follow-up actions in customer service plan to increase their usage by 236% over the next 12 months.\n\nPriming the augmented workforce. Nearly all (96%) executives say their teams are using AI and gen AI to a moderate or significant extent at work. And across 13 functional areas from marketing and commerce to supply chain, HR and IT, executives plan to augment more than automate activities over the next 12 months. But they project only 31% of their workforce will need to reskill or develop new skills over the next 12 months, with this number climbing to just 45% in the next three years. When virtually everyone is using a new and powerful technology such as AI, then virtually everyone needs training to optimize the value and prevent brand-damaging results.\n\n\n\nRetail and consumer products executives know that automation has its place but see a future of augmentation.\n\n\n\nSafeguarding brand trust with AI governance. Trust has always been paramount to the industry, but AI adds risks that can impact both customer and partner relationships. Nine in 10 executives say misuse, such as creating misleading information, is their top worry associated with AI models, followed by privacy (85%), fairness and bias (80%), explainability (76%), and transparency (73%). Despite these concerns, organizations are struggling to enable the tools that can help them manage the AI governance policies they have put in place.\n\nDownload the report to explore these findings in more detail. Each topic includes a case study and an action guide of suggested steps to help companies accelerate their AI journey while building intelligent brands that will endure.",

The hope is to create a shovel-ready site for new industrial and manufacturing development.\n\n\u201cThis moment is a turning point. It is a declaration that we are ready to reimagine our spaces and reinvigorate our community,\u201d Broome County Executive Jason Garnar said. \u201cThe land where these buildings stand will soon hold the promise of economic development, modern facilities and a brighter future for generations to come.\u201d\n\nGarnar said the real estate firm Phoenix Investors, which owns the former IBM campus, has been trying to draw in new industrial tenants for years.\n\n\u201cBut it's hard to get people to look past all these old buildings and say, \u2018Hey, we've got a great opportunity to come here, but we have to do all this demolition,\u2019\u201d Garnar said. \u201cAnd I really think what you'll see is an incredible amount of interest and things actually happening here once the buildings come down.\u201d\n\nEndicott Mayor Nick Burlinggame said though the buildings have been dilapidated and vacant for years, watching them finally be demolished is emotional.\n\n\u201cFor so many, these buildings are more than just bricks and mortar. They represent decades of memories, progress and the dreams of countless families who built their lives here,\u201d Burlingame said. \u201cAnd while it is incredibly tough to see them go, we recognize that the time has come to embrace our collective future.\u201d\n\nIBM officially began operations in the area in the 1920s, with a thriving factory and research complex that employed generations of residents over decades. But in the late 1990s, the technology company began to pull out of Endicott.\n\nIn 2023, IBM shut down its last site in the village, leaving behind empty buildings and a complicated legacy of environmental contamination.\n\nPhoebe Taylor-Vuolo / WSKG News Elected officials gathered to watch the demolition project begin. Endicott Mayor Nick Burlinggame said seeing the buildings finally come down was emotional for many residents.\n\nEndicott sues IBM, alleging water contamination\n\nThe demolition project is not the only way Endicott is trying to move on from IBM. In early December, the village sued the company , accusing IBM of contaminating the local water supply through decades of \u201charmful practices at IBM\u2019s industrial facilities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that IBM improperly disposed of hazardous substances including PFAS and toxic chemicals, despite knowing that it could lead to groundwater contamination.\n\n\u201cOur water sources have been reduced to a single well due to contamination, which is unacceptable for our residents and businesses,\u201d Burlingame said in a statement. \u201cThis litigation seeks to ensure IBM takes responsibility for the resources and restorations to our water wells, which are necessary to protect public health.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, an IBM spokesperson called the lawsuit unjustified.\n\n\"IBM's more than 40 years of remediation activities in Endicott, in partnership with the village and state, demonstrates our longstanding commitment to the health and safety of the residents of the community,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cThere is no justification for the demands being made by the Village of Endicott in this matter, and IBM will vigorously defend itself.\u201d\n\nEfforts to address contamination from a toxic chemical spill at the IBM facilities, discovered in 1979, have lasted for decades, cost millions of dollars and include installing venting systems to prevent hazardous vapors from contaminating almost 500 buildings in the village.\n\nOfficials say this year\u2019s demolition project will not require as extensive cleanup or pose an environmental risk because the buildings were used as office space for the company, rather than industrial manufacturing.\n\nLocal elected officials say they\u2019re hoping once the buildings are demolished, the shovel-ready site will attract new industrial and manufacturing businesses and mark a new chapter in the village\u2019s history.",

The company\u2019s software business experienced stable growth, offsetting softness in its consulting business amid cautious enterprise spending on technology.\n\nIBM\u2019s stock made significant gains last year, driven by positive sentiment surrounding its AI portfolio, led by the Watsonx platform. After growing an impressive 48% through the year, the shares hit an all-time high of $238.04 in early December. The tech titan is a top dividend payer, offering a bigger-than-average yield of about 3%. The company has remained a favorite among income investors by consistently increasing its dividend payout for over three decades. Currently trading at a reasonable valuation, IBM has a strong upside for the long term.\n\nAI Power\n\nThe company looks poised to take advantage of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom through its well-structured AI solutions, outweighing weaknesses in some of the legacy businesses. The performance of Consulting, the second-largest business division, has been lackluster in recent quarters. Watsonx, the generative AI platform designed for enterprise clients, has elicited strong customer interest. It could become a key growth driver when the strong orders translate into revenues.\n\nAt the same time, after strengthening its cloud footprint by acquiring Red Hat a few years ago, the company has been aggressively expanding the hybrid-cloud business, giving competition to market leaders Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.\n\nSoftware Leads\n\nIn the third quarter, IBM\u2019s revenue increased modestly to $15.0 billion from $14.75 billion in the comparable period of 2023 but fell short of expectations. Software continued to be the main growth driver, with a 10% growth in that business more than offsetting weakness in the other areas. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $2.30 per share in Q3, higher than the $2.20 per share the company earned a year earlier. Interestingly, quarterly earnings have consistently beat estimates for about four years.\n\nOn an unadjusted basis, it was a net loss of $330 billion or $0.36 per share in the September quarter, compared to a profit of $1.70 billion or $1.84 per share in the prior year\u2019s quarter. The tech firm is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, January 29, after markets close. The management expects Q4 revenues to be consistent with third-quarter levels, on a constant currency basis.\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna commented on IBM\u2019s AI initiatives in a recent interaction with analysts, \u201cWe continue to gain traction in enterprise AI. Our book of business related to generative AI is now over $3 billion inception to date, up more than $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. The mix is roughly one-fifth software and four-fifth consulting signings. This performance has placed us in an early leadership position, which is crucial at the onset of any technology shift. The AI portfolio we have built is designed to give clients a comprehensive set of tools to deploy AI within their enterprise.\u201d\n\nThis week, IBM shares traded well above their 12-month average value.

How about some of 'em subsidies? READ MORE\n\nThe disputes and litigation between IBM and GlobalFoundries, formerly AMD's chipmaking unit which it spun out in 2009, were complex and spanned both state and federal courts.\n\nThe first main shot was fired by IBM in 2021, in a New York state court, over chip production (or non-production). The pair had signed a $1.5 billion deal in late 2014 where IBM transferred its semiconductor manufacturing business to GlobalFoundries. GF was supposed to take over the delivery of 14 nanometer technologies for IBM Power and z processors and deliver 10nm and smaller wafer-etching techniques as part of a ten-year agreement.\n\nAs our sister site The Next Platform mentioned at the time, there had been delays in getting 14nm chips out of the fabs. A spiking of the 10nm and then later the 7nm process, in August 2018, at least in Big Blue's estimation, had left it \"without a server roadmap, essentially.\" IBM asked the court for $2.5 billion in damages, which GF contested in its own complaint [PDF] was a baseless claim. GF claimed at the time that not only had it \"fulfilled its contractual obligations to IBM\" but that Big Blue's switch to Samsung as a supplier of 7nm processor chips for datacenters had actually saved IBM money and cut delivery times (though the judge wasn't convinced by the arguments).\n\nThe second key lawsuit, filed by GlobalFoundries in 2023 in a New York federal court, involved partnerships announced between Big Blue and Intel and Japan's Rapidus in 2021 and 2022 respectively. In the 2023 suit, the semiconductor maker accused IBM of unlawfully disclosing its confidential trade secrets and IP to its partners. It also alleged [PDF] in the complaint that IBM had been performing a \"systemic poaching of GF's most qualified semiconductor manufacturing engineers in order to generate even more licensing revenue by enabling other companies with GF IP.\"\n\nIBM's mainframe bubble bursts and growth stalls READ MORE\n\nIn their joint statement, the companies also expressed that the confidential settlement created \"satisfaction with the outcome\" from both parties. Some might suggest it makes sense to be cooperative and collaborative, especially as a potential outcome of the injunction GlobalFoundries had been asking for in the 2023 complaint may well have derailed Intel and Rapidus's roadmaps, as The Reg previously mentioned here. This is meaningful to IBM, which said last month it was \"moving closer to scaling out 2nm chip production\" in its partnership with Rapidus. GF had originally claimed in the now settled [PDF] federal lawsuit that when IBM planned to share the \"technology underlying the '2nm node chip'\" with Rapidus that this had allegedly included \"GF-Controlled Trade Secrets that were developed by GF and IBM.\"\n\nIBM and Rapidus presented their research on strategies for selective nanosheet layer reduction \u2013 which should help them more consistently construct chips with a 2nm process \u2013 at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting in San Francisco in December.\n\nGlobalFoundries, fined $500,000 last year for sanctions violations involving China, was awarded up to $1.5 billion in November last year under the US government's CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nAmerica's Commerce Department claimed GlobalFoundries was one of \"only four companies outside of China\" that it considered could provide foundry capabilities for current and mature process nodes on a necessary scale for the act's national goals, and is the only one of these headquartered in the United States. \u00ae",

The agreement included the transfer of IBM\u2019s manufacturing facilities in East Fishkill, New York, and Essex Junction, Vermont. Alongside the move, IBM agreed to pay GlobalFoundries to assume operational responsibility for the facilities. As part of the deal, GlobalFoundries committed to supplying IBM with advanced semiconductor chips for a decade to meet the latter\u2019s technological requirements.\n\nHowever, disputes arose over the execution of this agreement. In 2021, IBM filed a lawsuit, accusing GlobalFoundries of breaching its contractual obligations by failing to deliver 7-nanometre (7nm) semiconductor chips. IBM alleged that GlobalFoundries had abandoned the development of 7nm technology, which it described as critical for next-generation computing systems. The lawsuit argued that this breach caused substantial operational disruptions and financial harm, forcing IBM to secure alternative suppliers at higher costs.\n\nIBM also claimed that the failure undermined its research and development efforts, delaying the introduction of key products to the market. The company sought damages totalling $2.5bn to cover the financial and reputational impact caused by the alleged breach.\n\nIn response, GlobalFoundries initiated a countersuit in 2023, accusing IBM of improperly sharing trade secrets and intellectual property with competitors. The allegations stated that IBM disclosed proprietary technologies to companies such as Intel and Japan\u2019s Rapidus without authorisation. GlobalFoundries claimed these actions resulted in IBM gaining unfair advantages through licensing agreements and other collaborations.\n\nThe settlement, announced on Thursday, brings an end to these legal proceedings. The terms of the agreement are confidential, but both companies expressed satisfaction with the outcome.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has undergone significant changes during the course of this legal dispute. GlobalFoundries has become a key player in domestic chip manufacturing, receiving $1.5bn from the US government to expand production facilities in New York and Vermont. This funding is part of a broader initiative to boost domestic chip production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers.\n\nThe conclusion of the dispute also had immediate effects on the stock market. Shares of GlobalFoundries, traded on the NASDAQ, rose by 2.61% following the announcement. IBM, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, experienced a more modest 0.49% increase.\n\n\u201cResolving these disputes is a significant step forward for our companies and will allow us to both focus on future innovations that will benefit our organisations and customers,\u201d said IBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna.\n\nMeanwhile, IBM is facing another hurdle as the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated a Phase 1 investigation into its planned $6.4bn acquisition of HashiCorp, a multi-cloud infrastructure automation company. The investigation is focused on evaluating whether the proposed deal could lead to a substantial reduction in competition within the UK\u2019s cloud and IT markets. This scrutiny comes amid heightened attention to the cloud services sector in the UK. The CMA\u2019s inquiry follows recommendations from Ofcom, the UK\u2019s telecommunications regulator, which recently called for a more in-depth assessment of competition dynamics in the cloud industry.",

Jim Franco/Jim Franco/Times Union IBM CEO Arvind Krishna speaks as Albany Nanotech holds a news conference in Albany on Dec. 11, 2023. GlobalFoundries and IBM settled a long-running legal dispute this week, paving the way for the two companies to work together. Lori Van Buren/Times Union\n\nMALTA \u2014 GlobalFoundries and IBM have settled their long-simmering litigation related to a $1.5 billion manufacturing and technology transfer deal the two companies struck more than a decade ago.\n\nThe fallout from the 2015 transaction, which resulted in GlobalFoundries acquiring two of IBM\u2019s computer chip factories and a 10-year manufacturing agreement for GlobalFoundries to make IBM\u2019s chips, led to the two companies essentially severing ties and suing one another over various aspects of the deal that allegedly went wrong.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nChief among IBM\u2019s complaints was GlobalFoundries' decision several years later to abandon its plans to adopt extreme ultraviolet lithography needed to make the cutting-edge chips that IBM designs.\n\nGlobalFoundries pulled back from EUV as part of a strategy decision to focus its manufacturing on more prevalent chips used in automobiles, wireless infrastructure and other devices that do not require the ultra-processing speeds required for high-end chips.\n\nThe strategy, developed by GlobalFoundries' CEO Thomas Caulfield, helped to make GlobalFoundries profitable. EUV lithography machines, which print the atomic-level designs on silicon wafers to make chips, can cost anywhere between $250 million and $400 million each and require tens of millions of dollars in research costs to optimize.\n\nHowever, according to IBM, the move essentially prevented GlobalFoundries from making the high-end chips that IBM needed for its commercial computer servers that are used in data centers and supercomputers. IBM has traditionally assembled its servers in upstate Poughkeepsie.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nEUV lithography is the most expensive and important technology in chipmaking. Only one company in the world, ASML of the Netherlands, makes EUV machines, which use special mirrors and lasers to imprint microscopic designs for the most advanced chips. Under the deal, GlobalFoundries was supposed to move from making chips with 14 nanometer features to those with just 7 nanometer features. IBM has since moved on to designing chips with 2 nanometer features, the smallest in the industry.\n\nThe 2015 transaction, which was first announced in 2014, also included a 10-year contract for GlobalFoundries to make IBM\u2019s chips. As a result of GlobalFoundries' change in strategy, IBM ended up turning to Samsung to manufacture its chips. Samsung, based in South Korea, has its own foundry division that has invested heavily in EUV lithography machines.\n\nIBM sued GlobalFoundries in 2021, seeking $2.5 billion in a civil lawsuit filed in state court. GlobalFoundries also sued IBM.\n\nGlobalFoundries is headquartered in Saratoga County. Its Fab 8 manufacturing campus straddles the towns of Malta and Stillwater. About 3,000 people work at the site.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIBM is the largest tenant at Albany NanoTech and is based in Westchester County. IBM also has strong ties with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, where IBM has one of its quantum computers on campus.\n\nThe two companies, which are keeping the details of the legal settlement secret, said in a joint news release that they have \u201cresolved all litigation matters, inclusive of breach of contract, trade secrets and intellectual property claims between the two companies.\u201d\n\nJoint news releases are rare when two companies resolve lawsuits. The two companies also went out of their way to say that the two sides were both happy with the outcome.\n\n\u201cThis settlement marks the end of an ongoing legal dispute and allows the companies to explore new opportunities for collaboration in areas of mutual interest,\u201d the joint release states.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe details of the settlement are confidential and both parties have expressed satisfaction with the outcome.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached a positive resolution with IBM, and we look forward to new opportunities to build upon our long-standing partnership to further strengthen the semiconductor industry,\u201d Caulfield said in a prepared statement. Caulfield, like many top semiconductor industry executives, is also an IBM alum, having worked at the company previously.\n\n\u201cResolving these disputes is a significant step forward for our companies and will allow us to both focus on future innovations that will benefit our organizations and customers,\u201d IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe announcement comes as New York state is awash in billions of dollars in federal funding from the $52 billion CHIPS and Science Act for the computer chip industry that is designed to \u201creshore\u201d the U.S. chip industry\u2019s chip manufacturing capabilities.

            "content": "IBM is poised to benefit from healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and AI, which drive the Software and Consulting segments. The company\u2019s growth is expected to be aided by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability. Its Apptio portfolio of enterprise agile planning (EAP), IT financial management and cloud FinOps solutions was recently made available on Microsoft Azure \u2013 the cloud computing platform of Microsoft Corporation MSFT. IBM also expanded the global availability of its software portfolio to 14 additional countries on the Azure Marketplace to better serve customers on their digital transformation journeys. IBM\u2019s EAP software eases the operation silos by helping portfolio managers and finance teams plan, manage budgets and align workforces across various technology priorities. The software integrates seamlessly with Azure DevOps to provide simplified management, increased efficiencies and potential cost savings by allowing clients to use Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments.\n\nBased in California, HashiCorp is a software company that enables organizations to efficiently automate multi-cloud and hybrid environments with its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management solutions. With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which has led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and highly interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM\u2019s acquisition of HCP is a probable ploy to address these issues. Representing an enterprise value of $6.4 billion, the deal will significantly augment IBM\u2019s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. Moreover, HashiCorp\u2019s tool sets will likely complement IBM RedHat\u2019s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management. The integration of HCP\u2019s cloud software capabilities is expected to bolster IBM\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud approach with synergistic benefits and is likely to be accretive to earnings.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation IBM has welcomed 2025 with an apparent glitch in its effort to develop a comprehensive suite of modernized cloud security and compliance solutions with the proposed acquisition of HashiCorp Inc. HCP. The deal, inked in April 2024, faced a last-minute intervention by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d) \u2013 the United Kingdom\u2019s antitrust regulator \u2013 as it seeks to investigate whether the transaction lessens fair competition in the market. The Phase 1 investigation will give CMA until Feb. 25 to conclude whether a full-blown Phase 2 investigation is required into the deal. Interested parties will have until Jan. 16 to make their concerns known.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWatsonx Platform: IBM\u2019s Core Technology for AI\n\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning, the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lake house architecture and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\n\nIBM\u2019s Price Performance\n\nBuoyed by strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, IBM has surged 36.1% over the past year compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 7.6%, outperforming peers like Microsoft but lagging Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimate Revision Trend of IBM\n\nIBM is currently witnessing an uptrend in estimate revisions. Earnings estimates for 2024 have jumped 4% to $10.16 over the past year, while the same for 2025 has increased 1.7% to $10.61. The positive estimate revision portrays bullish sentiments about the stock\u2019s growth potential.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Valuation Metric\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, IBM appears to be trading at a premium relative to the industry and is trading well above its mean. Going by the price/book ratio, the company shares currently trade at 8.29, higher than 3.19 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 5.85.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEnd Note\n\nIBM aims to benefit from the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and generative AI solutions. With a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment and quantum computing, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has led to a healthy demand trend for a hybrid-cloud approach.\n\n\n\nIBM hybrid cloud blends public cloud, private cloud and on-premises infrastructure to develop a single, flexible, cost-optimal IT infrastructure. The proposed acquisition of HashiCorp will create a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform built for AI-driven complexity, delivering clients extensive application, infrastructure and security lifecycle management capabilities. Although the scrutiny by the anti-trust regulator has created a temporary roadblock, the transaction is likely to get a green signal as it aims to fulfill IBM\u2019s long-term vision of developing a robust and resilient cloud portfolio catering to the diverse needs of businesses across sectors.\n\n\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), IBM appears primed for further price appreciation.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the CMA is inviting public feedback on the merger until January 16, 2025, as it evaluates whether the acquisition warrants a deeper investigation.\n\nIn its announcement on Monday, the CMA disclosed that it has set a provisional deadline of February 25, 2025, to determine if the deal should proceed or if it requires a more extensive Phase 2 review. However, the authority noted that a decision could come sooner, depending on the progress of its assessment.\n\nCloud Market in Focus\n\nThe CMA\u2019s scrutiny of the merger aligns with its broader examination of the U.K.\u2019s cloud services sector, which has seen increasing regulatory attention in recent years. The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2023, telecommunications regulator Ofcom recommended referring the U.K. cloud market to the CMA for competition review, citing concerns about market dominance and unfair practices among major players. This ongoing focus has now extended to IBM\u2019s attempt to acquire HashiCorp, a prominent provider of cloud provisioning and infrastructure management tools.\n\nRelated: UK\u2019s CMA to Review IBM\u2019s $6.4 Billion Acquisition of HashiCorp\n\nWhile regulatory hearings in the cloud sector have often spotlighted disputes between industry heavyweights like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the CMA\u2019s focus on IBM\u2019s deal underscores the authority\u2019s commitment to scrutinizing consolidation in the tech industry.\n\nPrevious Notification and Context\n\nThis latest development follows an earlier notification in August 2024, when IBM and HashiCorp were informed by the CMA about the initiation of a Phase 1 review. The Wall Street Journal noted that the timing of the CMA\u2019s inquiry suggests potential complexities in the merger, even though such notifications are a standard part of the process.\n\nThe CMA\u2019s decision to probe the IBM-HashiCorp deal was not unexpected, given the regulator\u2019s active role in maintaining competition in fast-evolving sectors like cloud computing. As The Wall Street Journal highlighted, IBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp could have significant implications for the competitive landscape, prompting the watchdog to evaluate whether the merger might stifle innovation or harm consumer choice.\n\nNext Steps and Industry Reactions\n\nInterested parties have until mid-January to submit their comments, after which the CMA will decide whether to escalate the investigation. The regulator\u2019s eventual ruling could have ripple effects across the cloud industry, potentially influencing how similar deals are approached in the future.\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal",

In August the UK regulator signalled it could begin a review of the deal.\n\nThe acquisition was geared towards helping Big Blue enable its cloud clients to \u201cmanage their infrastructure and application sprawl,\u201d to help build a \u201ccomprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era.\u201d\n\nPhase 1 investigation\n\nIBM\u2019s acquisition had been expected to close by the end of 2024, but the UK\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced on Monday that a Phase 1 investigation has begun.\n\nThe CMA said it is investigation the \u201canticipated acquisition\u201d under section 96(2A) of the Enterprise Act 2002.\n\nThe CMA said it has until 25 February 2025 to decide whether the deal merits a full blown phase 2 investigation, but has given a deadline of 16 January for interested parties to make their concerns known.\n\n\u201cThe CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services,\u201d the CMA stated.\n\nHashiCorp\u2019s suite of products provides cloud customers with Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities to enable firms to automate their hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n\nCloudy concerns\n\nThe CMA investigation comes amid UK regulatory concern at the state of the cloud services market.\n\nThe UK probe into the cloud computing sector began in September 2022, when Ofcom had announced it would \u201cexamine the position of Amazon, Microsoft and Google in cloud services,\u201d as part of a \u201cnew programme of work to ensure that digital communications markets are working well for people and businesses in the UK.\u201d\n\nA year later in October 2023 Ofcom announced that its market study had \u201cuncovered features that could limit competition in the cloud segment\u201d.\n\nIt therefore asked the CMA to investigate Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s dominance of the UK cloud market.\n\nIt was reported in November 2024 that the CMA would soon announce \u201cbehavioural\u201d remedies to address anti-competitive practices in the cloud infrastructure industry.\n\nThe CMA in December then delayed its provisional decision until January 2025, rather than the previously slated December 2024.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been two years since the term \u2018generative AI\u2019 started gaining widespread attention. Although it wasn\u2019t new\u2014it appeared on Gartner\u2019s \u2018hype cycle\u2019 as early as 2020\u2014by the end of summer 2022, excitement was mounting around genAI tools capable of generating text, images and computer code.\n\nThe estimated $1-trillion investment in generative AI has yet to deliver widespread returns. As with every tech revolution, the hype will fade and real work will begin. This is where India\u2019s tech industry stands today\u2014at the crossroads of immense opportunity and significant challenges.\n\nIn 2013, the M D Anderson Cancer Center at University of Texas launched a moonshot project to use IBM\u2019s AI-powered Watson system to diagnose certain cancers. By 2017, the $62-million project was paused without being used on patients. Meanwhile, the centre\u2019s IT team explored smaller-scale cognitive tools for tasks like assisting patients\u2019 families, identifying financial aid needs, etc. These efforts proved far more successful. The stark contrast between these two approaches offers valuable insights for anyone planning AI initiatives.\n\nThe Indian market is still in its early stages. There has been a 50 percent decline in the Indian genAI startup funding in the first half of 2024, compared to that of 2023. While there has been a seven-fold increase in activity by the Indian industry, over half are focused on new product launches.\n\nMost Indian organisations are progressing towards mid-level AI/genAI maturity, with defined strategies and initial use cases aimed at scaling. While 75 percent of the 500 companies surveyed by Nasscom have AI strategies at the proof-of-concept (PoC) stage, only 40 percent demonstrate significant progress in moving to production. Collaborative efforts are driving advancements in telecom, enterprise tools and retail applications. There is growing emphasis on domain-specific fine-tuning and development of custom, small language models.\n\nHowever, genAI\u2019s appeal comes from its transformative potential, often amplified by success stories. Despite billions poured into AI/genAI projects, Forbes reports that less than 15 percent of these initiatives make it to production. While there is a clear surge in genAI activities led by a strong uptick in product and go-to-market partnerships, the realisation of substantial, measurable impact remains in early stages.",

More details on the approval will follow. Herein, it will become clear why the CMA didn\u2019t push beyond its initial \u201cPhase 1 investigation.\u201d\n\nIn any case, there\u2019s now no more resistance against the deal expected from the United Kingdom authorities. However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly still investigating whether the deal will be approved. However, there is no word of an official FTC announcement, so it is possible that this has already been resolved behind the scenes.\n\nOriginal article, Dec. 31, 2024:\n\nBritain\u2019s Competitions & Markets Authority is to investigate IBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp. It has launched a \u201claunch of merger inquiry\u201d on the eve of 2024, with a deadline for a final decision on Feb. 25 in the new year.\n\nThe CMA is inviting parties to comment before Jan. 16. This is not just limited to IBM and HashiCorp. Competitors concerned about the potential disruption of competition caused by the deal can also come knocking. As is often the case, the CMA\u2019s message at this stage of the investigation is short and to the point. In fact, the only announcement is that a \u201cPhase 1 investigation\u201d has commenced. It will now be determined whether Phase 2 is necessary, after which an independent panel of experts will consider the implications for a possible takeover. A move to this new phase would likely delay the closing of the acquisition further.\n\nTwo fronts\n\nIn April, IBM confirmed that it wanted to buy HashiCorp for $6.4 billion, just under 6 billion euros at the time. Although Red Hat already belongs to Big Blue\u2019s stable, IBM plans to make HashiCorp an IBM unit focused on cloud infrastructure. This will keep Terraform separate from Red Hat offerings.\n\nThe main prize for IBM, should the deal be allowed, would be HashiCorp\u2019s Terraform tool. With this solution, organizations automate the setup of cloud instances and allocated hardware resources. Other cloud tools focus on security, networking and development environments. Users can access cloud-based variants of these tools through the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).\n\nThe stated ambition by both parties was to complete the takeover before the end of 2024. Those armed with a calendar, however, can readily see that this will tricky to pull off. In addition to the CMA, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also been investigating the takeover attempt since July.\n\nNo certainty yet\n\nBecause of this initial investigation by the British antitrust watchdog, the viability of IBM\u2019s takeover of HashiCorp is uncertain at this time. Nevertheless, nothing can be gleaned from the basic fact that an investigation has been launched into the matter. For example, the Broadcom acquisition of VMware was finally approved by the CMA in August 2023 after an investigation was launched in January of that year. However, it needn\u2019t come to an actual CMA decision sometimes for an acquisition attempt to be scuttled. During the CMA investigation over Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Arm, the latter decided to call a halt to proceedings on its own.\n\nAlso read: US antitrust watchdog wants more details on IBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp",

Comments from interested parties are invited by January 16, 2025. The deadline for the watchdog's decision on taking things further is February 25, 2025, although the announcement might come earlier.\n\nThe CMA's decision is unsurprising, although the timing is not ideal. In August, HashiCorp and IBM received a notification from the CMA that it intended to begin a Phase 1 review of the merger.\n\nIt's not uncommon for the CMA to notify affected parties of an impending investigation [PDF], although the timescale suggests that there might be some complexities involved.\n\nIn particular, the CMA has been examining the UK's cloud services market. In 2023, the UK's telecommunications regulator Ofcom suggested that the country's cloud market should be referred to the competition watchdog.\n\nWhile much of the hot air during regulatory hearings has been generated by giants such as Microsoft and AWS pointing fingers at each other and protesting against remedies that might affect their businesses, it was somewhat inevitable that IBM's decision to snap up cloud provisioning business HashiCorp would come under scrutiny from the authority.\n\nIn July, HashiCorp stated that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would also be reviewing the acquisition, according to a filing made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company's shareholders also voted to approve the acquisition.\n\nThe deal was announced earlier in 2024. IBM intends to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion and make the cloud infrastructure outfit part of its software business rather than fold it into Red Hat. The intention is for IBM's customers to be able to make use of HashiCorp's technology, such as Terraform, to manage their cloud estates better.\n\nThe hope then, and even as recently as HashiCorp's HashiConf get-together in October, was that the deal would be closed by the end of 2024.\n\nTwo days remain in 2024, and the UK's competition regulator has opened a merger inquiry.\n\nThe Register asked IBM and HashiCorp for their reaction to the launch of the merger inquiry, and will update this piece should either respond. \u00ae",

(Photo: Shutterstock)\n\nThe UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened a phase 1 investigation into IBM\u2019s planned $6.4bn acquisition of multi-cloud infrastructure automation company HashiCorp. The inquiry seeks to determine whether the deal could significantly impact competition in the UK\u2019s cloud and IT markets.\n\nThe British competition watchdog\u2019s decision to commence the phase 1 probe follows its confirmation that the merger notice submitted by IBM and HashiCorp complies with the requirements set out in section 96(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002. The review formally begins on 31 December 2024, initiating a critical assessment period that will run until 25 February 2025. By that date, the CMA must decide whether the merger will require further scrutiny under a phase 2 investigation. The regulator has clarified that while 25 February is the current deadline for a decision, extensions or adjustments to this timeline are possible depending on the progress of the merger assessment.\n\nThe primary focus of the phase 1 investigation is to assess whether the merger constitutes a \u201crelevant merger situation\u201d as defined under UK competition law. The CMA will examine whether the transaction, if completed, could lead to a substantial lessening of competition in any UK market for goods or services.\n\nAs part of this evaluation, the CMA has invited stakeholders and other interested parties to provide written comments regarding potential competition issues arising from the merger. These submissions will inform the authority\u2019s decision on whether the transaction warrants a deeper phase 2 probe.\n\nThe investigation is being conducted against a backdrop of heightened scrutiny of the cloud services sector in the UK. Ofcom, the UK\u2019s telecommunications regulator, recently recommended a closer examination of competition within the cloud industry, adding to the regulatory attention surrounding the IBM-HashiCorp merger.\n\nStrategic rationale for the acquisition\n\nIBM\u2019s acquisition of HashiCorp, announced in April 2024, is a significant step in its strategy to expand its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings. Under the agreement, HashiCorp shareholders will receive $35 per share.\n\nListed on the Nasdaq, HashiCorp offers expertise in automating hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Its suite of tools, including Terraform for infrastructure lifecycle management, plays a critical role in enabling organisations to scale their IT operations efficiently. By integrating HashiCorp\u2019s capabilities with Red Hat\u2019s Ansible Automation Platform, IBM aims to simplify the provisioning and configuration of hybrid cloud environments.\n\nThrough the merger, IBM aims to bolster its commitment in technologies it views as central to future growth, such as data security, IT automation, and consulting services. The deal is also claimed to position IBM as a leader in hybrid cloud solutions, an area of increasing importance for modern enterprises.\n\nThe CMA\u2019s phase 1 probe is part of a broader pattern of regulatory attention on the deal. HashiCorp disclosed in an 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it was notified by the CMA in August 2024 of the pending review. The acquisition is also under review by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), reflecting the global scale of regulatory interest in the transaction.",

IBM's current vision is trained on AI and data platform Watsonx and hybrid-cloud-focused Red Hat OpenShift in particular - having acquired Red Hat in 2019 .\n\nKey business use cases include code modernization, customer service, and digital labor. Cloud market share in Q3 2024 near level-pegged with Oracle, matching Salesforce, Tencent, and Huawei with 2% of the market.\n\nAlthough Big Blue won't reveal its partner numbers, estimates have suggested around 55,000 partners, including 12,000 in the US, ranging from NTT Data Business Solutions, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to MySQL, AgilOne, Cohesive, Insight, Shi International and more.\n\nKey offerings\n\nIBM's latest Watson-lineage platform W atsonx is billed as a productivity, code quality, and customer experience (CX) facilitator, incorporating core AI, data, and governance.\n\nIts Granite AI large language models aim at high-performance enterprise tasks from cybersecurity to retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\n\nMeanwhile Red Hat OpenShift , following IBM's acquisition of Red Hat in 2019, targets an estimated two-thirds of organizations struggling to manage complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments - especially as more businesses grapple with genAI in the cloud.\n\nChannel Pro Newsletter Stay up to date with the latest Channel industry news and analysis with our twice-weekly newsletter Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe on-demand enterprise platform IBM Cloud helps build out many solutions. For instance, Watsonx AI and IBM Cloud, complemented by ML, assist complex analyses of population, infrastructure, urbanization, elevation, land use, and satellite data for electricity-access forecasting out to 2030.\n\nAlong similar AI and hybrid cloud-focused lines, the \"VM as a service\" IBM Power Virtual Server was announced at IBM Think 2024 as a platform for workloads including AI and for extending on-premises environments into the cloud.\n\nRecent news:\n\nJust before Christmas 2024, IBM announced a tie-up with Lockheed Martin, integrating Granite into its AI Factory tools for aerospace and defense innovation.\n\nOctober 2024 saw IBM launch the third version of high-performing Granite LLM AI for enterprise data.\n\nIn January 2024, Krishna said in an earnings call that its genAI and Watsonx \"book of business\" had doubled from its Q3 \"low hundreds of millions\", with demand continuing to rise.\n\nIBM for partners\n\nChannel chief is Kate Woolley, whose official title is General Manager, IBM Ecosystem. Reportedly , IBM hopes to generate 80% of revenues via its partner ecosystem in three to five years - up from 40% of revenues in 2023 and 15% two years before that.\n\nIn the same IBM Think 2023 interview for Partner Plus day, IBM senior vice president of software and chief commercial officer Rob Thomas suggested it seeks new customers spending $25,000-$50,000, to grow to $250,000 over three or four years post-acquisition.\n\nWhile Big Blue was initially slow to monetize AI , it's since been targeting the recruitment of hundreds of partners for Watsonx alone. In October, Woolley said it \"takes a village\" to bridge AI skills and cost gaps. \"AI is projected to unlock $16 trillion in value by 2030, generating opportunity for technology providers of all shapes and sizes.\"\n\nWhy partners matter\n\nAccording to Woolley at TechXChange, its partner-first strategy reflects its recognition that business transformation needs can't be met by vendors alone. \"The power of AI technology is only as great as its ability to get into the hands of developers, open-source communities, and business users,\" she said.\n\nFor instance, IBM plans to continue building agent capabilities across its portfolio in 2025, including pre-built agents for specific domains and use cases.\n\nIntroducing the new Partner Plus program Services Track in January 2024, Woolley wrote about the ongoing importance of IBM\u2019s partner-first focus.\n\n\"Consultancies, advisory firms, systems integrators (SIs) and managed services providers (MSPs) are a vital part of the IBM Ecosystem,\" she said.\n\nPartner programs, tiers, and partner types\n\nIBM Partner Plus replaced PartnerWorld as the linchpin partner program in 2023. With Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers and a new-partner accelerator program, it has refreshed incentives, co-marketing, and demand generation approaches.\n\nFor instance, meeting Silver criteria, accepting IBM Partner Plus Program Benefits terms, and the Know Your IBM Attachment means they can use the IBM Software Access Catalog, and allow customers to evaluate IBM Software for up to 90 days.\n\nA Blue designation exists separately for IBM strategic partners -- typically cloud service providers and infrastructure or software vendors such as Cisco or SAP working with both IBM Consulting and IBM Technology solutions.\n\nPartner Plus has Build, Sell, and Service tracks:\n\nIBM Build partners - independent software developers (ISVs) and MSPs - integrate and extend IBM technologies. AI and hybrid cloud, unsurprisingly, are foci.\n\npartners - independent software developers (ISVs) and MSPs - integrate and extend IBM technologies. and hybrid cloud, unsurprisingly, are foci. IBM Sell partners funnel into data and AI, hybrid cloud, automation, sustainability, and storage areas.\n\npartners funnel into data and AI, hybrid cloud, automation, sustainability, and storage areas. IBM Service partners - SIs or consultancies - can build practices and Centers of Excellence for IBM technologies.\n\nFurther benefits, rewards, and incentives\n\nAs usual, a wealth of resources exist, including a partner portal.\n\nPartner demand generation programs, including the demand engine with marketing kits, joint-marketing support, and access to incremental marketing funds.\n\nAuto deal share to eligible partners for opportunities of less than $250,000.\n\nReal-time visibility into earnings and deal eligibility.\n\nAI deal share engine for lead generation.\n\nInsider programs, IBM education and training.\n\nCompetitive pricing, deal protection, and special-bid access.\n\nTutorials. For instance for registering cloud services with the IBM Cloud Partner Center.\n\nwith the IBM Cloud Partner Center. Value seller tool for preferred pricing.\n\nGlobal technical resources.\n\nPersonalized support via the partner support desk.\n\nIBM offers to answer questions via the partner login . An IBMid is needed to log in to the partner portal - go here to create an account .\n\nHow to get on board\n\nYou can sign up here to enquire about a partnership. Again, you'll likely need an IBMid to tell the vendor about your organization and how you'd like to partner.\n\nOnce registration is approved, new partners should select an onboarding distributor or tech broker to further guide them through the process. After accepting the terms, IBM emails confirmation of the next steps. New partners are onboarded with the Partner Accelerator for six months, which offers direct assistance, onboarding training, and marketing and sales materials.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other best nanotechnology stocks to buy.\n\nNanotechnology, a groundbreaking concept introduced by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 during a speech at Caltech, focuses on working with materials at an incredibly small scale\u2014between one and 100 nanometers. At the nanoscale, things get interesting\u2014surface area and quantum effects start playing a big role in how materials behave. Nanotechnology thus focuses on understanding and harnessing these unique properties, covering all kinds of research and technologies that take advantage of them.\n\nSmall Science VS Big Impact\n\nOne of the most exciting applications of nanotechnology is in the semiconductor industry. Today\u2019s cutting-edge chips, like those powering iPhones and AI processors, rely on transistors that are just a few nanometers wide. Nanotechnology also plays a crucial role in improving semiconductor manufacturing, with specialized coatings and treatments that enhance equipment durability and efficiency, cutting downtime and boosting output.\n\nHealthcare is another sector transformed by nanotechnology, becoming a cornerstone of modern biomedicine. From improving cancer diagnosis to enabling targeted drug delivery and advancing pharmaceutical manufacturing, it\u2019s transforming the quality of treatments and boosting patient outcomes. This progress has led to the rise of nanomedicine, a field focused on innovative diagnostics, disease prevention, and streamlined drug development. In drug delivery, nanoscale technologies enhance how medications work by improving their stability and effectiveness. Perhaps the most exciting breakthrough is nanorobots\u2014tiny machines that can travel through the bloodstream to deliver drugs precisely where they\u2019re needed. This approach not only boosts precision but also reduces side effects, paving the way for more personalized and efficient treatments.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) drives much of the research and development in this field. With participation from 30 federal agencies, the program underscores nanotechnology\u2019s growing importance. The NNI\u2019s 2024 budget request of $2.16 billion\u2014the largest yet\u2014focuses on both fundamental research and real-world applications. Given the trade tensions with China, which leads the world in nanotech startups, this investment is likely to grow, highlighting the strategic value of staying at the forefront of nanotechnology innovation.",

We\u2019re just getting used to a new AI era. Still, there\u2019s no room for lingering these days, and scientists, engineers, and others are already preparing for the next tech evolution, sparking excitement and intrigue simultaneously. Quantum technology promises to revolutionize all industries with its unparalleled processing power.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nWhile many small-cap quantum stocks such as Rigetti Computing (RGTI) or IonQ (IONQ) have bloated their value, they present high volatility, risk, and unrealistic valuation. Just take a look at Rigetti\u2019s P/S ratio to get an idea. In contrast, International Business Machines (IBM), the oldest tech company trading on Wall Street, offers a more stable way to gain exposure to this new-born industry.\n\nIf you wish to read more about IBM\u2019s fortunes, you can check out what our analyst at Tipranks, Mike Byrne, wrote about the company right here. Now, let\u2019s explore three key reasons why IBM stands out as a better choice for investors looking to invest in the quantum realm:\n\nExperience and Technological Leadership: IBM has been a pioneer in quantum computing since the 1990s. The company already provides access to high-performance quantum computers with over 100 qubits and charges customers $96 per minute!!! To use these powerful machines. IBM\u2019s extensive experience and established infrastructure in quantum computing give it a significant edge over newer, less-proven companies.\n\nReasonable Valuation and Financial Stability: Unlike many small-cap quantum stocks positioned years from profitability, IBM is already a profitable company with a reasonable valuation. It trades at 22 times earnings, slightly below the broader market average, and at just 3.5 times revenue. This contrasts with companies like Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which trade at astronomical valuations of 392 and 250 times sales, respectively. IBM\u2019s financial stability and diversified business model provide a safer investment with exposure to quantum computing\u2019s potential upside.\n\nStrong Dividend and Long-Term Growth Prospects: IBM has a long history of paying dividends, making it a rare quantum stock offering investors income. The company has paid dividends for 35 consecutive years and has increased its payout for the past 25 years, earning it the status of a Dividend Aristocrat. With a current yield of 2.99%, IBM provides a steady income stream significantly higher than the S&P 500\u2019s average yield. Additionally, IBM\u2019s involvement in significant quantum research projects and its recent unveiling of the Condor processor, the first to surpass 1,000 qubits, position it well for future growth in the quantum computing market.\n\nIs IBM a Buy or a Sell?\n\nOn Wall Street, IBM is considered a Moderate Buy. The average price target for IBM stock is $230.92, suggesting a 3.65% upside potential.\n\nSee more IBM analyst ratings\n\nTakeaway\n\nSince Google released its new quantum chip, Willow, the new-born industry has become the newest sensation for investors wanting to get a ticket before the prices skyrocket to unreasonable amounts. Small companies like Rigetti and IonQ have enjoyed growing enthusiasm and increasing their value. However, their valuation still seems unwarranted, considering they are not close to being profitable. Enter IBM.\n\nThe technological veteran has been working in the quantum field since the 1990s and is one of the leading forces in quantum computing and AI. It is also a profitable business that offers a nice quarterly dividend as a bonus. When we combine all this, we get a solid, even if unspectacular, option to invest in the new and exciting quantum industry.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",
